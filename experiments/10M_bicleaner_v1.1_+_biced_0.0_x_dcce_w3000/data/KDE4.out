the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in spite of its low size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; making them easier available .
for more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual too &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
to upload these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select settings extensions ... Open the card card tools and select the required modules there .
this is a list of standard modules from the package k@@ de ; add@@ on . please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the package k@@ de@@ base , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; containing this package .
to use the crash module , click on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; click into extras . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to the crash , if available , delete .
the load@@ able module ( also called folder @-@ filter ) , you can reach in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; tool@@ bar at extras In@@ quer@@ or . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory to different kind .
to use the DO@@ M construction supervision in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; use extras DO@@ M tree ... and therefore open a new window with the DO@@ M of the current site . as a Pres@@ entation , the display begins with the root appearance of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ ations , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this wor@@ shi@@ fter .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; another view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / Directory can be used in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text views , so that you can view the content of your local file system .
the particul@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of inter@@ locking folder , folder , with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . each object is proportion@@ ate to its size , whose surface is proportion@@ ate to its size . this size must own the property that the sum of sizes of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then can be realized , even if a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command@@ ls you are considered .
in the FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap presentation provides a rectang@@ le that represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . simpler navigation , the leg@@ is@@ ions possess useful color and conf@@ lic@@ ting settings .
the color of a rectang@@ le , which is swit@@ ched via view is swit@@ ched on , can either be depth for the light detection of the sp@@ ur@@ tel@@ esc@@ ope or the illustration of another file as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rectang@@ le can be described with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature you can specify , if there is enough space to display or whether the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ate rectang@@ le should be used ( whereby , consequently , dis@@ appearing defects by constra@@ ints in the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap may occur ) . in addition , you can specify the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the rectang@@ le .
if the h@@ iring algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps should be observed that the area is proportion@@ ate to the size of the item . if the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always respected . there will be frame that is no longer available for the pres@@ ump@@ tion of entries , and that frame is needed , which is less space for the frame when the rectang@@ le square is square .
as sharing the area of an agreement for sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries is made , the implementation will be left . on this occasion , it is possible for the circum@@ cis@@ ed and for the prevention of space pl@@ ain@@ es by means always advantageous surfaces . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recru@@ iting ground @-@ division .
you can specify the minim@@ ised surface for an entry above the menu item . instead , a single pattern is drawn in the area of the higher @-@ ordered item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets thought that has been developed for the application of Red@@ ag@@ egr@@ ind .

you can also visit the di@@ gi@@ val ; homepage to visit news about shared versions and other information on &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; to experience .
the best start to get started &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; registration is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions to work in the developer mailing list of &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; .
if you want &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter a local name or folder the folder symbol to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data collection is stored . this path remains the same for all the sc@@ ord@@ ner .
later , you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; will use you in addition as an Al@@ en@@ library . settings di@@ gi@@ ano@@ int collections

modern digital cameras are marked by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera will also be realised as a record system . the camera can also be realized through the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras will be used in connection with the serial Port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; used the program from a Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital cameras , which has a constantly increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol , which was developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows transferring images of digital cameras to b@@ ills and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . as photos in general are large files and transmission systems are out@@ dated . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; supports these cameras and introduces the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ osp@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to be reli@@ ably read by di@@ gi@@ Kam . if the ex@@ change@@ able support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photographs , if the ex@@ change@@ able support is not in lib@@ g@@ photographs , however , you might be nothing to see or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to come to &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; it is how easy to extend its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to a common module structure for &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the objective is to provide the modules to all video programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as there is also a user . their advantage is that it &apos;s much easier now , &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; through writing a small module to supplement a function than the changes in &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam , perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .

the first thing you do and need to know before you maintain something inside your system is the structure information structure in contrast to data structure . your image files must somehow be organised on your computer , whether you want to save it on a reservation drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; be@@ ware at some point you have to change to a larger drive .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly on your location . if you are in a year several times at the same place . if you make enough photos , you &apos;ll be sub@@ folders as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . simply export a folder for images you are printing or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements like ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archi@@ ving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % files and 5 % of work are generated and you will then not be able to organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of data types makes the st@@ acks easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and labour @-@ files simpli@@ fied a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a sealed painting .
we also recommend option met@@ adata save in the list of met@@ adata in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; this ensures that Ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be written into the file . if you forget this , then you can save the met@@ adata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the menu Album Sett@@ ings .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens when you want to change it ? it provides them with a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes , these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , since you can now choose any photo keywords , indic@@ ating and evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that take the same attri@@ bute and set the value then . this makes sense as you can focus on the best pictures at work .
let &apos;s now let us deal with key@@ word , keywords , how you frequently continue using other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalog pictures from another source with built @-@ in sam@@ pling , then the tree for you would like to insert the pictures in the right place . the circum@@ s@@ orting of Hier@@ archy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by pul@@ ling an under@@ tree on another . the modified keywords are removed from &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; updated while it pursu@@ es the sub @-@ trees .
the graphic shows how different met@@ adata are over@@ l@@ apped . this is a very large represent@@ ations , as each block of met@@ adata in truth consists of many sections . data names and cal@@ ender data are characteristics of all images .
enough the keywords - the next section refers to conf@@ lic@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your met@@ adata .
you just want to see most of your photos simply because you want to share them with your friends , family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos .
check out this panorama . coming from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you that this is the cross @-@ place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing . Wow ! it begins to dream , associations , memories , the historic period of time is again present , you might even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this Panor@@ amas completely .
for others who look at your photos , the title may possibly be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you look at images you should transfer a story . remember , the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer to help Him about the mot@@ if you are moving to understand what you understand .
it is just fine when a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a lab@@ eling for itself alone .
with &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; you can use any amount of text , exported in an internation@@ alized Alp@@ hab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , when you export your pictures into Web galleries , then these alleg@@ ations will be exported to your wishes in the lab@@ eling and / or the title of the web @-@ gallery system . so you have to tell the story for the ren@@ unci@@ ation of no second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? was this earth not a te@@ di@@ ous planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? good , because with pictures drives the train of the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
the possibilities of Geol@@ ocation is already countless , and will continue in the future further far . I am sure that one day , you can enjoy your travel virtually . you can also export the images on the recording site . you can also export the images from G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps @-@ view .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a word play with copyright and identi@@ fies the practice the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedom also apply in all changed versions , so also for work of others .
the following description tells you which information in the inaugur@@ ation page of &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; should be depos@@ ited as a information :
the author ( syn@@ onym for creators , and Writ@@ er ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , e.g. to use the name of a company or organisation . this field does not support comm@@ as nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
Aut@@ ort@@ it@@ el ( syn@@ onym for fi@@ del@@ er ) : associated with the author . this field contains the working record of the photographer . examples of this may be titles as : employed photographer , fre@@ el@@ ance photographer or inde@@ er commercial photographer , because this is a note of the au@@ sp@@ iny field , this field must be filled out .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for vendors ) : use the off@@ erer to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily need to be the author . if the photograph is working here for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group / Agency will put the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this does not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator , can delete or change the solution for this problem is digital water@@ mark . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and half @-@ professionals , this protection is very important for it .
the digital water@@ mark is unique for each image . it was in the near future to provide such a module for st@@ acks .

of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that can be lost on the street or a fire . these types of losses are the same which can also happen to you with traditional paper pictures or negative things . in this section , we address problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data collection company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs must be treated in cau@@ ti@@ ous and you can no longer buy CDs and DVDs in the archive quality , which are more difficult to get more difficult and considerably more expensive . there are offers about gold @-@ coated DVDs , £ 2 , which claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe it is in your brass space .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can use this risk in which you store good dis@@ ks and good track record and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable . so it turns into the right choice .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors , even if you were just written only . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ att@@ ing and control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection , they are needed by chemical aging , ul@@ tra@@ violet light , scr@@ at@@ ches , dust , etc .
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there are a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which does appear to do wonders on CDs and DVDs . it is also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the def@@ ective data of damaged disk@@ ettes , hard@@ disk , Flash media , USB drives , etc .
visual media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the For@@ mat@@ war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six@@ sm@@ al the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything that has been said to CDs and DVDs also applies to Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slow with a good recording facility on high quality media in a non propri@@ etary format . then read out the media with a description , date &amp; author features , and afterwards on a clean , dark dry and shel@@ tered spot traffic . do not forget to copy the data on the next generation of media before using the latest piece of hardware or software that can read the media .
Disk@@ Mark retain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturing conflict require a new disk , but not the data . Google poses a large field study on the subject of the error @-@ mechanisms of hard@@ dis@@ ks : dis@@ inf@@ alli@@ ed
soon : dis@@ ks remain at the longest if you are operated in the temper@@ ing range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . with lower heat removal , SM@@ ART this error may not determine . some of the SM@@ ART reported error occurred at the immediate forthcoming result . this is especially Les@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and Verlag@@ ation@@ stechnik . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is just the complete loss account of over@@ strain . of course , you may also have data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be made back without major problems .
while most electrical devices stream do not do much , it looks different in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause serious harm . on your computer , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause hardware replacement , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . so you protect themselves from the irre@@ ver@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against black@@ heads is an Over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that a portion of energy heat absorbed and the rest assured . it is usually available in form of a plug @-@ in . however , remember that not every plug @-@ in also contains an Over@@ voltage protection .
if you look out for an Over@@ voltage protection , then you should be sure that he meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a specific minimum of protection . you should also take care of it protects protection against flash envel@@ ope and therefore protects the correctly associated devices .
because the voltage of each cable can use to your computer , you should be sure that all the periph@@ er@@ als are connected to your system . some manufacturers face an tension @-@ cap when also included a telephone connection for your mo@@ dem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ ax@@ ial cable of the cable mo@@ de@@ ms and television card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will require a portable Over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and are very small and you also contain the protection of the mo@@ dem .
while an Over@@ voltage protection system protects your system from smaller fluctu@@ ations into the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete case . even a drop of a few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be sensible in a @-@ breaking power supply .
besides the protection from over@@ tension , these devices can automatically collect accum@@ ulator when a power drop . this gives you the opportunity to store your data and run the system sorted by the electricity . if you purchase a US@@ V then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements like an Over@@ voltage protection . moreover , the lifetime of the battery and the underlying software is interesting .
concerns the potential risk that is exposed to your b@@ illing system and compare its safety at electricity disorders that cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you think about how well your computer is protected by it . finally , you should remember all cables before you go to the holidays .
the Amazon Web @-@ Service contains S3 @-@ Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the right configuration you can use it as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup goal for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
they are compared to the hard disk drives , but very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general f@@ uses . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available on photos . their free memory is available in full resolution online . the professional version puts you more at your disposal in case of Flick@@ r dramatically more . for 25 $ a year you will receive un@@ restricted memory , which should be checked in reality first .
from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically calculated thanks to the TCP protocol and with the big companies included in the offer a backup and a distribut@@ ing memory .
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission belts in calcul@@ ator . all transfers are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs put at least the database integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one says when a transfer error occurred , not when this occurred in your hardware . it &apos;s quite distur@@ bing that there is no protection to you in your computer . no one seems to have thought of it . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer file than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable network parts are a further source of transmission belts as they create interference within the data flows . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors are un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with turn@@ outs on lower levels and is available among one to the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope it soon also available for Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in the alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms of the fs and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not yet part of the core .
under@@ estimate this not ! these two factors are for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % for the workplace . not@@ ebooks is already the share of rob@@ ber@@ y 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most of these . it results in a lower damage , such as theft or new installation . and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer have been seen .
open source file systems are less pr@@ one to collect data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ s , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the spread file systems . a very good English articles can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : false , only the speed of the investig@@ ating process during a sudden inter@@ ruption of operation is higher and an in@@ defin@@ ately status will be avoided if a file is not completely stored before the problem appeared , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human error is the root causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it means that while the technology is further developed , there is a natural fron@@ tier for this progress . sens@@ itiveness and space car@@ vings for all types of light sensors are not far away from that border .
today cameras go towards the 10 Meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and a high quality op@@ tics , the optimum size for comp@@ actor cameras . even DSLR Cam@@ eras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard drive can be achieved today for 100 &amp; euro . so do not make anyone else for data loss in every year . so secure your data often after a plan and test this back before you get some hazardous like the re@@ install of your operating system to make the exchange of hard disk drives , or sizes of hard disk drives .
suppose you daily make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash suggests you are lucky when the drive is not connected at the moment .
a disaster comes locally and destroyed a lot . forget aircraft UFO , fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they normally concern an entire room or the complete house .
hence , Des@@ cent does not mean a local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stair@@ way up into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files will be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot without history , and represents a complete copy at a time .
differ@@ ing protection : a backup of the files changed since the last complete assurance . generates a complete snap@@ shot at two times : the complete assurance and that of the last discre@@ pan@@ cies .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup began . you can restore the original status at any time . this backup comes to a version of version , next with the exception that it is only scr@@ am@@ pled and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool you can be easily installed on your machines . unlike script controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer @-@ scripts , r@@ sync only the difference of files that have been changed . this is comp@@ ressed and if you want to increase security about ssh .
make important images directly after you stored them on your computer to DVD or another op@@ t@@ ic medium .
this course of course leaves you enough time to discover losses and restore . at the same time , you come back to secure it . at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least a month and a snap@@ shot every month . each further th@@ inner should be done manually , after which you have done a complete review .
topics : Met@@ adata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , Associ@@ ated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , reflec@@ tions , ... , use of the internet .
allowing us to survive the next 40 years that is about the tim@@ esp@@ ace in which you truly are interested in your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that you should be observed :
since the future because of your nature is un@@ predic@@ table , you must look at everything today . unfortunately , there is no other possibility than a certain vig@@ il@@ ance to leave . unfortunately every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system are backward . the less variations you have used in the past , the more easily it &apos;s the questions of the future to evaluate .
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alisation is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that reading your pictures is important , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your machine architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should review your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the priority for the possibility to change a system in its great@@ ness . this is actually always growing .
let &apos;s suppose you plan the scal@@ ability with them and you want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift to a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang it on .
B / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ db / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and re@@ iser@@ fs &amp; dollars ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad c@@ 1 # change the size of re@@ iser@@ fs if needed
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day one software is able to read more , then you can create this yourself . this task is easier from year to year .
GI@@ F is a propri@@ etary , pat@@ ented format which dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you should therefore not use it any more .
PNG was designed as an open source standard to replace GI@@ F . but it can save much more . it is dis@@ able to save X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per colour col@@ later@@ als and Chrom@@ ebooks . this format is relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF needed and a slow comp@@ ression . this format we want to recommend you to stor@@ ing your images .
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF may be stored in un@@ comp@@ ressed form or in a container with a ver@@ itable comp@@ ression sal@@ ary mus ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . however , some cameras will be stored in this format . however , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digit@@ ale Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open @-@ format format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG is developed at the TI@@ FF / EP format and is obliged to use met@@ adata . a handful of camera manufacturers will now be available and we hope that the co @-@ competition Canon and Nikon it will use some time .
this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; auto@@ ensi@@ ble Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a characteristic of XML and R@@ DF . the file information will be stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers prefer to be an original of your recording , mostly in raw format , to archive . X@@ MP doesn &apos;t fit , because it saves the met@@ adata separate from the image file . however , you can think about whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ adata standards , which includes a large area of applications and mod@@ elling , discussions and community involvement in the D@@ CM@@ I Communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard communication and educational efforts to reach a virtual acceptance of met@@ adata &apos;s standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card@@ holder or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera level , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert DVD files to D@@ NG and save it in your resource archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fin@@ alized processing you can use external programs . if you have the pictures again with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; edit , then you should cut the met@@ adata again . these have under certain circumstances be cut off from the other programs .
protect the edited images for copyright issues with a digital water@@ mark . just export them to MPEG , use in MPEG , use in contact leaves , print , etc .
the camera connector is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; in the section Add a photos to an album you can add a description of how you can already add on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your Alb@@ end@@ at@@ database .
to run your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ era ; connect it with the PC , turn the camera onto the display mode and turn them into . a further description of this can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , try to connect with your camera . with some cameras it may appear a little indicator . if this is the case , the fil@@ ename and a symbol for the file is displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you might need to check the camera information about each entry . with the side@@ car properties and met@@ adata from the camera interface you can see the characteristics of an item or its met@@ adata .
this dialog shows file features and the photo information that can be stored on the camera internally . a symbol indicates that the picture is not yet available to your computer . please note that some digital cameras will not be available for any information .
the tab met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata like ex@@ if , manufacturing , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as with the met@@ adata page left out of the main window of &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; or the image processing . keep in mind that these met@@ adata are not available for some digital cameras .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection from all . this invites the photos to be deleted and we recommend you check if the images are sure to be downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can select only the selected using standard method of selecting &amp; k@@ de ; once you choose the photos , use the button download and then download the selected . the button chosen is long out , until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option new download is available . these pictures have not been downloaded from &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; once you choose this option , the new images can be downloaded with a star in the window display . if you choose this option , you will only download the new images .
when you use the buttons all download or use selected , appears a dialogue with which you can select the target album , shown in which the photos will be sorted , displayed in section My albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after watching the target album , press OK , and &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam , invites the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of this by using the button Del@@ ete All . if you just want to delete some , then you have to select it first and use the delete fil@@ tering .
note that there are no possibility to recover from the camera to restore it . you should therefore check carefully if the photos were successful into a &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; -@@ album were downloaded , before you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to completely delete it from the camera , you should make this above the camera screen , since this is essentially faster .
cameras use as fil@@ ename for the photographs are often not particularly meaningful ones , after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can be useful to add pictures of different capture criteria in the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was taken to integrate into the fil@@ ename .
in the next section you will find options on the turning point and mir@@ rors of the picture and for dat@@ ashe@@ ing hyp@@ ns . if you use this option , automatically a folder per day is created .
the options Dur@@ ing the transmission opens three more options that are carried out before the photos on the record can be stored on the disk . the first two concern the data about the author in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all images up@@ loaded .
if you want another pattern format as standard format , you can use for example in the editing field the pre@@ fix photo@@ - % Y@@ - % M@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . place the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the instruction must be str@@ f@@ intimate .
when you use option camera file , you have the possibility to alter the fil@@ ename in lo@@ wer@@ case letters . or in big letters if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; for a photo is used , is displayed below the name , which provides the camera in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera system next time .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to make use of recording . not all cameras make this information available . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ adata you can read further details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually swit@@ ched , and if your camera does not provide this information , leaves &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; the photo in its original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the button below and choose the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
when your camera was made information about the date where the photo has been made available , can be &amp; di@@ gi@@ on ; this sub@@ section is based on image data . all the images with the same date will be loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras will provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a @-@ data you can read what information your camera could embedded in the photos .
this option is normally off , and in this case stores it , and in this case stores it . if you want to change it , you need to switch this option . use the button Con@@ sky@@ line and select the option dating back to the bottom end of the window .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to load photos from their computer on their camera is the button download . then select upload . the file sel@@ ections dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you choose the files that are to be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
once the selection process is done , asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; you where the images will be loaded up . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the folder and press OK to start the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general term in this document . it is a position that can be indicated in long@@ itude and lat@@ itude and that can be displayed on a map . the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional photo graph@@ s it can be interesting to link a picture with an unprecedented geographical place . not everyone uses a plane to car@@ account an area by automatic inclusion of GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , architectural , architectural , and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you have forgotten occasion where exactly the photo was taken , you can click with a click a browser which shows the area . if you want to post a postcard to another &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; user may want to locate the place of the photo , it is good the position of the photo information of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data comes into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 contains many GPS dat@@ e@@ fields such as direction , saddle and card refer@@ encing . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly using the right hardware , through a post@@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module ( manual ) and finally about the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receiver . either as a ticket module , or through transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS @-@ Interface : Co@@ y@@ Ashley@@ Eye I@@ pa@@ q I@@ ke K@@ od@@ ak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR ri@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be loaded with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you need to store this data in the g@@ px format , as this is the only format that is supported by the module to the geographical assignment .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract data from images and GPS and cor@@ relate it . on the following page you can display the same under &amp; Linux ; : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itu@@ dinal or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the hall@@ mark Co@@ ordin@@ ate coordinates , which are created for instance by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ r.l. shows no European roads . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; try to give as much control over his work processes as possible . there are many settings to access the behavior of &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; change to those settings . you can switch from Sett@@ ings menu . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side .

this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copy@@ righ@@ ted data . these data are automatically selected to the corresponding IP@@ TC data inser@@ tion . also , when downloading the IP@@ TC fields , this data is also written in the IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ort@@ it@@ el is a syn@@ onym for authors . this field should include the professional design@@ ation of the photographer . this field should be the design@@ ation of a photographer , fre@@ el@@ ance photographer or independent , commer@@ cially photographer . as this is a detailed description of the author , this field must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author , if this is a record company , such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group or the Agency will be available for the image here .
the IP@@ TC actions can store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this allows moisture to permanently contain in the picture and not only came into the database of &amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; these met@@ adata are also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; it will be imported .
image editing as contained in JPEG imag@@ ery ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your photos with which in the pictures contained in the pictures . thus , your circum@@ cis@@ ings may also be read by other images , these are written by those of the di@@ gi@@ val ; over@@ written .
the page settings contains all options for the information that appear when mouse @-@ cur@@ sor over a file rests on a file . according to the chosen option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; di@@ gi@@ fted ; supports a number of different image formats , and some video formats and audio formats . to specify which data types &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; to indicate , you can add to the file extension of this list ; Alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner , who has no one of these extensions , from &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by press the button Re@@ fresh right from each category .
the settings of the illumin@@ ated by &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; can be set on this page on the default ones . however , some pictures do not have different sizes and the syn@@ ch@@ ron mode is then not available . however , the option &amp; quot ; In all the image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; should you only use quick b@@ ills . if you have one , then you can obtain better results .
by default , the image editing a black background behind the indicated photos . if you prefer a different color , you can switch this here . you can switch the tool@@ bar off if you use the tool@@ bar in the full screen mode .
over and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dar@@ ker or light colour in the picture . these colours will be specified here . in the picture editing , this View Mode can be swit@@ ched with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and turned off .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sam@@ pling is meant that the images are co@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in color information . please refer to this article in Wikipedia to the near@@ er explanation .
with setting PNG comp@@ ression you can reduce the size of PNG files . this surgery is not reducing the image quality , because PNG creates a ver@@ sive algorith@@ m . the only effect is that the image data put more time to execute and pack abs . if you have a quick calcul@@ ator , you can put this value on a high comp@@ ression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high comp@@ ression .
with the option TI@@ FF files comp@@ ress you can turn the de@@ fl@@ ate -@@ comp@@ ression sal@@ ary mus for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality because the de@@ fl@@ ate -@@ algorith@@ m is dis@@ able .
with the setting @-@ free JPEG @-@ 2000 files you can put the los@@ sy @-@ free track . even if you select the los@@ sy @-@ pleas@@ er adjustment , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with the normal JPEG . when this paragraph has not yet been supported , but was still in the planning stage .
in the previous versions of &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam , the picture editing only one picture concerned for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to become a tool for the mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing .
the default percentage is that all green pixels are the same . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option makes the image a little soft , elimin@@ ating however the 2x@@ 2 Git@@ ter@@ patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD @-@ quality method .
when this option is set , the whit@@ eboard used the camera will be used . otherwise , if put , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the whit@@ ish is not set off . standard is it a fixed color balance , which was photograph@@ ed on a white map that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps more details in the nickname . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is it the ox@@ idi@@ zed , so the parts of your images are burned down , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to view the top @-@ re@@ mixed results , because it shows the setting @-@ up in various ro@@ at@@ ti@@ sts . finally , you can try to re@@ construct several parts of the missing information from the top @-@ edge technology .
this is possible because blue pixels in general is not as fast s@@ ati@@ ous as green and red . and d@@ cra@@ b are trying to re@@ construct the missing green and red files from the not saturated blue pixel . of course , this is a matter how much paint or wh@@ ites you want .
if you select the option re@@ construct , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each image individually .
put the L@@ umin@@ ary value to your li@@ king . you probably need to put it slightly higher than standard 1 . this can also be made later in the image options of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; image processing will be made . to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should be conservative .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing -@@ algorith@@ m is a digital image process to get a complete picture out of the part @-@ related image sensor that provides lots of cameras and which makes a matrix colour@@ ful pixel . this algorith@@ m is also known as C@@ FA @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ konstru@@ ktion .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; and D@@ cra@@ b provide you with three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorith@@ m that was used by D@@ cra@@ b . but it is the first algorith@@ m that was used by D@@ cra@@ b . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you &apos;re looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can put the red and blue @-@ proof values here . this is certainly the best method for a period of different type , since you will be converted during the resource conver@@ ge .
a profile translate the Far@@ bin@@ ations and gives instructions on how this should be returned . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; information like the far@@ bin@@ ations of a color tree in the others are so accurately as possible .
behaviour questions , if an image is opened in the editing process / colour module , with raw files .
in the folder folder , fill in the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; examine this folder during the starts .
setting of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; default squ@@ at ; for your profiles to be saved . everything can be changed while opening the pipe @-@ file later .
the color @-@ view view is an alternative towards X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here are just your pictures and manages not the whole screen .
the input profiles should be used to the camera body and model that you use . not all profiles are created on the same type . there are some , such as Canon , which do not have color ton@@ mapping or flame ret@@ ard@@ less . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma is not required for con@@ versions at 16 bit depths . this means that you have to carry the color ton@@ mapping itself .
there are other options like this soft @-@ proof profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how to print your image from a device . this is very useful before you print your printer , as your printer has a smaller color area as your camera and some colors will therefore be very saturated . this could you manually correct rather than rely on the flas@@ hing algorith@@ m of your printer .
for most cameras it is pretty obvious that color profile is intended for them for what is provided . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here follows a table of cameras and prof@@ iling behind them . this answer is of course un@@ official :
the Canon extension extended the style for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neutr@@ al , P for portra@@ its and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . it is an interface , which is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image concerned and imag@@ inations ; many modules support that were written to work with any program , which supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules that you want to use , and these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
sty@@ ling for tasks that can be carried out by modules can be set in the menu under Sett@@ lements .
more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I @-@ Module you can get over the K@@ IP@@ I project by ht@@ tp : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ged .org or in the Manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I module .
the settings of the slideshow should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ator just@@ iert the time between the cap@@ tions , usually there are 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other cross@@ roads turn off the met@@ adata that are built at the lower end of the images during the display .
the camera features present on the left side a list of all the time supported cameras . on the right side above there is a button automatic detection , which is trying to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , it is swit@@ ched on , swit@@ ched and in the photo mode . currently , here are Seri@@ elle , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage devices .
at the bottom of the end you can use the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage boxes selected from the cam@@ ali@@ ste . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / re@@ produce , specify on which you attach your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ era ; to use , you have to connect the camera with your computer , put them into the display mode and switch off .
try out if &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set up cam@@ er@@ od@@ ell and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera .
you can select any given name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option Con@@ vert@@ dialog for re@@ loc@@ ating &gt; images in the tr@@ ash log , you can adjust the conversation of &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; when del@@ eting some photos in an album . in the sections of a photo and del@@ eting of an album you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ kl@@ ed by &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; used , if you use the option changes in the right side bar without asking questions . otherwise , you need to apply the changes to the button below .
you can also tie the ad of the initial re@@ boot of &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam , while star@@ ving . this speeds up under certain circumstances the starting work of &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; .
the h@@ iring Bei@@ m begins for new photos to look for &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; the base folder after new or sol@@ dered albums / photos . this extends the start @-@ time of &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; . if something came out of the base folder , asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; you , if it is supposed to delete them from the database .
different shades can be in &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; used to custom@@ ize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected among settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be shown below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; to create , you will find more information about this tutorial .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; includes a quick image editing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and improve the correction and improvement . the picture editing can be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the previous ads .
the editing tool contains a number of tools to enhance your images . so some of them are available as modules into &amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; therefore , you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you can find in the section editing .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ ename , current file number , magni@@ fier factor and the current image size indicates .
a menu bar at the top and including the tool@@ bar to provide quick access to the most frequently used functions .
the editing functions of the picture editing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file stor@@ ing or the button save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
so you should possibly create a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with file stor@@ ing as well .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Format or use the button &apos; Rest@@ ore &quot; Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar , you will then lose any change that you have carried out in the photo since the last time .
virtually any action of the picture editing may be revers@@ ed or recovered . the last action you can turn back , by stopping Be@@ am re@@ ver@@ ted or restored by choosing the Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should make yourself the short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to turn back and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to re@@ produce .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; on the back @-@ back button in the tool@@ bar to press a moment longer , you get a cont@@ ext@@ menu . if you select one of the menus , all actions in between also be revers@@ ed or recovered .
once you have launched the editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same point by using the navigation buttons , image high , image r@@ under or the entries in the menu file . if you want to make changes in the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save it .
you can go in the photograph in the photograph , in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar , or the entries in the box menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar to choose the enlargement factor automatically .
view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come into the normal view where you can use the Es@@ c button . usually , you can change this in the intro@@ duc@@ ting dialog by &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; change this window from the window . see this section to set up the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the image file and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; push dialog . you can adjust the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole phr@@ ases . whole images can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the pictures with the default methods and select from the menu album , when you follow the assistant , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides important information and promotions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available , without the navig@@ ational games , also available in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders are listed :
extra @-@ cre@@ ek clicking on the same rider leaves the side@@ bar to appear and disappear into the edge .
in the description , you can input or insert circum@@ cis@@ ions with unlimited size or insert . please note the note below . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . that means that all the special characters are allowed . the circum@@ cis@@ ings are copied in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only supports AS@@ C@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are illustrated according to 2000 characters and special features are formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC prot@@ ru@@ ding field in other applications , you should notice these restrictions .
after which you have commented , use either the button or simply switch to the next picture , the indic@@ t@@ ations will then be saved .
besides the use @-@ button there is a button More . with this you can write other met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the met@@ adata into the files . however , this will always be done if you have selected a met@@ adata setting , which is always written into the pictures .
the section evaluation displays a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and coll@@ ation . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut . in order to evaluate several images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the co@@ ding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
the keywords , shows a sear@@ cher to the filter parameters , the keywords , and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; -@@ session comp@@ atri@@ ates key@@ word .
the keywords will be adapted dynam@@ ically to the one @-@ given search tool . you can easily restrict the number of ways in finding a keywords . this ability is especially useful if you have a lot of keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another facil@@ itation in entering sam@@ pling , in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed various keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be placed through mark@@ er of the respective cross@@ roads in the tree . all the cat@@ ch@@ words of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if multiple images are selected in the top view and select a key@@ word in the keywords , this will only be applied to the whole selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keywords , please read the keywords filter version .
the side@@ bar key@@ b filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keywords , and search engines . if in addition one or more key@@ b filter appears from the right side , only the cutting quantity of these two is displayed . all keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop . suppose you have selected in the main view several images to provide you with keywords . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and attach to the selection . as a result , a dialog , which you asks if you want to put the keywords .
in the top example shows the main window frames displayed on a cal@@ ender date . the keywords will be selected , with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and after that a key@@ word was drawn from the right key@@ tree to the selection and pic@@ tured there . a dialogue asks if this keywords shall be set .
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . you can also be swit@@ ched under Sett@@ ings .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or its needs , you can easily change it with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry to be sought after in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database .
for example , you can set up a Advanced search of all the elements of the database with the following options :
when you want to group options , you only need the cable field at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options see then as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and Flick@@ r not listed ? the free space site is there for 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in the full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly worked on &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation was adapted .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed work@@ flow using the colours available from your camera or scanner , you can easily get photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed work@@ flow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor those from your camera or scanner , and that the colors you print or purchased in the web which suit you from your digital dark room .
when the topic is coming in color administration , everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , the meaning of this tut@@ orials is to provide you with adequate background information about colour management . additionally , you will find links with deeper information allowing your own informal decisions to make you get the desired result .
if your work@@ flow meets all the criteria listed below , you do not have to worry about color administration .
you are working on a monitor based on the R@@ GB mode type . ( further information can be found below )
your only other images include by email or the web , where s@@ R@@ GB of the de @-@ facto standard is .
so when s@@ R@@ GB does so well and life for all so easy , why should one use another color tree and thus to worry about color @-@ wr@@ inkl@@ es ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compar@@ ing to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colours we can see , the hu@@ gely @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB color tree , the tri@@ ang@@ ular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimension@@ ing representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger color spaces , then visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om excell@@ ente site and then click on Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to display my monitor if I decided to work only in the R@@ GB colour foam ?
yes ! whether you are working in the R@@ GB colour or not , you need to display your monitor , since R@@ GB does not include your monitor player on s@@ R@@ GB mode . if you are working as in the color tree of s@@ R@@ GB , you need to either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool expos@@ es five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve an image in most cases . use it before you try further reducing manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , altern@@ ate , automatic and contrast from the menu of corrected automatic correction automatically try to make the best . you will need to experiment with these effects , to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ aire @-@ rise above the entire picture , so that the dark point black and the ligh@@ test point will change as bright as possible without its grad@@ ations to change . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed .
ab@@ same : this method adjusted the ligh@@ test method of the colors of the selected picture , so that the hist@@ o@@ grams of the intensity is as flat as possible . sometimes it achiev@@ es very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produced just ru@@ bb@@ ish . it is a very powerful surgery which causes either wonders in an image or it destroyed it .
automatic cleaning : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue @-@ channel . it controls the dark and bright border @-@ tones and adjusted the red , green and blue @-@ channels on the whole hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ es area .
double @-@ contrast : this method improves the contrast and light of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible area and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in mature images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the whit@@ ish of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ons ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool in order to perform the white mar@@ mot@@ ions of a photo .
the white straight @-@ correction is somewhat limited since about a color tree with 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you can practice it too far from the original image . if you can perform the white straight in the gray mode , which in the 16 @-@ bit mode works , so your possibilities will be considered better .
this tool is based on a white archipelago of the copy@@ righ@@ ted by Paw@@ el T. Zy@@ ym . you start it via the menu bar color white straight from the image processing .
the window display can be adjusted in size . on the left side are both the original image and the preview of the target picture . the preview is adapted dynam@@ ically to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white straight away , then it dates back to the window .
the preview of the target picture features a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ anz of the Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is displayed as ver@@ bal line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m .
right upstairs is a hist@@ o@@ grams appears that as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ o@@ grams is very helpful , even in well illumin@@ ated images , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ ous values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz .
the contrast of your outcome depends on shadows , s@@ ati@@ ation and g@@ amma @-@ g@@ ging . the shadow of adjust@@ ing lets you improve the shadow side of your photos or di@@ mming .
An@@ stat with the above mentioned checks should be applied , you should use the color temperature pist@@ on . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color temperature of the white colour . this way the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white @-@ off with the list of preference . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposed indicators increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixels is over@@ exposed . it will display the combined result in the white cover . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
the buttons as well as loading make exactly this . any setting of the white comparison you can set can save it into a text file and then load later .
the button pres@@ ets set all the filter values once again on its default values and the corresponding neutr@@ ality rate . keep in mind that the appropriate settings may be added to another photo than your original . if you save it , your original image will be modified .
you can set the co@@ ding element per color @-@ channel of the be@@ written image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is the widely spread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better for high quality pictures . these enco@@ ding is also needed for high @-@ quality co@@ ding time and stands out to the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialogue as for the processing of blan@@ ks . it uses the change and the al@@ location of paint profiles . colours can be carried out by the sub@@ window for the bri@@ ghtness . a det@@ a@@ illed manual for the use of color profiles , you can draw the chapter Col@@ im@@ alt at rate .
another key tool is available in the menu below colors . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust to multiple color channels , so that you can always use it for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always take the same mistakes and you can therefore always find the same correction . in the hand@@ book , you will find more information .
to rec@@ ti@@ fy a very powerful possibility of assi@@ mil@@ ation problems is the tool that you &apos;ll find in the colors of Grad@@ ation in the menu .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted effect provides four color effects , a solar power calcul@@ ates , a cycle effect , a ne@@ on effect and a ch@@ u@@ der filter available .
in times of chemical manufacturing , solar panels , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect of the image evolved . the colored , dar@@ ker areas protected the delicate areas dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting result . the result was a part negative of the picture . this tool permits you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controlled the solar energy . at about 50 % intensity the image is what chem@@ ically possible is . an additional increase finally generates a negative image that so does not produce on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of solar power . the original one is the ( 1 ) and the one the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vivi@@ d @-@ filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it diff@@ ers from a s@@ ati@@ ation that he does a stronger contra@@ sting effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , it emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the flag@@ ship produced by the Japanese company F@@ UJ@@ IF@@ IL@@ M . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for his smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color during day@@ light and high contra@@ sts . the characteristics they make him the film of choice for nature fot@@ ograph@@ s . Vel@@ via is strong complex colors , but also some photographs , specifically those who are barely ins@@ ure , too much .
the ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ sts . the parameter level controls the bri@@ ghtness of the result and the fe@@ ver re@@ ps the strength of the ne@@ on . at large pictures the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the color shades and the ligh@@ test of the photos . you can preview the various colour bas@@ ins of your photos with the tools in the menu below colors . once you are happy with the result you use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo with bad light conditions , you can easily get the reverse problem : one too big s@@ ati@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for bri@@ ghtness / satur@@ ation may simply reduce it . all changes you can perform in preview . if Him like the result , you can confirm the changes made with O@@ k .
among the complex tool Grad@@ ation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ strength / contrast / Gamma is the tool tone correction to improve the exposure . even if the dialog is too complicated for this tool , you need only the area of sli@@ der . concrete the three sli@@ der below the hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ s .
the window provides a graph@@ s of the Int@@ ensity values , a hist@@ o@@ grams , of active can@@ als or of the selected area . under the graph@@ s are three sli@@ ders to change in , and the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn how to use is to move the controller and take care of how the image changes .
on the right can be seen the original and preview of the picture . the preview is dynamic , updated with the settings of the image , updated . on the left hand side are the following options available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted if the hist@@ o@@ grams is shown with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . in pictures the large areas of a constant color includes the linear hist@@ o@@ grams of a single pillar is dominated by a single column . in this case , the logical story of a single column is beneficial .
three shelves : the upper@@ most for the dark T@@ ones , the middle for the light tones and the lower for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ble @-@ values .
the three color @-@ pin@@ ets can be used in the original image of the original image , to adjust the inputs of the shade , middle and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a kno@@ b for a fully automatic alignment .
output values : allow the output values allowing the selection of manual values for each field . there are also two Reg@@ ler that can be used to change the output levels as with the input values , for example , to create a hidden image as a background to see while something else is in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the picture .
save as and store : with these buttons , the missing values can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later re@@ loaded . this will be used on Gimp levels .
if you use this mode and the three shades , the input @-@ read@@ ings will be automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun@@ shades . tick the color image which you want to use and click on the original image of the hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ s for rotation , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ channels .
the option over@@ exposed indic@@ t@@ ator controls all shades and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect in the final result .
below you can see an example of the alignment of the input levels applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half the original is displayed and the target picture is displayed dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right hand side are the following options available :
modifications : this selection box allows the channel to specify the channel changed by the module :
besides this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures that have been included with a digital camera . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , linear mode creates a broad panel . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will continue .
if you move e.g. a student rope to the right , for example , the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds with a dar@@ ker out@@ for@@ s corresponding and that the associated image are dar@@ ker .
the preview of its original photos is to see a red mark@@ er . if you want to change this mark@@ er on the area you want to change , a suitable line on the curve is displayed , which represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it down and down , down to your taste .
save as and store : these buttons can make you exactly this . each bend that you may have generated can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and later be loaded . the file format is the Gimp Kur@@ dish format .
if you are using this method and the three shades of the curve are automatically created the control points of the curve for all channels of the barrier , middle and solar tones . activate the color @-@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kur@@ ve .
the option over@@ exposed indic@@ t@@ ator controls all color channels to display over @-@ coated pixel . if in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect in the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ white photo , which was corrected in L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kan@@ al . shadow and sun @-@ sounds was set with the color p@@ ette and applied to the cur@@ ves . the original one is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel @-@ Mix@@ er of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ dy@@ er ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color grad@@ ations of the photos .
the channel @-@ Mix@@ er is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colours channel mix@@ er of the image processing .
with the Kan@@ al@@ op@@ tionally , you can select the color for the Hist@@ ogra@@ m : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to the own riders .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m is shown to show you the appropriate colour .
the controls for the module are right below : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction will enable you to mix these channels . if you can also enable the appropriate dose components , as the channel mix@@ er will then DAS to the creation of great black @-@ white con@@ versions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ white portrait .
sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , which comes the reduction of color to a visible tow@@ el that comes from far@@ es . Far@@ bre@@ wers consists of small spac@@ ing facts . if that is the case , you can improve your Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me conversion to improve in which you first reduce the color scheme .
the sali@@ va as and loading buttons are used exactly to this for purposes . any Mix@@ er attitude allows you to save it later and then load . the used file format is the Gimp @-@ portrait format .
the option over@@ exposed indic@@ t@@ ator controls all shades and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect in the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re@@ comp@@ elled . the option L@@ umin@@ anz is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of the digital photographs , black / white is a working step , because shades can be easily converted to the machine . also with a set of film profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulated a black / white fil@@ ament with a green lin@@ sen@@ filter . this looks good , with all the scenarios and fits particularly well with portra@@ its against the sky . thus , much like the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter : sim@@ ulated a black / white fil@@ ament with a orange lin@@ sen@@ filter . this increases landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so much like the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter .
Rot@@ filter : sim@@ ulated a black / white fil@@ tering version with a red lin@@ sen@@ filter . this creates dramatic art effects and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ ch@@ time reaction to the time period . so much like the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulated a black / white fil@@ ename with a yellow lin@@ sen@@ filter . this is the most natural color ton@@ per@@ sever@@ ance and enh@@ ances the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Gel@@ b@@ filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm bright and medium tones . this is very similar to the process of running a printing and the re @-@ development in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , whether it is a color picture or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , the p@@ inch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or just like a wall picture on a wall . the sample variations in the image processing can be used for this purpose .
relief : to move this parameter to the right raises the emb@@ lance of depth and do@@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text def@@ ect has been applied to the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter Rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to a picture .
keep the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to put the image to a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the stream eye . under picture frame it can be started from the editing .
type : with this parameter you set the cart type for your image . thoroughly close the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce shi@@ fted it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , se@@ du@@ et it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame is ideal for a button @-@ effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with designs .
width : returns the width of the frame in percent . the value area for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
the picture set with the frame is bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio is . this is important for the pressure of the images , especially if you have used the tool to cut beforehand .
with this practical tool , you can insert single form@@ att@@ ed text into an image of any one place . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to user . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text guide , orientation , color out of the color tree and character set with its features like you . you will simply select a frame round the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting that you chose for your text can be changed until you press button OK . once the image is stored once , the text part of the picture . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; tool to apply a template that you put an impression on an image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; picture 1 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu of the image processing can be used in order to put an image . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to add the PNG transparent format . if you want to add your template ( 9 ) to the reduction in the file size . if you want to add your 1 e @-@ mail to the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ft@@ ist ; mail@@ ing@@ list di@@ gi@@ l @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your sten@@ cil folder with the button base folder . select the folder in which you have copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings are marked for the next start .
having set the root folder for the Stencils , appears a belly @-@ view that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder , and the selection of a folder is updated the pres@@ sp@@ ar of the templates .
below you can find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fier factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this kno@@ b @-@ sto@@ cked the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse kno@@ b .
smaller : this kno@@ b smaller the underlying picture . it is centered to the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the entire picture , you must decrease the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse kno@@ b .
move this button to move the below to the template . take the picture and place it at the desired location .
use OK if you want to apply the template into your image . the image will then be adapted automatically to preview size .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; makes three different tools available for gr@@ inding . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shooting . it is very fast and simple , but created especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined pictures .
un@@ p@@ ness mask is working on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ pen@@ ed . in fact , it works rather psych@@ ov@@ is@@ ual . you can use it to atmosph@@ eric Dun@@ st and it &apos;s doing here a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken out of Gimp and it &apos;s copy@@ righ@@ ted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
Ref@@ ec@@ ussi@@ es may possibly be the best of three as it really enh@@ ances the shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ ised images require correction of shar@@ p@@ ness . this is the smaller one that is smaller than the dis@@ solution will therefore be somewhat bl@@ ur@@ red . the same phenomenon can observe if color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually need more det@@ ox shar@@ pen@@ ing as normal cameras for the private user .
with JPEG @-@ images it is often applied to a camera internal tu@@ bing . images in raw format , on the contrary , must always be pen@@ ed during treatment .
some sc@@ ann@@ ers use a pair of sc@@ ary already during the reading of the image . if you activate this de@@ activate , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by boo@@ sting a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing def@@ enders . you can call you with the sample @-@ in error corrected .
you should hereby b@@ ap@@ y with caution because the outcomes are not very natural - the shar@@ pen@@ ing increases the shar@@ p@@ ness of the edges , but also boo@@ sts the noise . in general , the viable technique for correc@@ ting chor@@ ages . you can reach it about the sample in the chor@@ age of chor@@ ages . under Ref@@ ec@@ ussi@@ an image you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for shooting .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : an image is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to record the picture a little soft , is much easier than it shar@@ per . use the tool to get soft@@ ening with the menu item , and experiment with something with settings . the occurrence of window on the right side of the dialogue will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help you edit the image . window display shows the output of the fil@@ tering with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values produce frequently good results and should first try out . an increase in the radius or the amount rein@@ forcing the effect . if you can make the shar@@ p@@ ness mask , get caught and produce the impression of gr@@ ats within close proximity of sharp edges .
the radius displays a how many pixels are affected by the filter by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ os . you should therefore raise pictures of the best in its final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the bl@@ ur@@ ned picture which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the shar@@ p@@ ness is set .
the Corpor@@ a wert is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the applicable differ@@ ential amount . in this way , areas will be applied to a soft change between the killing of shar@@ pen@@ ing and hence f@@ law in faces , cel@@ est@@ ial and aqu@@ atic surfaces .
this is an example of un@@ sharp filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image is ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red has been used with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a s@@ ell@@ chec@@ ker = 0.0 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; tool ref@@ ussi@@ on@@ ging ref@@ ussi@@ on@@ ates a picture by improving the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted un@@ protected fil@@ m algorith@@ m by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries on an image to &amp; quot ; ref@@ ok@@ ussi@@ an quot ; in which it makes the defensive work re@@ versible . it makes use of a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for the shooting of images is the use of a shar@@ p@@ ness mask . you can start it from the menu by calling the ref@@ lex@@ icon in picture editing .
in practice the circular wr@@ aps works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which leads to the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen F@@ altung is even influenced in most cases even very strongly from the remote pixels . it causes unwanted results .
circular shar@@ pen@@ ing : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the key parameters for the use of this module . for most pictures the default value should result in 1 good results . you can put a higher value when your image is very bl@@ ur@@ red , but then at Heiligen@@ sch@@ eine .
cor@@ relation : an increase in the cor@@ relation can help decrease arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.95 and upwards . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ p@@ ending effect of the module .
smok@@ sh@@ filter : an increase in the cat@@ ch@@ filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 only rarely . if the spac@@ es@@ filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor . a consumer value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value gets the image more poll@@ uted .
Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche Sch@@ är@@ fe : this is the radius causes the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche Sch@@ är@@ fe . this parameter is most commonly caused by a previously un@@ p@@ red@@ ness filter . in most cases , you should avoid this value on 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal zero , so you may also have to increase the cor@@ relation and / or the h@@ edge filter .
matri@@ xes : this value determines the size of the transform@@ ation@@ sm@@ atri@@ x . increasing the die size can produce good results especially if you choose big values for the circular shar@@ pen@@ ing or Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen shar@@ p@@ ness . however , that the module is very slow if you choose great value for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the sali@@ va as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any chor@@ ages parameters that you have set is thus saved for later and can then be loaded .
try all the cutting , color and vo@@ icing activities on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image before you change the image . the reason for this is that many operations changes not immediately visible are not immediately visible , but left intact art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you browse photos and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ comp@@ ressed image .
generally , bl@@ ur@@ red mask provides better results as a shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ red masks a bigger neighborhood used as a shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theoretically , it must be bl@@ ur@@ red , always remove arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the intoler@@ ance . for the Vienna filter one can show that there is the optimal ruler of the fil@@ tering effect . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is almost just as good as the intoler@@ ance . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is frequently better in treating small details .
below you can see a comparison between different filters on a small un@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed image :
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected . this picture was made with a an@@ alo@@ on camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto @-@ focus Lin@@ se attri@@ but@@ able .
for more information on the methods of raising correction , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the Reg@@ ler Gl@@ ät@@ te continues the bl@@ ur@@ red@@ ness of the area of the dark dark and thereby generate a natural p@@ inch .
the color @-@ tin@@ te allows a adapted color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools in order to remove the requested arti@@ facts with an unprecedented speed .
the incorpor@@ ating algorith@@ m was developed by I@@ MAGE Team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are below :
if you want to create the fil@@ tering orders you can use the rider smooth@@ ing and advanced settings .
Detailed stop@@ over &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an equ@@ ili@@ ary about the image . Wo@@ unded bigger values mainly homogen@@ eous regions gl@@ uten and details is un@@ sharp . please note that no shar@@ pen@@ ing should be det@@ ained or requested . please note that the ad@@ diction always should be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
approxim@@ ation ad@@ diction alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ ed even@@ ly in all directions , while a value close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film clip or CCD spac@@ ing will produce a high level wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best at a value close to 1 .
smooth@@ ing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all else@@ . then , then , the relative gl@@ ati@@ fication . place this value accordingly to the level of smoking in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set . this is necessary , when a lot of noise is pre@@ dominant , since it is difficult to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect he must be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : returns how often the algorith@@ m is continuously going through . usually there is 1 or 2 out .
ang@@ ular wide da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : Angl@@ ed integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small , it should also be small in order to generate a long running time . so you should select this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral St@@ range &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integr@@ ative start @-@ up in pixels . you should put the value smaller 1 to avoid Sub @-@ Pixel smooth@@ ing and never bigger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More about quality that you receive by selection of this option is only small . however , it dou@@ bles its duration . we therefore recommend it .
the buttons as and loading make exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and later be loaded back again .
correct error correct is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a long time and a high CPU load to pull out . you can therefore cancel calculation at any time with the kno@@ ck@@ off .
below you can see how graphical errors have been corrected with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module will be made on a photo that is made in Guatemala City with an an@@ alo@@ gen camera , applied . as you can see there &apos;s a pecu@@ liar art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground , that is caused by a bad film storage during the trip . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; lo@@ wer@@ reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease images . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorith@@ m by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
this tool expos@@ es sel@@ ectable image filter to remove spots and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sens@@ ory from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on sens@@ ory of digital cameras , so you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screens@@ hot above shows a typical scene which has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ary room that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings may remain in default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel and can modify the image . the area moving through the image and the color in it will be smo@@ unted and therefore minor errors .
shar@@ p@@ ness : controls the pix@@ el@@ f@@ ep@@ e@@ gel . this value expos@@ es the pix@@ el@@ am filter to look ligh@@ ten . if you are raised the edges of the filter , if you change this setting . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter images can no longer be obtained and smoking , or lubric@@ ate occurs once more .
edges : controls the ch@@ imp@@ rec@@ ision for the shar@@ p@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response to the filter . if it is too severe not the entire noise can be removed or rou@@ gh@@ e@@ es can occur . put it on a value close to the maximum , if you want to remove a f@@ aint or JPEG @-@ arti@@ facts without details .
ligh@@ density : controls the lumin@@ ance intoler@@ ance of the image . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to change an image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color @-@ toler@@ ances of the image . we recommend you either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically more bol@@ ted , to increase . however , it is also the shadow ranges .
absorption : controls the alignment of the Ph@@ as@@ en@@ voy . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius is re@@ acted . if it is increasing , the edges may occur . if it is too high , noise and ph@@ em@@ en@@ j@@ itter can occur in the edges . it can remove tips and is the recommended method for it .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the lo@@ resc@@ ission reduction you have set , can be saved to the fil@@ esystem and later loaded .
this is an example of how the reduction of your life may change . the original one is with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the reduction has been applied to the default settings .
sometimes an image is naked for your purpose . the solution to record the picture is a little soft , fortunately many simpler than one image to def@@ use . use to add a tool to the soft@@ sig@@ nia with the sample entry , and experiment with the bul@@ b . the window display on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ dy@@ ed ; photo Rest@@ oration is definitely one of the most developed tools to decrease photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter to Restau@@ ration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to emerge around Gau@@ ß &apos; stag , film liqu@@ ors , scr@@ at@@ ches , comp@@ ression mode and local mistakes that arise in digital , original or later digit@@ ised photographs , and thus gets the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorith@@ m can be used for color and text @-@ composition . the text setting is performed with another tool , the photo error corrected , performed . the algorith@@ m for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE Team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG type : the comp@@ ression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a ver@@ sive comp@@ ression circuit , he creates some comp@@ ression &amp; quot ; Art@@ em@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ comp@@ ressed image . this setting should be correct .
the buttons as and loading make exactly this . every setting of photo Rest@@ oration can be saved into a text file and will be loaded again later .
photo Rest@@ oration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load to move after . you can therefore cancel calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
below you can reduce like a photo with like @-@ off smok@@ es , .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a mini camera ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a Sens@@ iti@@ vity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film bas@@ kets in the faces . the original one is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures has been reduced to an old color foto , which was used with a scanner . you can see the scan species displayed by the sc@@ ann@@ ers and the photo paper . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; tool altern@@ ate allows sound of photos that have been using a CCD camera to remove . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PEG@@ Pix@@ i project , protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly in high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos a problem because many cameras with JPEG comp@@ ression over a built @-@ in oppression of hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; name pix@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ quot ; to remove a photo with a dark @-@ image sub@@ method method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file into the wi@@ z@@ ard . the tool will detect automatic the hot and bright pixels . these are acc@@ entu@@ ated in the picture preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can start the dark picture directly at the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in previous section , you should load the matching dark picture to the correc@@ tive image . please note that the wi@@ z@@ ard will notice the last dark picture and this automatically load it in the next session .
the image area and the preview will help you to correct the outcome . the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels have taken up in all educational areas .
select an area to see the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ l this pix@@ blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ an : it will select an average of the neighbour@@ hoods . the resulting color is assigned to all broken pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional interval , this will be made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels pick a distance from 1 of the pix@@ el@@ pack , are being drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear cur@@ ves ( 2 @-@ DIM ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DIM ) . these are then used to cross the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default method method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less of the pix@@ el@@ base are set out to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ DIM ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DIM ) , which is then used to cross the pixels in the block .
Cub@@ an : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be pulled to calculate a bi @-@ cu@@ bic surface ( 2 @-@ DIM ) or a group of cu@@ bic cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DIM ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ line correction on a color photo , of a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , which can be seen . the original image was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; Vign@@ et@@ tier@@ or@@ re@@ ktion is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. sub@@ li@@ fied corners , an image to correct .
expan@@ sive lenses , especially the medium and large photo @-@ format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) it reaches the corners and edges of the image by bringing the light to the sensor there . Tele@@ lenses show that may also act like this .
but it also has draw@@ backs . many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 by the aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . cra@@ ving objective , even with center filter , an opening up of f / 16 or less , as otherwise inv@@ ective effects emerge through motion .
with the large exposure of today &apos;s fil@@ tration and color , or grey stu@@ ds of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a c@@ enter@@ filter that is made without this filter , which is applied without a c@@ enter@@ filter on a picture . the algorith@@ m is copy@@ righ@@ ted by John Walker .
with three shelves you can control the vig@@ il@@ isation process and with three further the expos@@ ing of the target balance .
density : these parameters controlled the degree of light absorption on the point of the largest density that Fil@@ ters . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , resulting in an optical filter with a bl@@ ending radius of 1 , or by chance of a light intensity of 2 , ent@@ ru@@ pt@@ .@@ enhance the density to compens@@ ate for a larger degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to a small degree .
lights , contra@@ sts and g@@ amma @-@ settings : the fertili@@ zation of an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting of the pixels . you have to re@@ locate the exposure of the target image with these options . the regul@@ ator will only provide you with positive values because you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fine new just@@ ment of the target balance , let the values for illumin@@ ants / doub@@ ast / Gamma at zero and use the Grad@@ ation from the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; image processing from the menu color Grad@@ ation .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting process to an image applied . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the labels in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a lamp mod@@ elling and contrast @-@ correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; Lin@@ sen@@ dist@@ or@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorith@@ m by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tions . color@@ fully dist@@ or@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second Gr@@ ades treated the general geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tion of the lens , and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ cre@@ atic form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third Gr@@ ades has a similar run effect , but fla@@ cht to the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth Gr@@ ades corrected the distant Cor@@ ners and set it to the second c@@ ades . if you combine these two can combine any geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tion nearly eliminated .
bro@@ adly : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion of the second Gr@@ ades . with negative values they can be corrected or negative values and con@@ scientious obj@@ ection .
corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion fourth Gr@@ ades . this value works more strongly in the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Little parameters has the reverse sign of the parameter General .
Zoom : this value scale the image size new and thus leads to a correction of the first Gr@@ ades through . negative values enlarge while positive the image decreased .
bright : this value just@@ iert the bri@@ ghtness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the bri@@ ghtness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialogue with a preview the dist@@ or@@ isation process . the values that you use for your image will be stored and used at the next start as default .
the tonn@@ ell@@ - or ver@@ tically correction should be done before all supplies or Siz@@ es . best to cut this correction than all first through . if you make a picture new to cut and then make a tonn@@ ell@@ ar correction , the effect would be obvious to fal@@ low .
to help you find the best correction to you , this tool displays a vertical and horizontal aid line . move it to an important place , like example of the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can fix the tonn@@ - / k@@ rid@@ ors dist@@ or@@ tion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a k@@ ite @-@ shaped dist@@ or@@ tion , the resulting picture black no@@ oks . you can transform them with the cutting instrument in the menu , cutting from the image processing or on the Zoom rule of this dialog .
for most pictures , the tons @-@ like correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some motives , e.g. photographs from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture is 90 degrees . please note that if you hold the camera with your hand , you will always have an easy dist@@ or@@ tion of the perspective .
this is an example of tons @-@ like correction to a church in Norway . the original one is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
the algorith@@ m is based on a method for sim@@ ulating infr@@ a @-@ film web site which is accessible by the URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a film , see this URL . this film has a sensation range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectang@@ le with the mouse you can move the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview , you can set two parameters , set @-@ grain and film sens@@ itiveness ( ISO ) . activate the optional texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO @-@ regul@@ ator changes the amount of the film bas@@ kets and domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter color channels to re@@ produce infr@@ ared @-@ film , especially the Grün@@ kan@@ al makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the color @-@ form@@ ations are missing .
this is an example of infr@@ ared @-@ fil@@ me@@ ek@@ tes applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of au@@ ra in the top @-@ light .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; filter film bas@@ kets is an easy to use tool to re@@ produce film bas@@ kets in your paintings . it is known from classical high @-@ speed movies as for example the B / W K@@ od@@ ak Tri @-@ X , known for sensitivity of the movies , the manufacturers of large silver gran@@ ders of the photo em@@ ul@@ sion .
the film @-@ brac@@ ing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move into the past . it gets a tim@@ eless atmosphere released from day @-@ to @-@ day life . if you want this special , Gallery @-@ like , rhin@@ oc@@ graphic , gra@@ ined sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , so you have to use this filter .
with the regul@@ ator , the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be adjusted to the control of the intensity and degree of gran@@ ul@@ arity . the default value is , although often higher values need to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need any more gra@@ ins , so you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of a film effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited the ( 2 ) . the used film @-@ sensitivity meets ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; filter oil paintings generates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural paintings and breast@@ life are good for this effect .
there are two shelves to influence this effect . the upper ones cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thick@@ er brus@@ hes are better suited for large images . smooth@@ es controls the bul@@ ls or , from the other side , the arti@@ cul@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil paintings effect . the original one is with the ( 1 ) and the edited is marked with the ( 2 ) . paper size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; filter coal drawing is used to create a coher@@ ent degree . the lines that change the surround in the drawing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sket@@ ching you . these would be good pictures to begin with it .
there are two shelves with a value @-@ range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regul@@ ator cho@@ oses the foundation size and the lower just@@ iert the contrast ( slip ) .
this is an example of the cart @-@ clear@@ er filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the altered image ( 2 ) . the default set of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adapting the Int@@ ensity Array .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; filter engra@@ ving your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stolen in wax . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to re @-@ give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in its content . the filter makes use of the differences between color and intensity , in order to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ opol@@ y landscape .
the depth allows it to adjust the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , is equivalent to 10 % , is the default .
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
with this fil@@ ter@@ group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of dist@@ or@@ ism . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ blocks 1 : shares the image in the cells and makes it look , as if it is seen by glass blocks .
w@@ ave@@ blocks 2 : an@@ alogue to the shaft @-@ blocks 1 is dist@@ orted the image here in a different version of gl@@ ass@@ beads .
some effects need a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the kno@@ b button .
with this fil@@ tering option you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of dis@@ shar@@ p@@ ness effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
Zoom Un@@ tough@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image along a glob@@ ular lines which can be of a central point . this sim@@ ulates the har@@ p@@ ness a zo@@ oming image and thus generates a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography .
radi@@ ale in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ ring the image by rotation of the pixels for a centre . this sim@@ ulates the dis@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a revol@@ ving camera .
remove @-@ bl@@ ings : don &apos;t wi@@ red the picture to generate the effect of a not focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
movement @-@ bl@@ ings : bl@@ ur@@ ring the image through horizontal motion of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the bl@@ ur@@ red@@ ness of one linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
soft@@ ens Un@@ p@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image soft to the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates pictures with a dre@@ amy and sh@@ iny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portra@@ its , gl@@ am@@ our photos or to add a warm and subtle bul@@ b .
she@@ ar @-@ bl@@ ings : bl@@ ur@@ ring the image through random shift of pixels and sim@@ ulates the bl@@ ur@@ red@@ ness of one of the arbitr@@ ary camera .
intelligent in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : finds the coloured bas@@ ins in the image and bl@@ ur@@ red it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectang@@ le cells and then creates it , through the col@@ t with an average score , new .
some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the kno@@ b button .
the rain drops are a cute little tool to make rain drops in your image . this gives it natural your pictures a n@@ our@@ e appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n ur@@ righ@@ ted algorith@@ m .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of the dri@@ ps . as the dri@@ pping size is not automatically growing with the size of the image . number changes the number and the density of drops . fish changes the optical effect of drops in the picture .
you can stick with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; image editing an area free of rain drops . just use the tool to choose the area , e.g. a face , which is to stay for free . if you then start the filter by reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p , the area will remain free from rain drops .
this is an example of the drop @-@ drop filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard @-@ values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it through mir@@ rors or rotating into the right orientation . the tools to be found in the menu transform and transform mir@@ rors .
photo b@@ lowing is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo to enlarge with a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to smaller size is simple . the big question is how can you get an image bli@@ stered the details ? how can you find the missing information back or gu@@ essed ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorith@@ m is used here , makes it a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size in the menu and enter the destination . the dialog is visible below .
the tool to change size uses a linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation method to counter the pixels . if you want to enlarge a little picture with better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ atable .
many image editing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; used a further developed approach . the underlying algorith@@ m composition was developed by I@@ MAGE Team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to say the tool like you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
one @-@ of @-@ aspect ratio is : if this setting is enabled , the new size of the original size will be the original aspect of the original image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set . this is necessary , when a lot of noise is pre@@ dominant , since it is difficult to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect he has to be set higher than 3 .
buttons as and loading are used exactly to be used . each fil@@ ing for photo enlarge can be saved as a text file and can be loaded again later .
photo infl@@ atable is very fast with what it makes , but it can still be very long and a high CPU load to pull out . you can ab@@ ort the calculation at any time using the kno@@ b button .
you can see below an example of picture infl@@ atable , by wi@@ dening a small color picture of the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the Pre@@ view ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlar@@ ging the comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not only a common surgery but also a commonly under@@ estimated tool to compile an image . the picture editing allows this very easy . to make a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and draw the rectang@@ le to generate . you will see this rectang@@ le then you &apos;ll see the mouse .
if you let the mouse go back again the area of the photo will cut off the way off . you can change the size of the subject area by drawing on the corners of the rectang@@ le . a new rectang@@ le helps you by simply drag it with the left mouse button .
once you are happy with the dis@@ section , use the button @-@ button @-@ button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar , and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file saving or file stor@@ ing under the file to save the newly cro@@ pped photo .
in the educational area , you can change the size of the rectang@@ le by putting the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you have defined in dialogue will remain intact .
Set in the tool following aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the larger value of the height and the Quer@@ y@@ format will always be assigned to the width .
the tool helps cut a relative side ratio . that means it always is equal to whether you use centi@@ meters , inches or any other physical size . you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue , two buttons are existing around the selection automatically horiz@@ ont@@ ally or vertical .
below in the dialog you can set with the Max . relationship to the area for cutting on the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation , set .
the tool to cut off @-@ ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ ontal or Vertical ) . if you use the tri@@ mmer tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation . the modified image measurements are reflected in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data stored the cro@@ pped image and does not reflect the original image .
the settings of the comp@@ elling aid enable assistance to help you put your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ious triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third tel@@ eg@@ s , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a rectang@@ le in a similarly harmon@@ ious tri@@ angles .
Golden center : the golden center is a division for a variety of natural growth times , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us Musch@@ el or the Bl@@ üt@@ ten@@ blätter of a sun@@ flower . it emerg@@ es in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful .
the Golden partition is the ir@@ ration@@ ale number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used already by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used to give your tem@@ ples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects made the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; off , where every number after 1 is equal to the sum of its two previous figures . one composition that this rule is followed as vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious .
the golden center will be liquid @-@ lines available when you put an image . these aid are en@@ listed below :
the golden spiral will bring you close to your target good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ party screen , the golden spiral generates a smooth line of the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the view of the observer along the line of the spiral and creates a balanced visual river on this type .
a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also known , to create the golden spiral . it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this something can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfil its function .
the Golden Tri@@ angles is also guided by the above golden spiral . your ver@@ ti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden tri@@ angles . please note that contrary to the harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , Golden tri@@ angles are no equ@@ als tri@@ angles . di@@ agon@@ ale to place these lines can be released a static object dynam@@ ical .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to finish your frame . try to put your photo focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tr@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can not achieve any otherwise .
the options horiz@@ ont@@ ally reflected and Vertical are being used to mirror the harmon@@ ious sub@@ missions .
with the button color , you can put the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with lots of colors and a high contrast , the auxili@@ ary lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to turn a picture to any angle .
if you make a photo , then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera exactly ver@@ tically or horizontal . this creates a picture in which the things turned around a angle . you can fix this with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; image processing and tool free rotation . simply select free rotation , and adjust the target angle .
turn your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can put the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right top .
for your help , the module free rotation of horizontal and vertical line is available . move the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor to position the two lines , you can set it up with a pressure on the left mouse button . right now , you adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have fil@@ med a picture you will find unwanted three holes in the corners . a way to fix it is the function transform cutting from the editing .
an elegant way to crop the image is the function key cutting . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing smooth@@ es the image a bit after the fil@@ ming . but keep in mind the same warning .
all current transform@@ ations are carried out by a fix@@ ture on the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you must use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically calculated . on the right of the dialogue you will find some information which help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels .
angle on the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transform area .
angle Top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transforming area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transforming area .
angle on the right bottom : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transforming area .
after adjust@@ ing the perspective the picture gets a little poll@@ uted . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adapt@@ ations produce a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after which you adapted the perspective , you get un@@ mistak@@ able tri@@ ang@@ ular holes in the corners . a way to ber@@ some it is the image to cut out of the editing .
the tool system is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part to the opposite . a horizontal tail , i.e. the image is dist@@ orted just . in other words , a rectang@@ le becomes transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogra@@ m . you can transform this module through transform@@ ers .
move your picture by using the Horiz@@ ontal angle and the vertical angle . you can press horizontal and vertical at the same time . if you put on preference . a preview of effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target picture are displayed on the right of the th@@ umb@@ nail .
with your help becomes a vertical and horizontal straight line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse kno@@ b to fix the lines . you can now use the tool system to adjust your image .
after which you have performed the embar@@ ras@@ sment , the picture gets a bit &apos; wis@@ ely . for a single shift , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two mark@@ ers are created twice as much cru@@ ci@@ ent and therefore you should avoid this .
after she@@ ar the image has un@@ beautiful tri@@ ang@@ ular holes in the corners . a way to eliminate it is the image to cut down from picture editing .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were comp@@ ised . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ;
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to provide a list of all information available on your system . however , you will always be JPEG and TI@@ FF .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; displays only files in form@@ ulas to know . this happens by the extension and a comparison of these with a defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can change this list of file informations , which can change . in the section configuration you will find more information to this .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to choose the format used in Wikipedia . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; supports both formats .
image comp@@ ression is the application of data @-@ comp@@ ression procedure on digital images . in this way red@@ und@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on an effective way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there are better , smo@@ other results as JPEG on the same comp@@ ression ratio . the 2000 version can also be dis@@ able if this is stated in the settings .
if you want to know more about the raw format , you can read on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Col@@ our very helpful guides to read in English . you can easily convert raw format pictures in JPEG or TI@@ FF . in the section configuration you can find further information about the use of modules with a company .

many tools you need to take the photo editing are in &amp; di@@ gi@@ dy@@ ed ; your description will follow here .
all the tool@@ ing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ ens , rou@@ gh@@ ing , bl@@ ur@@ red , bl@@ ur , etc ; . use a uniform type type that is applied to the current image before the filter appears on the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture App@@ lic@@ quot ; in this dialogue :
( 1 ) : this progress report shows the status of the filter on the current image . links from him allow five buttons to change the syn@@ onymous mode of the march @-@ area . these modes are :
vertical split without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area right of the selected tip area .
horiz@@ ont@@ ally share with no dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected tip area .
the left area displays the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper area shows the original and the lower comparison to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the image when the mouse is not in the th@@ umb@@ nail range and otherwise the original .

( 3 ) : the frame for the Pre@@ view Pre@@ view . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the picture and put on the part of the picture from which you view the preview . the view in the left part of the dialog is updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left hand corner : here is one help and possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all settings of the last use of the module are marked .
the side@@ bar properties shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely explained itself . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
Photo@@ Properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider is made available on the Mar@@ ble mini@@ tool , based on the Mar@@ ble mini@@ ature . you can push it with the mouse wheel or rip it and move it . move the mouse button to drag a square . all the images within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this requires your paintings Geo @-@ data .

you can choose one color somewhere on the screen and then you will find them in the color cho@@ p on the left .
&amp; graph@@ s ; is a KDE program for the viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s are free layout programmes . graph@@ s are available in science , especially in the computer sciences . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; the program used to visu@@ alize graphics . the programs , the &amp; graph@@ y@@ z ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few features .
the &amp; graph@@ viewer ; the project has set itself the goal of re@@ placing these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; graph@@ graph@@ s ; is a KDE program for watching &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s are free layout programs . &amp; graph@@ s ; shows graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; the graph@@ s neu and in &amp; graph@@ viewer ; represents )
menu , to open the graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; opening or graph@@ s in &amp; c@@ graph@@ ed ; in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ component to open
loading of big graph@@ s ( currently there are problems with about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack in order to illustrate more than these no@@ des )
additional required Software : &amp; C@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program , which puts the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of the graph@@ s required . required in detail :
the main window indicates the open graph@@ s , each in its own window . initially , if you start a argument , the main window is empty like in the bottom screens@@ hot . in this case , the tool@@ bar only opened the icon file and the ( blank ) list posted . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after having selected one or more &amp; dot files , the window looks like in the bottom screens@@ hot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the Grap@@ h is bigger than the palette . you can select with the context menu , or select this position automatically .
the mouse wheel use ( high and r@@ unter without special @-@ power , left and right at op@@ pressing &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by the factor 10 . below , you will see the maximum cl@@ load of a graph@@ s .
if the file displayed in &amp; graph@@ viewer ; loaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Grap@@ h will be re@@ loaded or whether you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision , so later on . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu item in the menu structure ; see also .
if you open a graph@@ ite outside of an ongoing &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; the instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you will have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; c@@ graph@@ viewer ; an instance or to watch the lad@@ der graph@@ s in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with setting up dialog .
in the program start , you can let all graph@@ s have come back again . again , you can save your choice both and later on .
you can also specify how the graph can be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sites can be freely chosen .
when you use several pages , you can choose if the parts of the graph@@ s are used on a side to fit on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the parts of the graph@@ s .
page preview with one on several sides distributed with no head@@ line and with another font .
the site once again gives a chance to specify the behavior if a file was changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can specify a standard method ( automatically re@@ load , or ignore the changes ) or the program for each time .
the site opens the possibility of setting the behaviour of a graphic @-@ viewer ; if a graph opened outside of a running meeting ( graph@@ s in a new window , or in a sub@@ window of the current session ) or determine that each time will be consul@@ ted .
the site administration gives the possibility to set the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; they can set up a standard method ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine if they are asked at any start .
the context menu which usually starts with a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorith@@ m , the standard for judicial graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered concepts of stra@@ igh@@ tened graph@@ s . the algorith@@ m puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then attempts to produce as short edges and as few ben@@ ches .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorith@@ m is the standard for un@@ illumin@@ ated graph@@ s . it produces performers according to the spr@@ ing@@ feder@@ acy . thereby , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Kaw@@ ai algorith@@ m is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
der &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ algorith@@ m creates a spr@@ ing@@ feder@@ ate model layout . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ Heu@@ rist@@ ik , and includes a multi @-@ condition timer to treat large and clu@@ ster graph@@ s .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; -@@ algorith@@ m outputs the k@@ not circular , according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . he is useful for specific di@@ agrams of several cy@@ c@@ lical structures .
opens a dialog in which you can specify a layer command , which will then apply from a shell , and the calculated layout of graph@@ s can be displayed as parameter , and the calculated layout of graph@@ s can change them &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms special options , or also the graph@@ s with a filter appears before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph@@ s ( directed or un@@ eri@@ zes ) and uses the default algorith@@ m for each type ( dot ; for stra@@ igh@@ tened , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ qualified graph@@ s ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview is displayed , if this is necessary . otherwise it is not shown and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the What is the -@@ mouse @-@ cur@@ sor . click with this mouse button on a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get more help to this item ( if available ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images input provides tools to be added to new pictures and to get rid of them .
this module can be used to inter@@ im new images and to store files . currently , two sources can be used :
images scan : using the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner , supported by SAN@@ E project or any other source like e.g. Video streams . for this , you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SAN@@ E installed .
when you scan the menu items you will open a dialog that allows you to choose between all available sources on your machine . select the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the standard source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by selecting the pre @-@ given standard @-@ values du@@ cr@@ he can replace your image accordingly . take a look at the area scanning on your needs . the estimated file size is displayed in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information .
make sure the window will be completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed .
once you have pushed to the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the options of the image file . here , you can &apos;t comp@@ ressed the comp@@ ression and type of image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the file by selecting the image .
screen photos can create you after you have selected Im@@ ported &gt; screens@@ hot ... you can find a window in which you can indicate the different screens@@ hot of the screens@@ hot :
select The complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all own program windows are selected will disappear , the open program will disappear , so you will see other scre@@ ens and windows . otherwise , you will drop after a short delay to read the currently visible place . if you have selected the complete desktop reading , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay controls how long screens@@ hot will be waiting before it starts . if you have to switch to other working spaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate .
once the screens@@ hot was created , the dialog options in the target image will appear with the options described above .

the K@@ IP@@ I module to geographic loc@@ alization permits it to add and edit GPS coordinates in the met@@ adata of an image , and the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF sam@@ pling of the image and loc@@ alization may be displayed in a card in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization offers tools at its disposal to be used geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordinates , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo , loc@@ alize . height , long@@ itude and lat@@ itu@@ dinal @-@ grey are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ px @-@ file format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate to the main window and call the menu on . the above mentioned dialog box then . to load a track file with G@@ P@@ X file , you need to load a trace file with G@@ P@@ X file , which of course , included in the same places as images of your camera .
if the file loaded a automatic cor@@ relation performed which shows the coordinates in red . GPS Track data are recorded in GMT @-@ time , and therefore the camera should be calculated with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera zone here .
the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and cam@@ er@@ ce . lies the vari@@ ance among them the data are gathered together . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have a track record of a place for pictures you can edit the g@@ px file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference from 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and differ@@ ential in min. can be used if you don &apos;t have the right data . if you know that in reality an loc@@ ating difference between camera and GPS is , you can set this limits and then press the button cor@@ relate to the inter@@ pol@@ ish .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful when you have a number of photos on the same place . as the dialog use the coordinates from a call to the next notice you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the loc@@ ating can also be found and set @-@ up with the indicated area and enlarge . select this always through until you have achieved a sufficient accuracy . the map can always be selected manually . the map can be swit@@ ched between card mode , satellite images and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ ag@@ tool used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module photo gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01 . you can select the albums as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the string will add U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings may be adjusted . the rider is allowed to select all albums only . the albums are not hierarch@@ ically displayed , with the three buttons on the right you will quickly see a large number of albums . in the field below , the Al@@ ben@@ ch@@ Show and the text of the page will appear in the header of the HTML page .
the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each side . the rider is largely asser@@ ting itself . if you click on a picture , a new page will be displayed in which the picture is displayed . otherwise , the picture will be displayed directly with your default , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your associated images . select a folder of which you have to write . a sub@@ folder containing the name of KI@@ PI@@ HTML@@ Export , which everything contains , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF data gets stored in the new images as well .
with other color depth , you can set the standard color depth , which naturally also influences the file size . all other settings are explained by yourself .
the rider th@@ umb@@ nails will give you some of the settings from the album tab for the nail pictures that are small images that are shown in the gallery .
a progress window indicates the user as far the action is . press copies to break down the process .
when the module has created the pages , the window will not automatically be closed . you can therefore view the program messages to determine if error occurred during the generation . your web browser will start automatically in the end to preview the gallery . press closing around the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture concerned is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool in order to look at pictures .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture consider it to view a selection of pictures and run on them base operations such as scre@@ en@@ ings , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short explanations and mo@@ ist . it was developed for a quick image display and fast access to its functions .
after the start a picture is displayed by default in the full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG adap@@ table module is a tool to change images without inter@@ f@@ ere with your quality .
this module allows for the current promotions to save images in the JPEG format , without saving the usual losses in quality or met@@ adata .
the consequence of the los@@ sy @-@ free storage is it that will increase the file size because no comp@@ ression of the far@@ bin@@ ations is taking place . this can be found e.g. in the PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I @-@ Module Met@@ adata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mail@@ ing@@ liste k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import -@@ function of met@@ adata module you can copy data from one image to another . then select the drop @-@ down dialog with which you can select the file image , so the image to which you want to copy the met@@ adata format . the data will be copied to which you have pressed it to the button OK .
this function does not work in all kinds of image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not into any destination . JPEG is supported on writing . please check out ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in form of a slideshow .
the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , using a defined length , convert the package M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the single images you can insert a basic screen output . you can also add a audio file at the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow .
all images are sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module , you can create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the images that are packed into the MPEG of Di@@ ash@@ au . after that , you can create the extras M@@ MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au and start the module .
the images you selected are then included in the image files . there you can also change s@@ orting of images or the content of the list .
once you are happy with your list , you should adapt the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to select the file on a TV set , you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that will indicate a picture . a low value will be created very sudden , a high contrast very flat screen change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should leave it black . the name and the path of the created file allows you to define under the name of MPEG @-@ output file .
if you specify a audio file under name of audio source file , then this will be integrated into the film . depending on the speed of your b@@ ills , you can get a coffee with the button . depending on the speed of your b@@ ills you can get a cup of coffee and enjoy the slideshow you are back again .
if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or Tools will be missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages via the button settings right down .
the printing assistant allows multiple images on a sheet paper together in standard photo@@ graphi@@ es . the combined images can also automatically be opened using the image editing Gimp . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or print with the Gimp module to direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import and convert your data to one of three formats in one of three formats , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ tool d@@ cra@@ b from Dave Coff@@ in . an original quot@@ ation of Him is : expect the same results as the software from your camera body . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ b better results ! .
first select the RAW file that is to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image conver@@ ter window appears then in mode for a single picture . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings at the picture .
you can now read@@ just the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option will decide whether the camera set to be used for the white prints . the key parameters such as g@@ amma , bri@@ ghtness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colors R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be chosen for you to use the contrac@@ ted information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switches has no effect .
once you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and keep the conversion output . the fil@@ ename remains equal and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a ver@@ itable algorith@@ m and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tagged Image format , TI@@ FF , ret@@ ains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ sy @-@ free laser comp@@ ression .
if you prefer to edit your pictures frequently or do it later , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it is only a limited number of operations allowing the image quality wor@@ sen@@ ing . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the met@@ adata that contain in the raw file are stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
when you adjust your settings you can start with the execute button . if you want to cancel this process , you can use the Canc@@ el .
the for@@ kli@@ ft mode allows you to convert various images at once . use this mode for sure if you are sure , e.g. by testing in a single picture , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to re@@ sign the file automatically . however , this is helpful if it is produced in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . however , the progress report is prog@@ ressed as far the conversion .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it used the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following picture formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ aming all images of a albums . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting figures and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it used the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can smaller or enlarge the image . these are provided four types of images :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size in a dimension . the width or height of the image will be automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to custom@@ ize your image to screen .
dis@@ proportional : dis@@ proportion@@ ate size in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed when this option .
print preparation : prepare the image for the photo printing . the user can set the print resolution and the size of the phot@@ op@@ api@@ ers . the target picture , including background size , edge @-@ size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the add@@ led images beforehand . further images can be drawn to the list of images to appear .
after which you started the module , the thum@@ b will be displayed in the pictures selected from you . over the button images you can add more pictures with a file @-@ selection dialog . for the most recently cli@@ cked picture is shown a preview on the right page .
you can also drag illustrations on the Picture list and add them to the list of images to add to the list .
with the button photographs , the selected images will be removed from the list of extrac@@ ting images .
once you have selected all the pictures you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you only need to add the addresses and the header pages . the pictures selected are attached to you as an attachment .
do not pay attention to many pictures at one time . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of emails . it &apos;s possibly a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send many pictures .
the email windows will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and every time you use it again until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , so you must specify in the input field , including the correct path to your installation .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the agent on your computer beforehand . you can download it here .
after the selection of comments to a recorded file , the comments on the pictures will be put together into a text file and attached to the email .
the PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of phot@@ od@@ files , but it is best adapted among the los@@ sy form@@ ulas like e.g. TI@@ FF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG among images file format and are the original files in the JPEG format , then the original ec@@ if@@ data are added to the results .
if the process is ready , the window will not automatically be closed so you can look at the status bar searching for errors . however , your E @-@ mail program is automatically started at the end . with the button . you can send this window g@@ ly ? en .
after the starting of the module Fort@@ gesch@@ ritt@@ ene Di@@ ash@@ au , a window will appear with questions like you have shown your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the option OpenGL @-@ trans@@ itions in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant image transfers using OpenGL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , since otherwise the slideshow is very slow .
the option fil@@ ename makes sure that the fil@@ ename of the images in the left corner is displayed during the presentation .
the option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . you can then manually pull together with Es@@ c ; ab@@ ort .
the option images random@@ ly choose that the images are displayed in a random order . therefore , it is not used the order of the images in the album .
taking delay between the images can be set the tim@@ eless distance between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . you should be inter@@ f@@ tly before you show your friends !
there are over a dozen transition @-@ out effects among which you can choose . by chance , choosing a different effect in every transition between pictures .
during the slideshow you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left side of the screen . move your mouse into this corner to turn off .
with this tool@@ bar you can hold the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slideshow .
in the left side of the screen , you can view the current fil@@ ename , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date just@@ ifying currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background is a tool to set a picture as a background picture for the working surface .
this module consists of the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the menu , as the backdrop for your KDE work@@ space .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , you can play with &amp; k@@ photographs , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , are now available in every group , so in people , places and in group keywords .
in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have given information as you have provided your pictures and videos with comments . additionally there are entries to look at EX@@ IF @-@ based information , to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course the current preliminary pictures .
when you press the mouse to the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture .
if you choose to choose another person only the images are displayed on which both individuals are to see . through this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed in a few thousand pictures on some individual images .
if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view with th@@ umb@@ nails to look at the pictures of your car range .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol before their name . you can store with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . however , for each person they can store their own picture @-@ picture , this also applies to places , keywords , and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the picture .
to view images next to the name you choose the button that you choose from the right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can choose the view for each category separately . that &apos;s the advantage that you can see for example symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords . ( if you have no suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you must define yourself what image is displayed for each individual person . in order to view this , you have to view the image editor &apos;s text ( in more detail ) , then select the image for the appropriate person . in the view window , you can adjust the enlar@@ ging factor according to your wishes and selecting which part of the picture is displayed and can be cut or edited .
if you wake up in the main window in the entry , will give you a dialogue that is very similar to the dialog to capture the image properties . this dialog can be seen on the picture once again .
if you enter a character string into the box or description , the circum@@ cis@@ ings and descriptions of images are searching for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for example , for example 1971 , or the entire date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window you can browse all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Is@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are pic@@ tured .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . if you do not want to read hand@@ books , but rather try to try different functions , you have the following alternatives to this guide :
go to the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and look at the quick @-@ up , the screen photos and the intro@@ duc@@ tions .
launch &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialogue the demo , in case you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select in the menu help menu navigation album ; -@@ demo . then , some examples are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a continuous HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this ly@@ re you see here : . as the name suggests , this pop@@ s shows you data statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different tim@@ eless@@ ness . each ly@@ re shows then a different unit . you can change between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see a part of a database by pointing the gro@@ in only 10 minutes sections .
the tim@@ eline allows you to inter@@ active in the following ways : you can view the displayed input view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date is displayed in the preview feature ) and in addition , the tim@@ eline will always display the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you can navigate in the preview .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button , and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so when selecting an area , you will be displayed in the preview view only pictures of this time period . you can set the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you two options available to create HTML @-@ websites with your images . one is integrated into &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as a module ( see above ) . in the following part of the user &apos;s manual , the version is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version you can create via the Menu HTML ...
before HTML pages you will need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described more accurately .
first enter the title of the bli@@ cks and a description that is supposed to include the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . -@@ expor@@ ters will be created on the overview page . approxim@@ ate information about the export files you can find in .
finally , you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed . thus , you can avoid that information is displayed on the viewer also without a description . for example , all pictures of a party are . you can not use these settings therefore to hide specific images from certain spect@@ ators .
in this section you can specify how to look the HTML pages . most adjustment possibilities are clear , which is why this is not specifically made .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . there@@ for , those who want to view your website and have a monitor , which supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images can download , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time . so he can change your pictures with lower resolution , so as to search a lower transmission time , so if he wants to get an idea bigger he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , you place the different folder and the URL , where your site is stored .
best select for all of your HTML files a base folder and for each subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder .
first , you must select the root folder in which all your images are stored . this folder is automatically added and the next time you can set . you can choose either a folder or a KDE supported protocol for example :
once you have created your pictures , you can check if this really should be visible for the viewer . if you have created for the base folder a URL will start a web browser after the pages has been created . the URL you set here should start this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the import of you created HTML files still do not have to copy them in the final destination , see , correctly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the actual files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are .
the settings described above have changed all three to the base folder or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you can specify in the output folder .
if you &apos;re on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; they are , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the images . however , if you have already done a lot of time for watching pictures , recording , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not even be done .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import it into your database . the picture properties are related to ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it whether the images are stored by the file or if the file is only a link to images . the advantage all images can be stored in the file , that you can share all the images and that this file can be accessed independently . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the file , or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches for the pictures in any doubt . first , the images found in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . the corresponding pictures will not be found , so the pictures of the URL you have indicated in creating HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML @-@ Export .
in the following , the dialog is described for the export of images to export something to export .
the main option of this dialogue is whether it is to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files , the following three choices are available :
when option manu@@ ell to copy the .@@ k@@ im file you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Autom@@ atic near the .@@ k@@ im file copy copied &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images are automatically copied for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip @-@ files . as most pictures already have been comp@@ ressed with JPEG comp@@ ressed and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you do this , you simply select the option export file comp@@ ress .
the last option of this page reads maximum menu size . if you want to send your friends pictures , you might not want to send the images in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size , for example , that each image is at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file impor@@ ter , it will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the exported databases as described in .
the assistant to the impor@@ ter consists of four steps . at first , you have to select which images you want to import , afterwards , in which folder the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category individuals who are in your database ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is in part of your database . therefore , you will be imported into the third dialog window , which categories of the imported file should be imported into your database .
the fourth step allows you to import the categories of the imported file with the categories of your present database . an example of this can be seen in the picture .
it must be easy to browse these images and to see : if you look at pictures you often want to watch within various picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you are looking for example pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the images on which this friend is pic@@ tured .
in this manual you will run the different steps from ( 1 ) Fest@@ ing the information about your paintings , via ( 2 ) the di@@ arr@@ he@@ a and pre@@ stige to run through ( 3 ) advanced themes and adapt@@ ations .
K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program for the Man@@ age of your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it also takes your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this also closes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . these are a simple XML file containing a program of your choice , e.g. normal backup tools , copy on a flo@@ pp@@ y or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , you can .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notes the folder in which your images are stored and used it automatically . if you would like to use another database of pictures , you can start a different folder with images , you can run &amp; k@@ photographs , with the option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
over the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; setup ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of the user @-@ book , you will find the various settings options .
links see six different symbols , with which you can preview the options of view and the options for the viewer . for each setting there is an extensive help available to the one button on the F1 button , and a click on the desired option .
in it , you describe how you can set different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and cat@@ fish . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums .
you see the dialog , which is used to process existing groups . for each existing group you can choose a marking and symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options you can establish full member groups , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group instead of declar@@ ing all the groups of a member as described in .
in view of the adjustment possibilities , which are available to you for the capture of the member groups . with the above listed list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left @-@ hand corner you will find a list of the current category and in the right list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares the module system with other graphic applications , such as di@@ gi@@ Kam and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . approxim@@ ate information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called through the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this book because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; are they are distributed separately . however , most modules also have a help page which you can call via the modules themselves .
since the modules are used by multiple applications among each other , it may be that the modules were using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . this is why you should always test new modules first with the demo database , before using it on your own pictures , demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . say not , I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules on K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , making it be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that are also called K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications run their images in albums : this kind of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates it for some modules the order for albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
these sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the present album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all images , which show you the picture show at the moment .
besides the current album you have to go up &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; these modules also make a list of albums submitted . on this occasion he goes on &amp; k@@ ron@@ album . as follows :
if your browser displays the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will have defined the category , which you have specified in the dialog dialog as a category for virtual albums . for example , for example , use the category , will have chosen &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . so , whether you would have selected persons to view and share it with this module .
because some modules are compatible with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the entry dialog and select the area modules that you want to load .
on the picture you will see an example of an starting screen , as soon as you start running on your own pictures ; you can start your own pictures .
as you are used by any other KDE application , see the tool@@ bar you can easily browse the window above . at the moment , you will not find a lot of information about your paintings . in the section we will look back on this window , but then click on the entries to show you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the opportunity to view each image with comments . these include information about the persons appearing on the image . you can either set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures specific comments at the same time . if for example , click on all pictures Jes@@ per and all pictures in Copenhagen have been recorded .
all these notes can be used for searching and brow@@ sing as you can read in the section . if you want to view these comments if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
in view you can see three lists with a text box by using people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use it again when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea lies the moving of the images on the list : if you have a family party , and on all 50 paintings , the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are pic@@ tured , you can find that the names of the names are moved up , the people find faster and as@@ sign .
if you prefer to see a alphab@@ e@@ tically stored list , click on the icon for S@@ orting date under the list .
if you have selected remarks on each image individually , you might want to edit any selected images and provide those images with any notes . in this case simply click the front and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the right .
if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to highlight all these images and provided the menu item at a time with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
in the picture , you will see a browser window of the USA as a market group . to show you that it is an abundance , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the ana@@ dial@@ ogs , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally you can also put an entry simply on a category and insert it to make this one sub@@ category of this item . attention , this requires that you just sort your categories alphab@@ e@@ tically . see also .
you can shift the single elements of the attrac@@ ting dial@@ ogs by train the gro@@ in that form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by setting it outside the window .
if you adjust the look of the window to your needs , then you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button below ... , which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also leave a box completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the button below ... and then window a / hide . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser you get an overview with th@@ umb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or any images if you do not have a filter here . you can configure the size of the th@@ umb@@ nails , by simply writing down the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it just time .
if you leave an image on the background of your desktop , this image is set as background picture for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the picture concerned . if you don &apos;t have a window with a picture concerned , a new indicator will be created .
you can also delete images in the picture preview . simply select the appropriate images that you want to delete or select either the Del@@ ete button , or select the menu item to choose from . now , you will see the window you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you for this problem a solution . you can also use it with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . you can also use the images somewhere else , so you can capture the pictures somewhere , so you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . if not all of the needed images can be loaded from the hard disk .
images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for example , images 5 @-@ 9 are present , however , the pre@@ viewing images can display . however , you can see the pictures from these images . however , they can not view these images with the picture concerned .
as you see , you need to copy files from the folders and copy them into . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore , you have not yet to ask for the inser@@ tion of the corresponding CD . if you wish to avoid trouble @-@ locking your images , please purchase a bigger disk in order to be able to save all the images on it .
in the menu images you will find a sub@@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , click on the images so that you want to see for others in@@ accessible and click on Lat@@ est View privacy . alternatively , you can also see all images that may see your little sister , anst@@ eu@@ es and the menu entry .
with this you have set what images in the case of the case will be hidden . if you lock the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu entry into the menu , ren@@ dering all the images you have blocked , and when you want to see the images again , click here .
it is also possible to set a password to set the images entered . to set this password , simply select password in the menu of privacy .
please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe . for one , all pictures on the hard disk and the other can access the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file to read the password as un@@ encryp@@ ted text ; not very familiar to those who are using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to honor the view on private pictures .
the reason why you manage all of your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with them is of course that you want to see them at some point . this is why you can see them at some point . this is why you can preview them from the preview , as described in .
the viewer can see you in . it naturally displays the picture , but additional all the information you have displayed about the image , such as who is on the image , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box is on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can easily move it with the mouse and move it elsewhere . all these options are displayed based on the viewer . all these options are available after a right @-@ click menu on the viewer . you can see the log@@ ging menu button below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here on the browser , see the suitable entries related to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you would choose from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by using the buttons image high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also available from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as a slideshow . like frequently it loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it &apos;s a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and Plus or minus . also , the slideshow is replaced by the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the be@@ holder of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is in the full @-@ screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer , you can put in the image in the image and sc@@ zo@@ oming . to the entry point you can simply drag a rectang@@ le . with the min@@ us button you can reverse again r@@ er@@ zo@@ oming the plus button zo@@ oming in the middle of the image . shows how a z@@ oom @-@ rectang@@ le is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can ref@@ rain your Zoom on which the image is not shown zo@@ omed . with the same key places the zo@@ oms , so that each pixels is in the screen of an image of the image .
note that the only Zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations that work with videos that are in and zo@@ oming containing the Plus@@ - and Min@@ acou@@ st@@ ics .
with the fil@@ ename from the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current image with the menu item .
when you look at images it can happen that you will find an image with a person whose names you have forgotten to put on the picture . at the moment you can see the check @-@ break and configuration dialog of the picture to give this name . however , you will perhaps prefer to mark the image and see more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and visu@@ alize them as well or po@@ or@@ ly , while you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the spect@@ ator offers the possibility to provide photos with features , while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can push a characteristic that you can press the corresponding letter . see a picture in which the features A , B and C are set .
once you have any features set on your pictures , these are available to you . so , if you have selected all the images you can edit , print or whatever you chose . then , you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD , or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in viewing points . if you can view categories in D@@ re pre@@ views , then you can press some features to the pictures , simply selecting the letters for the character after the picture was chosen . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on an image . this case allows you to paint &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the picture to paint .
the mixture is not stored with the image but in the database . the way you can do it back @-@ old later .
in you can see an image on the painted table . to turn the Mal@@ mo@@ dus of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . to turn on the picture from the context menu . to finish the cap , you simply put the cross at the tool@@ bar top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you must not control the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; but the documentation for Pov@@ ray ; should you have read and understand the documentation .
in the object @-@ tree , you can select individual objects . then , their properties are displayed in the object properties and display the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of a previously selected object , since all the objects already are selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon at the tool@@ bar , or select an menu entry into the menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following folding menu appears to be built @-@ in , so that you can choose the correct position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right mouse button you have to remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have altered attributes , click on apply to take these modifications . do you have inv@@ ali@@ d values , a message will be displayed with a bug description . then you can correct the input content and click on it or re @-@ create changes to ab@@ ort .
when you enter the path to a Pov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setting of dialog , you can use the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you do need the Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 will already contain the user documentation .
if you edit an texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the auto@@ nearby view .
press your preview in the DIY @-@ view and a small example of the scene is struc@@ ted with your chosen texture , even if you want to have a sub@@ sorted element ( for example a texture inside a texture ) and not the whole texture ( map ) , you cross locally .
the screens@@ hot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag this check with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation , as well as the position for re@@ pris@@ ons . you can change the shifting through pul@@ ling using the mouse within the whole window .
every object has a wire level of view . you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the higher level of view or as an absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their views level smaller or equal in the tool@@ bar @-@ level of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window administration as a default . the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you do not like the default copy , or if you need a different type of order , you can set it on any other hand . you can also save multiple shut@@ ters and simply change between different arrangements .
to an@@ chor a window above or under one view , drag the start to the top or bottom of a view . a rectang@@ le shows then the new position .
to create a new column , drag the trial to the right or right side of a view . the new view will be installed on the right or left side of this view and covers the whole amount .
if you would like to arrange several views over one another , take the beginning in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the box @-@ card from above in the views .
the last possible shut@@ ters are p@@ ending views , views , which are not ens@@ hr@@ ined in the main window . to view a view from the fil@@ ing , drag the starting point to the desktop or click on the small according to the upper left arrow in the address .
to close a view , click on the small cross at the address called . to prevent the closing , click the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu you can find entries for any type of views . new views are sch@@ web@@ end , you can be anch@@ oring them to any one .
you can store the current window list with View window ... save it . it will be a dialog , in which you can store the toler@@ ances under an existing or new name .
if you created a scene , you can ren@@ dering it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ dering this program , was &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 aktuell . this version is currently in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 not supported .
to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ ate To ren@@ dering the icon in the tool@@ bar , or select the menu item menu .
a stir@@ ring mode corresponds to the entries in a Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it controls the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full balance of the highest quality .
if you click on the icon of The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar , or in the View View R@@ ender Mod@@ i , the following dialogue will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but makes a name that can be seen the characteristics of the mode .
in map @-@ card size you can insert the width and height of the rounded image . if you just want to ren@@ dering a small area of the image , choose the cross @-@ section sub@@ section and indicate the image @-@ section to ren@@ dering in the input fields .
in the combination of quality you can select the characteristics that &amp; Pov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering it . this goes from a very simple paint and light model to a model with complex de@@ diff@@ user ref@@ lex@@ ions . a detailed description of the R@@ ender &apos;s properties can be found in the user &apos;s manual too &amp; Pov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is t@@ apped with just one ray per pixel , there may be various errors . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è patterns or lay@@ ered effects in cur@@ ves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called Anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . in general pictures with this property are better off .
if you switch to anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and links &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique means super @-@ sam@@ pling .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sam@@ pling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sam@@ pling is the neighbouring pixels with one . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive because every pixel is continually spread further and adap@@ tive because the re@@ tired ble@@ w moves from the calculated shades .
if you choose the first method , follow POV @-@ Ray to set a ray per pixel . if the difference between color values to the neighboring pixels with super @-@ sam@@ pling are processed . if you adjust the deep value to 4 , an array of 4x4 additional points is calculated with a deep value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the dy@@ es is divided the pre@@ defined thres@@ hold , then the pixels are divided into 4 sub @-@ values that can be followed individually and on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the record can be set with the repository .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that the generation of smok@@ es for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn it , changed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last pre@@ h@@ iring for quality of the ren@@ dering is diff@@ use ref@@ lex@@ ion . this is an experimental feature of a Pov@@ ray ; which comp@@ uted the diff@@ use of light flex@@ ion . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
in this map you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays are not an object .
opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ Con@@ soles . if &amp; Pov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this .
to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; select the menu entry file impor@@ ter ... and choose a file in dialogue window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the complete command of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; . when dealing with error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window shows a list of all messages .
if you don &apos;t want to support code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End .
you can export objects from the object in the editor to export the code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; it adds the sources of the object in the opened text file in the Editor . to import properties into the scene , simply select the source code in the Editor and drag it to the object tree .
with cop@@ ying and past@@ ing in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; also in your editor .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene is usually ren@@ dering . usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
if you click on help in the DIY @-@ view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user &apos;s documentation to the displayed object . place here the path to your document and the version . will support the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you will also need to enter the path to those files here . if a file is displayed in different paths of the library , the first discovered file is used .
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rectang@@ le for the field of view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type label .
you can adjust the item of the points to the R@@ aster in the context @-@ menu of the wire models . you can set the wheel separately for re@@ ps , scal@@ ations and scre@@ en@@ tions .
larger values give a more precise re@@ model , thus creating better approxim@@ ation for the indicated objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects like the ball you can set the detailed press for two directions separate .
when you cross the High Compon@@ ents for advanced projection , all wire models are further divided , if the camera uses an advanced projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions from the perspective and the sens@@ ing proj@@ ections . this property brings better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you indicated a wall , a wall is rolled behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a chess brake pattern from two adjustable colors .
when you map to the ground , a floor is displayed below the objects . the floor is shown in a box patterns of two adjustable colors .
when you activate the cant@@ ons , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ ased method is used for ren@@ dering the scenes . the values for depth and sw@@ elling can be set . accurate information about parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender @-@ modes .
this page allows you to change existing shut@@ ters or create new window regulations . in the section listing , explains how you can create window designs and save them .
the Com@@ bine foundation system module : displays all the existing shut@@ ters . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the selected window processing at the start of the program .
the list presence repository displays all existing shut@@ ters . a new arrangement can create you with the button Add , and delete a selected arrangement with the button removal .
each window system is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views of the chosen template . new views can be used with the button Add , and delete selected views with the button removal .
the position of the new window . with new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with its anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , with cardboard card , the view does not ens@@ hr@@ ined in the main window , but creates a separate window .
you have just installed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and now you want to start without more exact knowledge of the two programs . if you follow any steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene which is very popular : a bul@@ let on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings , before you make sure you use as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you set no camera , no rules can be applied to ren@@ dering , as a result you will receive a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark , and you only receive a black picture .
if you have everything error @-@ free , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following vo@@ re@@ ed panels :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar to learn . please read the documentation that you can expect an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their applications .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . in order to follow this guide , you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu bar Rest@@ art@@ ing . hence , you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you generate . specifically , in particular , you notice the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ dering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if they click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found in the user &apos;s documentation . see more details .
change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions , but note that the camera is in View control points , with which you can change the way@@ point of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a mouse point and drag it to the desired location .
when you apply the button or press the input modules , the wire model views and the object appears immediately corresponding to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to set the ground for the scene . you could fit for example a qu@@ ader ( insert the fin@@ ite body coll@@ ader ) and the size at x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a conc@@ ession method of solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; does indeed offer an simpler possibility . you can use an infinite level as the ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button below or the input paste . in the object @-@ tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now shows the level even if at the moment only a limited level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the layer extends up to the horizon .
if you look at the property tree exactly , you will find that you can le@@ ap the entry for the bottom , if you click on the different parameters for each new object : scale , rotation , and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit among the horiz@@ ont@@ ens so you get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows :
only select the ground to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but you can choose something simple in the moment .
in both cases , a dialog , in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . please select the name in the object @-@ tree view ( name = soil pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course , the preview of pig@@ ment is just one Matt@@ es black material , because you need to enter settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities , but now take the sim@@ pl@@ est .
if you preview not view color on the header and ball , then click on the button below and then call the preview .
the material for the soil is now properly set . if you are using your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following results :
of course , this is not the color that you anticipated . here are more settings necessary . in the color list , you will have to choose two new attributes list . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ bor@@ ary list can only be used with two colors ) :
select at the object tree jed@@ es@@ mal and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step should you be able to easily perform as you have understood the fundamental working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; already , the ball is just as easy as the floor to create :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . put the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget the input paste or the button to press ) , so the ball would float above the ground , since you move the soil to move down there .
of course , the ren@@ dering is now a strange result : as previously seen before , the ball sounds like a Matt@@ es black material . put in the following step a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now as@@ sign a material . as already in the ground , you give the ball a pig@@ ment as color :
select first ant@@ object and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ment . click on the sphere of pig@@ ment , then select one color and set the values as follows :
but you can reach interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features :
then change the values as in the following screens@@ hot and click to apply or push the input paste .
the settings she@@ en effect and ref@@ lex@@ ion gives already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ mium @-@ plated surfaces , even when metalli@@ c : not yet selected is :
you should now have a good idea of what options are you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully , you have already learned so much that you can do simple but beautiful scen@@ eries .
ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to generate a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you have a scene ray@@ trac@@ er , sho@@ ots the ren@@ derer hyp@@ othe@@ tical radiation from the perspective of the spect@@ ator ( d. h. by the camera , which is reflected and broken down , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmosph@@ eric effects have worked like for example m@@ ist . so the scene has been processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source , you also see nothing , the picture is just black . obviously , the image needs to be released , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you previously worked with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted in this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . it is a new file , you must enter a name and a space .
represents the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last date are saved .
this menu entry can only be selected if you do not yet stored any changes in the scene .
repe@@ ating the last und@@ one @-@ made command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have been using respon@@ ds back .
saves the current window system and opens a dialog , where you can enter a name for a new arrangement , or over@@ write an existing array .
in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the standard behaviour .
opens a dialog to change the short@@ cut short@@ cut . you can change sub@@ commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands change or add new commands .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove with this option lev@@ y icons for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands and remove commands .
a B@@ ump @-@ map is a way to pre@@ dispos@@ able surfaces , without any b@@ ump on the surface individually mod@@ elling and without the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself to change .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file both for a B@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture map .
basic properties are simple geomet@@ ric shapes you can use as components : very complex 3D models are made from do@@ zens or even hundreds of these basic objects . these models are then further processed to give them a realistic sense of appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base , using an image file as a color card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; convenient &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; picture concerned and browsers . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display . &quot; &quot; &quot;
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the picture or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can click with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the key will be displayed .
you can set whether any image should be displayed in an own window or whether all pictures will always be used to use the same window .
if you &apos;re looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ ename in the right @-@ hand corner . if an appropriate file field is found , the file is highlighted . you can leave the input field by return from return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in dialog setup - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , Common Market and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the other two , short command@@ ing for the browser , the short@@ cut can be specified for each window .
if this is selected then the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface is filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not a full screen mode .
this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still watch the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when finishing the name of the last opened folders . at the next start opens a button : this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored beams to choose a background color . this will be used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window , the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can add &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; to set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also represent the program .
with this option the display can be enlarged on the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determine if the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or the selected image .
the time lag between the image @-@ change in a slideshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ ders or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repet@@ itions . this value is set to 0 , the slideshow is until they dis@@ car@@ ded by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
modify the short@@ list for the different modes of work@@ book by &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the card @-@ card short @-@ cl@@ ing for the display and short @-@ command for the browser .
with this option you can switch between the two @-@ part viewing of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the un@@ favorable view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
displays large symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short introduction .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short introduction .
shows signs for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short introduction .
refer to the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
enlarged the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
does the sco@@ oter for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is also closed , if no browser window is open anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only sensible , if the automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first signs of the fil@@ ename you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is one &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photograph ) based on the &amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; image processing . &amp; show@@ foto ; is part of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ance ; project .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a quick picture editing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and make correc@@ tions and modifications .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ down ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute its part to having at least problems and potential improvements .
&amp; show@@ photo ; makes it as easy as possible errors or possible improvements to report . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry with a link . if you use this , your browser will open a page to reports of problems and wishes . all required information will be filled out and you can simply follow the guide to post your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; and hopefully soon we would like to answer questions of other users . in this mail@@ ing@@ list , however , English is spoken too , you should be powerful therefore .
the best start to join on &amp; show@@ photo ; is it the developer mailing list join . guidance for entering the developer Mail@@ ing@@ list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ foto : attempts to give you as much control over his work processes as possible . there are many options to access these settings , you have to select in the Sett@@ ings Sett@@ ings . you can switch between these settings within eight pages . you can switch between these settings by pressing on the icons to the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can choose the color that appears when the under@@ - or over@@ exposed indicators selected should display the colors with what you should see , in contrast . under@@ exposed a bright color and over@@ exposed a dark colour display .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; owns a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also see them in the editing . you can display them in which you click on one of the five riders on :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; is an application to dig@@ iti@@ zation of images that do not make more than images to scan and absor@@ b .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; is an easy application to scan images , which does not make more than images to scan and to store . &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; can save a dialog for stor@@ ing and display images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also save the images from posting too .
you can check the status of your scan display at the SAN@@ E project page by using the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be placed on the command line from &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ lite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; can be set in terminal . if this scanner was not opened or if no standard scanner was specified , then a dialog to choose the Sc@@ ann@@ ers will be opened .
the user can select the use scanner and OK to open the scanner . Canc@@ el will be &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ;
other settings contain more det@@ a@@ illed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not address these options .
to view an image , the user can only start a pre@@ p@@ aus@@ age and then start scanning Range for the final scan . the Vor@@ sch@@ aus@@ can be started through the preview button .
to select the image better , the user can easily pick the image inside and out of the current selection . he can also set the Zoom on that the complete preview fits into the window .
when the picture selected is selected then the final picture can be read with the scan button .
if In front of the stor@@ ing a preview is selected in the settings , then the image is displayed in a window window , as shown below is displayed . when saving , then the image will be saved and bow@@ ed ? en leads to a down@@ turn and you will get back to the main window .
through the button settings , the hom@@ onymous dialog is opened in front of the main window . you can change here the most important settings .
the user can view the image if desired , prior to the stor@@ ing . in this case , the option of stor@@ ing a preview is selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be chosen .
this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; sk@@ in@@ lite ; pictures save to select . dialog for stor@@ ing each image opens up the dialog before each sc@@ anned picture . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; these automatically set with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to choose the Save as a fil@@ ename .
this setting defines where images can be saved on the option saving without having a fil@@ ename . if the images are stored after any scan , this folder is used as default for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a picture @-@ fix for which automatically re@@ wind images and is moreover the proposed name for the image in the dialog to Save . the automatically saved picture gets a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix of each time gets up@@ loaded , when a picture is stored . the string # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adapt the image quality to save image quality . this value also changes the comp@@ ression only when you choose the image quality is not selected then the default value of Q@@ t is used .

you may need to set existing multimedia out@@ buttons so that they are working as a Amar@@ ok ; -@@ circuit commands . this makes your keyboard to the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which are mostly also available in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is supposed to describe the D@@ CO@@ P features of collection , context browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ list browser and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ CO@@ P @-@ function blu@@ ep@@ rint , such as :
Amar@@ ok supports the command@@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition , Amar@@ ok has still some own commands options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script should not be executed on account of a missing dependence . please check in your script if all required modules are available and take advantage of it , so that the user does not de@@ generate , why a script does not run .

in the folder scripts / Edition you will find a lot of template script in many different languages . they can use them as the basis for your own scripts , or simply add them to the required features . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts always interact with amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; , which should be attached to any KDE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the outs@@ ourcing of external programs and commands . to this end , the function ex@@ ec is used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively simply . here an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends messages to all running scrip@@ tures . for this reason scripts , scripts have continuously monitor their default version and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can even ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure displays the script to display the setting dialog . to edit the stor@@ ing and loading of the setting data , each script must take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the desktop folder onto the folder , where all data should be stored .
tr@@ ack@@ Change signal that a new piece is played . the script could now ask for example : with D@@ CO@@ P additional information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the du@@ ckl@@ ing ) .
vol@@ um@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ aled a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ize Set@@ ting : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le contains contains the path to the selected files in the play@@ list , if a user @-@ defined menu entry can be identified . to remove an entry again , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P @-@ function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Module ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok , the script stops , or if the user is stopping a script , sends the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to run such as Au@@ fr@@ aming . for example , e.g. the store of data or configuration settings .
Smo@@ ke script administration may also install script packages which can be downloaded from a web@@ server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ archives ( .t@@ ar ) , which can also be comp@@ ressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend a file name such as z.@@ n@@ bsp ; B. mean trans@@ duc@@ .@@ amar@@ oc@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; 1.3 can only accept Script packages with the Exp@@ and@@ ment script . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script packages right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to @-@ lad@@ der modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar @-@ parameter -@@ p to get the file &apos;s rights :
if your script is ready , you can charge it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and use the link to the Wiki pages page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; script should use the category Amar@@ ok ; script .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and still is surprisingly simple to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music to play@@ list instead of working through endless menus . perhaps you &apos;ll also search for a certain title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collec@@ tor &apos;s browser and the quick search results you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you would like to hear ? then the play@@ lists is just the right thing for you . and if you choose the decision is still hard to choose the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically determine the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P , and many general USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used , such as you want to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and fancy - just the right to experience your music !
usually , one has to input and install in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok &apos;s sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ob@@ ake , you should have no trouble downloading . if you still encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; eg ; Linux ) . for more information , please see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
Amar@@ ok needs only the package K@@ del@@ bs and otherwise no other KDE packages . you need to find K@@ all@@ bs ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have compiled a small guide on how to use K@@ del@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD pre@@ di@@ ct that your window managers will get the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ top@@ .org . G@@ NO@@ ME will function , for example , we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ all@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the t@@ agli@@ b library . you can see the file in@@ secure by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log . please report the broken file that cause the crash . after that , you can delete the file and let the collection again .
mostly it is that t@@ agli@@ b when reading the Met@@ a information cr@@ ashes from this file . please report this bug to the t@@ agli@@ b developer under bu@@ g@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries were compiled with the same compiler @-@ version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , then leads it to overthrow in the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d then de@@ activate automatic . switch off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace of e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a common thread , and you can send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs can write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ information , but not identified as Uni@@ code . the following Perl @-@ script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l die &quot; Die file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; I $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ day , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires Perl @-@ Module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PAN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos; .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / repet@@ ition / dynamic play@@ list ) see in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . this allows you to rec@@ ti@@ fy the Status De@@ activ@@ ates in Grau and semi @-@ transparent . please note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this setting displays their effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : Un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ ar ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check if Amar@@ ok is the correct Q @-@ library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ oc@@ app _ BAR _ gre@@ p Q@@ t .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or so , / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so adjust that Amar@@ ok is the correct version first .
there are some ways . most installation problems are easiest by using an expert on your Uni@@ xes or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or with the developers . they use the forum and IR@@ C below ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help with your help . please enter only one mistake when you get something on the dom@@ est@@ ing of an error in Amar@@ ok themselves .
after the start of &quot; Amar@@ ok , only a blank play@@ list appears . how will they come into music ?
this is easy . use the file &apos;s browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the Start window was transformed into the Statistik window . you will find it under extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : STARS stand for the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces must be displayed in the play@@ list of the play@@ list . click with the list page of the play@@ list and choose a column view . click somewhere in the new application column , to specify the evaluation for a piece . you can also use the short command@@ ing Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press Ent@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from the play@@ list menu .
drag a play@@ list file with the mouse into the play@@ list and let them drop exactly as you would do with other files . that &apos;s so easy : - )
in the tool@@ bar the play@@ list , right next to the Add @-@ button , is the button play@@ list . click on it .
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms de@@ vel and install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . take a look at lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find it via the tool@@ bar at extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that is really ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used one from the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question must be . world media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can support pretty much every single audio format . G@@ Stream@@ er can even test text and PNG !
it may ! perhaps use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will be supplied in Vo@@ ye@@ a no MP3 @-@ Dek@@ or with ( from pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ hat mp3 k@@ de , t@@ ass@@ ed
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stream@@ er driver using the AL@@ SA S@@ ink , the device must provide a Mix@@ er . a Mix@@ er allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously run out audio . this can be reached by a sound@@ card with hardware Mix@@ er ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA ( software mixing ) . view the Help D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the output of this command should help you in search of the problematic and a solution . for G@@ Stream@@ er you may need to provide a different S@@ ink ( e. g below ) .
this is doing &amp; Amar@@ ok , already . do not forget that media will first be de@@ co@@ ded . G@@ Stream@@ er is the best choice if you read a decade or with little over@@ head . G@@ Stream@@ er reads the file , de@@ co@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ co@@ ded the data first . G@@ Stream@@ er can output directly to AL@@ SA as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stream@@ er driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . please activate the sound server with highest priority ( warning , see the next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per SU@@ ID is set :
at KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs to cause the disturbed break . read this bug report . magnific@@ ation of the sound pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA branch file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either do not use the Arts driver but instead G@@ stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install KDE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the quicker Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized greatly for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts bu@@ ffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the bu@@ ffer , the less contracts respond to visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stream@@ er driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sometimes . why ?
after installing G@@ Stream@@ er you must register all the components . conduct G@@ ST @-@ register to register all G@@ reif@@ er components .
read the G@@ Stream@@ er FAQ . if that does not help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C Channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download Ver@@ m@@ pe@@ g Download , compile and install it . then run G@@ ST folder via G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer ( config ) and run G@@ ST @-@ register again . run by now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report under bu@@ g@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org. if you have a complete list of suggestions and wishes , send them best to our mail@@ ing@@ list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name does sound well . additionally , the name also contains the magical ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . place an alarm in your calendar program and let you run with the alarm this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok , which start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you &apos;ll be raised by the gentle tones of the music that you stopped in front of to bed .
how can we learn the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok , to learn current tracks when you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . diesel command gives you interpre@@ ting and title of the current piece : ssh -@@ I ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user dis@@ ser@@ ene Amar@@ ok player , player .
replace IP @-@ address with your IP and I@@ hr@@ us@@ ername with your us@@ ername . this requires that your identification is present in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok , window . pressing it on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open in an independent , in size variable window .
the combination of tr@@ l + right mouse button is a piece in the client order in qu@@ eue . through pres@@ sures of the input paste , after a search in the play@@ list , the first search results is played and the search is reset .
OK , the player window and the play@@ list have tricky functions , but what about the icon in the system size ?
click with the mouse button , click the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is situated on a NFS drive . according to the launch of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and on the console , many faul@@ ts appear .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you must hit ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok on a local drive , or use am@@ aro@@ v MySQL support .
insert the CD one , then click on the audio CD play@@ back . it opens up a file browser with multiple folders . you can switch to the wa@@ v file , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code , take off files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .

basically , this gives the previous assessment of an altern@@ ate value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece has been played , the less influence has on the overall result .
you can set the rating for a piece by clicking on a column head@@ line in play@@ list window . then mark the rating of one piece just as change , including all the other attributes , namely by clicking on the piece and Edit : rating or create F2 . you can also edit the review in dialog Met@@ adata .
the developers don &apos;t want to present you when you are to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means KDE packages have set up a fixed release plan that is not together with the short @-@ set plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users may well find also annoying . de@@ activate the option symbol to play in the general settings .
the analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select settings tool@@ bar , and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create an own . install this then under Amar@@ ok ...
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graph@@ ics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ y@@ .com ) to avoid difficulties , it was removed .
con@@ quer@@ or navigation range allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok , while in the Kon@@ quer@@ or brow@@ ses . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 around the navigation range . then click on the button Sett@@ lement of Ad@@ ding Amar@@ ok ;
audio cro@@ bb@@ ler is a free service to be sent to the information on which pieces will be played on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you only need a free user name and a password . Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ bb@@ ler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA @-@ versions have a lot of down@@ war@@ ts and therefore also caused a lot of bug reports .
supp@@ os@@ edly , &amp; Amar@@ ok , compiled before you installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine these output modules will not compile . you need &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok , new installed , but the output modules appear still not . and now ?
pres@@ um@@ ably you use a distribution that installed the development files separated from the actual program . although G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , the necessary development files are installed . the same goes for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine de@@ vel . afterwards , you need to compile and install .
I consider the error G@@ stre@@ er @-@ Crit@@ ical * * : factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stream@@ er has been compiled with boun@@ cing , that is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stream@@ er . you need to compile G@@ stre@@ amer without pre@@ m@@ ates . one tip from Mer@@ lin @-@ TC : Ver@@ wen@@ d@@ ne you do not compile two L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you have Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype au@@ dia / mp@@ 4 , although the module is g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stream@@ er , must be installed alongside g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad also the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time .
you will receive the mistake There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ etic adjusted audio / m@@ pe@@ g .
you play a MP3 @-@ stream , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then lead you as system supplier G@@ ST @-@ register . then you start Amar@@ ok new .
I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can the Amar@@ ok use the second sound@@ card ?
under Sett@@ ings Amar@@ ok You set the device . typical for example h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
place in the setting dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio one , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , activate the tick on sound@@ card supports m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio edition with Arts will not be further followed . you must naturally take this problem yourself into the hand ! if you like , you can get the new much needed coordin@@ ator for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup assistant who would like to upgrade your collection , or the assistant simply don &apos;t like , then this rapid start @-@ guidance will be a help . with her help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
creating a play@@ list is very simple . drag the menu entries into the play@@ list . the small text box to the fil@@ tering the collection facilit@@ ates you the search for certain pieces . if you are happy with the play@@ list , you can save it with the play@@ list play@@ list , so you can save this button in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list window .
if you have your own play@@ list , you can add them to the play@@ list . if the play@@ list is included in the folder of your collection , these play@@ lists are already enabled in the list of play@@ lists . with a right click on a play@@ list you will find different ways to play@@ list the play@@ list .
to play an audio CD , select the audio CD recording in the menu bar . it opens up a file browser with multiple folders and the CD @-@ pieces in WAV format . simply drag the WAV files in the play@@ list and then press the button @-@ play .
the audio CD feature uses the protocol audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the play@@ list . just click with the right mouse button on an entry and follow the name menu . you have here different ways to burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok , the installation of some software packages pre@@ di@@ ments . the required packages are listed below . furthermore , some additional packages are listed , working with &amp; Amar@@ ok . more convenient .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or ap@@ t ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok , is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as each normal multimedia player also has a play@@ list with the most important features . additionally , a play@@ list contains several browsers that can record your entire music collection and search through .
in this chapter , explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , are used , including creating a collection and a play@@ list .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window there is a regular text display which displays the current piece or current stream on current stream . directly below , the section , the game time , bit@@ rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current tune will see . a click on that section changes the time &apos;s time @-@ up time to the remaining time of the piece .
furthermore , the player window provides a selection of audio @-@ methods , also among the rolling text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking on the links below .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press the on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will be displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
under the rolling text display , the buttons are PL and E@@ Q . the kno@@ PL is enabled or dis@@ ables the play@@ list window , while the button E@@ Q is used to set up the E@@ quali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the play@@ back @-@ buttons , the volume @-@ strength and the piece @-@ positions sli@@ ders . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the piece @-@ position or the volume . using the reproduction buttons , you can launch the play@@ back / stop and move to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audi@@ ot@@ ri@@ ers . there are 17 pres@@ ets from Classic to Tech@@ no , and you can easily create own preferences .
to display the E@@ quali@@ zer , you can use extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the button E@@ Q in the Player window . once you mark the cross@@ road E@@ quali@@ zer , the E@@ quali@@ zer is in operation .
the play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most developed play@@ list of all available for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that there is no other player in no other player . but let yourself not be deter@@ red by the wealth of features , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ list window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the play@@ list . in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent features of play@@ list , such as the context @-@ browser . on the right there is the play@@ list itself . the play@@ list is easy to use and yet even advanced users powerful enough .
the context @-@ browser displays various information regarding the current quantity . its appearance can be customized with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ters . these three sub@@ windows are later explained in detail . they provide information about the current piece of different aspects .
if you already have earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might find that the under@@ window is dropped into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . besides , the information provided in the statistics window will be collected ( extras statistics ) .
the sub@@ window of music shows information about the current play , as well as the songs and the album .
the first section in this under@@ window shows information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , interpre@@ ter and the album . here , see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this symbol to hit the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find further information on the current piece . you see here , how often and when the piece was performed for the first and last time as well as his assessment .
to view cover images in the context of your browser , the cover images are displayed in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g will be supported , but pictures with the word front can be preferred in the name . the context browser displays also cover images , which were either downloaded with the cover @-@ administration or are embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 @-@ tags .
the next section , Rec@@ ommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces on . if you click on one of these pieces , it will immediately play@@ back .

you can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start immediately start playing . you can also click with the right mouse button on it and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the play@@ list .
in the bottom text , the downloaded Li@@ ed@@ text is displayed on the running piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download the text to writing scripts . once you click on the text window , try to download the text for the piece from the internet . if you don &apos;t run a text script , you can choose which to start running .
the kno@@ b button allows you to edit the text text . the altered version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . this is not a run text script needed .
the kno@@ ck @-@ button opens a search on google.com after the lyrics for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group Inter@@ pre@@ t - group only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpre@@ ter . albums or gen@@ res are left out there .
group@@ ing Inter@@ pre@@ t / Album - first , the pieces will be sorted by interpre@@ ter and under@@ ne@@ ath a further division for the respective album . if you want to watch con@@ stell@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view on your collection - these albums are shown on the start of the list under various interpre@@ ters .

group@@ ing album - all albums of your collection are alphab@@ e@@ tically sorted among each other . the interpre@@ ter will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / Inter@@ pre@@ t - your pieces are first sorted by genre and below to the interpre@@ ter .
group@@ ing genre / Inter@@ pre@@ t / Album - this setting works just like the above , but is additionally ordered by album below the interpre@@ ter .
with the aid of the remaining buttons , you can custom@@ ize and combine the group@@ ing entirely to Bel@@ i@@ eben .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; your collection will automatically re@@ produce as soon as you can change something at selected folders . if you own many pieces , this could take a while .
directly below the tool@@ bar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view and in the belly @-@ sight . evidence of how this filter is available in the section on the play@@ list in this manual .
under the search filter is a selection , with whose help you can see the least added pieces to your collection , starting from the last 24 hours to a year . besides , you can of course select your overall collection , making the filter virtually off .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following options .
download - This is the current play@@ list and adds the selected pieces at the currently valid order in playing .
to play@@ list posts - Add the selected pieces of the current play@@ list . by placing a double @-@ click on an entry you can achieve the same effect .

the play@@ list browser shapes the use of many play@@ lists . among other things he also contains intelli@@ gently play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ list browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for the time . the smart play@@ lists are composed of :
never played : a play@@ list with the pieces in your collection that never played before .
even if intelli@@ gently rend@@ itions are possible . click the intelli@@ gently play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new intelli@@ gently play@@ list . there you will be able to enter all the necessary criteria for your new play@@ list .
the sub@@ window media player is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok , with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , it has to be involved in the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok , you will find the pieces to be sorted into your iPod by interpre@@ t in the top list of media player brow@@ sers .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the play@@ list and drop them on the list interpre@@ ter . therefore , the pieces will be up@@ loaded onto your iPod . if the transfer is completed , you exit them &amp; Amar@@ ok , and solve the disk operator for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar is a search area that you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file lists all files will be hidden , which do not comply with your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser is a address bar with which you can pick music from a given URL . if you like to download the music from a given URL , you can copy and paste the input modules , you can play music in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ gz . now you can drag the music from there to play@@ list and drop the play@@ list .
if the play@@ list is longer than in the window is , the An@@ hang of files by simple case can be difficult . in the case the F@@ esth@@ ood of the Shift key will be helpful : thereby , the closed files will automatically added at the end of the list , and not in the position position .
the play@@ list contains all of you attached to the play@@ back pieces . you can edit the sequence using the mouse where you can enter a filter . once you enter there letters , the letters are included . to reset the letters , you press for as long as the button down , until the text box is empty again .
if you enter separate search words by blan@@ ks , will contain Amar@@ ok ; according to entries they contain all search terms . if you enter e.g. one two three , the search will find all entries that one , two and three are included .
if you enter between the search terms , will be sent to entries which either contain either one or the other search term . for example : one OR two or three . in this example , all pieces will be found that one or two or three are included ( or a combination of them ) .
if you want to search for in@@ comes the spaces are included , then turn the search term with ge@@ ese : Mike Old@@ field . therefore , according to entries , the Mike Old@@ field will not include , but by entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for mos@@ quit@@ oes , which have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , please make a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for mos@@ quit@@ oes , which is something not included .
you can combine this syn@@ tax@@ type in accordance with each other . for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 - comment : bath . this searches for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 and not include the comment bad .
you can specify the play@@ list of entries by pressing the tr@@ l button , and then click with the right mouse button in the desired order click the entries . the entries will then be given a marking with a number . the number matches the order in which the pieces will be re@@ produced .
the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the play@@ list . on the left you can find the button Add to which you can insert play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list and random@@ ly me@@ tic .
next , the buttons are to be revers@@ ed and re@@ produce . there@@ with you can make changes to the play@@ list re@@ versible or restore .

the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you can display in the player window above the right mouse button . through this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration setup .
there are still many other available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example play@@ back controls and speakers . you can set the indicated buttons by clicking on the menu and select the tool@@ bar .
the stat@@ us@@ bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on play@@ list . it displays the title of the current song , the number of pieces and the total play of all pieces . furthermore , the status for down@@ force and the playing time of the current song is displayed simply by clicking with the mouse twice in the relevant ad area .
you can also use the stat@@ us@@ bar code . to make sure you check the bar status bar in the general settings .
the context menu has a click with the right mouse button in the Player window , or by clicking on the play@@ list on the menu . this menu allows you to reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
a click on this entry will open the window Visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry a sub @-@ menu signed with links to this document and other information on Amar@@ o@@ K .
the cover management is a useful tools to manage your cover images . you can launch them by selecting actions Cover in the Collection browser .
the cover management contains a list of list of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpre@@ ter in your collection by selecting the interpre@@ ter on the left side .
with the menu view you can choose what should be displayed in the cover management . select from :
the qu@@ eu@@ es management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok , 1.3 . with this feature , you have to have more control over the play@@ list . after you have set a piece in the qu@@ eue , appears in the play@@ list one number next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
the maintenance of qu@@ eue open up for extras qu@@ eu@@ es management . if you want to add a piece in the play@@ list , select the piece in the play@@ list and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces with the mouse or the context menu in the play@@ list . the order of the pieces can then change in the qu@@ eue .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ given ( the details of the set up of these follow later ) .
fill your play@@ list with random pieces from your entire collection and adds while playing further random pieces .
adds pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( earlier : Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ bb@@ ler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your play@@ list . you need not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile so that this dynamic play@@ list works .

e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to launch CD and automatically re@@ produce all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method , recently opened projects to load once again . the sub @-@ menu includes a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been stored , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise you will be asked for a new fil@@ ename .
saves the current project under a new fil@@ ename . KDE &apos;s Dialog Save Target is displayed that you can choose folder and fil@@ ename for the project @-@ file .
saves all ground@@ ed projects . this is the same when you would call for every single project file saving .
includes the current project . if a project has changed and not yet been stored , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; according to what should be done . you can then break between memory and changes . also , you can break down and keep the project so open .
closing all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will in@@ quired for each saved project , what should be done , just as if you were called for each project file closing .
closing all opened projects and finishes &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for each saved project , what should be done , as if you have called the closing session .
if you call this entry you can choose via the apparent dialog files to add to the project . that has the same effect when you log files directly from the top view into the project . if the current project is a data CD , the files appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above . what is the ? -@@ Help available ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears when using an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this is useful when you put files in a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you use files for a multi @-@ file session . it &apos;s useful for you to see if this function is not used for you , so that you can already see existing files and folder on the medium .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function allows &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files do not exp@@ ire from the medium , it only ends the files imported previously .
opens the CD head@@ ing dialog . this also allows without project @-@ file the copy of a CD onto another medium . alternatively , you can also just burn just an image from a CD , which you can then burn later on . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal cop@@ ying . you should have clar@@ ification , if you want to copy CDs using def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copy of a DVD to another medium . this also allows you to burn just an image of a DVD , which you can then burn later on . besides , there is also the possibility of losing a DVD using the cop@@ ying dialogue is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to the form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialog , you can form@@ ulate a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you write the choice between write to write and incre@@ mentally .
bur@@ ns a previously un@@ stell@@ ate CD @-@ picture . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data , which can then be used immediately through the g@@ aps of the burning bone . ( N@@ eros * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , so you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
bur@@ ns a previously calculated DVD image . the dialog calls you for a * .@@ iso -@@ file as a source of data source , which can then be burned down by pressing the bu@@ ck button .
a previously generated DVD Video can be transformed . thereby , this dialogue window appears usually after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used instead . it contains information about the extrac@@ ted video , co @-@ ordin@@ ances and even possibilities for changing the size and for cutting black edges .
displays information about the occasi@@ onal media . this information is displayed in the content view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and titles in the CD or DVD .
shows a list of the tool@@ bar of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small lo@@ ste is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
folding the folder view , or out . the folder view is an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content is activated , its content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with features such as media Info , locks and un@@ lock of the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium .
switching the ingredients view one or out . the content view enables the selection and drag files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
swit@@ ched back to the project view one or out . the header bar is a narrow scope , which is only visible when the project view includes open projects . the header bar has no real function , it looks just pretty , and separ@@ ates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this will open a dialogue window to change the buttons for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after having one of the available commands in the upper part , one can adapt the ke@@ yp@@ to to it further down .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assistant . thus , the correct entit@@ lements can be adjusted to the burning of CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator is required , therefore , you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here you can set general program settings . nearly all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work towards th@@ ief . this dialog is for person@@ alisation and host@@ ility of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; it is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , using a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled through a shell scripts .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions to use , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or which some more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the function@@ scope , therefore more likely your taste and the type of your task is vital , which the accompanying programs you give to .
in this chapter we assume that you use the Command system d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions , you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; start . then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions which have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program according to , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; functions as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for generating new projects .
Na@@ om@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ Type ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ B@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ A@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) _ COP@@ 3@@ d ( ) _ COP@@ 3@@ d ( ) _ COP@@ 3@@ d ( ) void ) ( Kur@@ l ur@@ l ) ( Kur@@ l ur@@ l ) ( Kur@@ l ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ Ass@@ Project method , you can create a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly generated project : D@@ COP@@ Ref ( K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project _ Audi@@ oc@@ d ) and then get a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface curr@@ ent@@ Project Th@@ rough wir@@ ing this reference it is possible to change the project over K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is only applicable on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ string flags ) ( cur@@ l ur@@ l , Q@@ string flags ) $ set@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ string path ) ( Q@@ string path ) ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string path )
so it &apos;s possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then adds files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface mod@@ ate@@ Data@@ Type ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT p@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / foo d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / some@@ fil@@ e.@@ t@@ xt / foo / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ trigger for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it a simple audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , according to en@@ coder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; is the user interface from c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD files in WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many co@@ di@@ ers ( comp@@ ressed comp@@ ression ) . currently , l@@ ame is supported for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for OG@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( ver@@ sive comp@@ ression ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the machine ( stored and comp@@ ressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per heading ) comp@@ ressed in the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or also in other formats like the los@@ sy FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must now be done .
for the second step should l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ erer already exist , it is therefore very likely not necessary to compile something yourself . however , only the Ko@@ di@@ erer packages will be installed , which is not used for instance FLA@@ C , its installation is also not required .
which code @-@ format / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ erer , Audio Quality and Com@@ pressed Fac@@ tors .
a word to cop@@ ying of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ ences ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the protection of the audio data from the &amp; CD . if not the firmware of the copy , it is not possible to get a protected audio CD ; even though not the mechanisms of cop@@ ying ? simply avoid the purchase of Cop@@ ier @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while fil@@ ing only needs to be done ( setting up dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is needed ) , the daily handling towards reading a &amp; CD ; on the hard disk will explain . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the sl@@ ender approach of the user interface , about which you can often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ ded programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; collect information from the free@@ DB from the Internet or can work fully without a network being captured manually .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example you will find further information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
will the CD@@ DB request to collect the CD@@ DB data according to the installation of query in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must first be made . )
starts the read and - if a en@@ coder is con@@ figured in the tab tab in the inaugur@@ ation catalog - the co@@ ding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with a different en@@ coder than the standard . it &apos;s note that before the en@@ coder is con@@ figured in the tab tab in the setting dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already chosen file is chosen for co@@ ding instead of a complete &amp; CD ; to download and ex@@ pose .
opens the dialog dialog to configure the type of not@@ i@@ fications ( like proto@@ cols , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programming events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; completed ) .
opens the main@@ setting dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; with different map maps ( like Encoder , to setup the En@@ co@@ ders ) . afterwards , you must go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter outlines ton quality , enco@@ ders and comp@@ ression rates , and helps you to choose the right code .
if no audio information is to be lost , a ver@@ ting free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; hormones , or &apos; monkey &apos; that may possibly be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low comp@@ ression rates and hardly available commercial devices that these files can be re @-@ imported .
under the audio formats , the information generated by data comp@@ ression depending on its p@@ sycho@@ acou@@ st@@ ical model , MP3 and O@@ GG requires a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but about this bit@@ rate , the differences are less important since both co@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality .
o &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality for deeper Bit@@ ters .
O@@ GG - if only music is heard from a computer or a machine @-@ based music system , and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG devices are available .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto @-@ stereo installations . today - in the beginning 2009 - these devices usually support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting composition of the &quot; l@@ ame &quot; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &quot; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = this setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer increased transparency for most people and most of the music pieces of acceptable transparency and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereotyp@@ es with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , comp@@ ression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereotyp@@ es with high quality . this is the preferred option .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , comp@@ ression rate about 5.5 . needs more and 256 k@@ bps for complex and fewer complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereotyp@@ es with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R common stereo , comp@@ ression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a tit@@ el . good enough for music by you@@ ths , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ o@@ systems . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereotyp@@ es .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most persons and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information collected manually or by the program automatically fet@@ ched from the free@@ DB via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ oph@@ ator ; and the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er@@ programm to generate the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with enco@@ ding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
e.g. about the keywords ; title to the keywords , when MP@@ 3@@ s are co@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch is w@@ tt from l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; added . the result is like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oph@@ ers ; parameters that can be used ( = Kno@@ ck @-@ drawing in the assist@@ ants ) :
this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , where people can read the audio CD containing information , so that all the other information may be downloaded instead of itself in the calcul@@ ator . it is note that here only of text spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not of the audio file itself .
yes it should be legal , but I am supposed to be legal , but I am not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; any more or less worth@@ less , so either the artist can still harm the music company anymore . all information can anyway be given at a stroll through a &amp; CD ; shop , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; is active a approach to choose ( sending a address ) . for the use of free@@ DB can be used with a different ( f@@ ake ) address as the specified in the system . this type of configuration is not used ( This can only be the programmer who checked the code . )
in many countries there are copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; if &amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; for use of free@@ DB , the geographic area is to be used in the next table . this saves band@@ width in the network and compar@@ es the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org delivers a current list of reflection on the on @-@ line call of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which outs@@ ourcing program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to know exactly , seeking in source code ... This has always been the best choice for reading Audio @-@ CD ; s. to consider that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package needs to be installed from the suitable distribution first if this is not yet done .
for stor@@ ing the WAV files , the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be chosen and therefore the desired file format . in the first opening , there are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( OG@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a ver@@ sive comp@@ ression for audio data ) on the tab . other Ko@@ di@@ erer can be added to this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer Package must be installed on the Linux distribution , before the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ erer . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer is in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a code , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ sol@@ der window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . here , it must be replaced by the name of the installed body .
this can have many causes . check the installation of the device drawing of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and reading process , and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio @-@ enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for OG@@ Gs , f@@ lac &amp; etc ; ) . try to give both programs using a command line in a terminal . that &apos;s an indication of what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is one chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , everything understood , but somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by example , and you will get enough information to set out those areas exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , everything setup and our first &amp; CD . we will l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to use MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ word ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . an appropriate package for l@@ ame may be found as it is not completely free software . at least , it is not necessary to compile files which you can naturally always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have one of them ( eg ; by trying to copy with the counter @-@ section ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; , something that will probably be done once and
the second section describes how to proceed to read a &amp; CD , what needs to be repeated as a CD .
here we determine the use of co@@ gen@@ res for comp@@ ression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . as we are used where the files are stored and which structure is used to use the free@@ DB to download the free@@ DB files to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change it with any case of a CD . change even if the appropriate settings are found .
the de@@ sign@@ ment is transferred to the read@@ out program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
frequently , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real de@@ device drawing of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , it helps a view to the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
map Universal Sett@@ ings . here gi@@ b@@ ts do not have much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be as bel@@ low as shown in the screens@@ hot .
only for complete information can be found so that you will be notified if statements regarding the ren@@ dering of keywords ( tags ) are missing .
map CD ; settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the computer must be connected while reading the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet , so that it can access the free@@ DB server .
the second release field is easier , a &amp; CD included , begins immediately after reading the &amp; CD ; it &apos;s later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory name / fil@@ ename or day entries , they can easily changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 @-@ tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , further notice : if you want to manually enter everything manually , check out the selection fields and free@@ DB will not be used . however , this more than 620 MB large , consider this to be worthwhile . in order to use free@@ DB in the offline mode , the two choices must be selected at least the first one . the mode is set up on the following cardboard card .
CD@@ DB is a free@@ DB for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ ev@@ ing the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB servers via the Internet . how do you know the system you want to get the CD ? read everything as it is shown in the screens@@ hot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB servers : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look for a mirror server in your vicinity . however , the load is distributed among the hosts . however , this setting will work as a first attempt .
both function equally equivalent to the server as though many Fire@@ wall the protocol 88@@ 80 standard@@ ly bo@@ cker , there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually is open to surf on the internet .
in this example , we do not want to submit a &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server should enable the first cross@@ roads .
simply take the settings from the screens@@ hot . ( make sure that the folder / t@@ mp exists on your computer )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cover at the same time : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time when using only one existing drive ? Parall@@ el@@ ded reading and co@@ ding ? the author knows it , therefore just trying to try . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD ; after reading the final piece , I cross it to release the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you need this tick , then / must be stored in the folder / folder in which the WAV files is not indicated , the field is not indicated , if you want to make your files in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to make something with the WAV files .
everything as input it is on the screen foto . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be broken down to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good hi@@ fi stereotyp@@ es . the resulting bit@@ rate is average approximately 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved comp@@ ression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of creating tags at version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; Day for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change to tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screens@@ hot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of WAV files in WAV files : with Dual@@ Core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to ex@@ pose more than an WAV file at the same time .
that is it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; completed . this configuration is used as standard for each read of a CD . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change them again .
in this section , the process of reading the &amp; CD is described on the hard drive . we will build MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is built on the hard disk , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB shall be described , and the process of the free@@ former has to be described in this section , must be repeated for each correc@@ tive &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in free@@ DB , you will see the screen photos a little different from the one &amp; CD ; with successfully shown by free@@ DB files . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually insert it from the internet . comments are found on the differences .
try not the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this has not yet happened , now the &amp; CD has to be defined in the drive , which has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , just as in the screens@@ hot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD , could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then you may search in the section questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
note : if the &amp; CD was successfully fet@@ ched from the free@@ DB , all the titles of the pieces have already been completed and are also shown the artist &apos;s name and album .
in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; gives a window appears , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ;
if you do not have the log@@ ged field for automatic read@@ ings of free@@ DB ( on page &amp; CD ) , you can also manually trigger this through choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but you need to fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD @-@ Data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen foto . the title of the song in the first line of the input field &apos; Cur@@ rent title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist should no longer be given in the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual Property &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ ell per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful recall of the data from the free@@ DB , the CD @-@ editor will not be empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD Ed@@ itors , so that you are not only satisfied with the artist &apos;s and album names ( e.g. if all words with large letters are beginning or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example we use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ tags . this limited the length of fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the commentary area . if you set ID@@ 3@@ v2 tag , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ oph@@ ator ; maximum allowed . this option is set on the tab tab .
you can change the day information of the generated files later anytime by day editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags new .
tags are not supported by all Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers or file formats . see the help of the Ko@@ di@@ erer to find more information .
simply select one entry , which obviously matches the style of the exc@@ use CD ; matches . in this example , this is not important as we have the &amp; CD ; -@@ data will not transmit it . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap such as Pop or R@@ ap can be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editors will be back and you see that the fields marked for the album already filled with the data that we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the current song . the song of the piece is on any case and other information you desire .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have posted all the Tit@@ anium data of the &amp; CD .
note : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB file . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
this is the third button of the tool@@ bar . please note that the artist and the album are displayed about the item .
note that it has a check @-@ sign before each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked are out . a simple click on the line indicates the selection of the piece , or add the button All pieces selected at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at once .
was started by clicking on the chosen button . then , this window will be confirmed . click OK and then we will have a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
click on the tab orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently being read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message you can see if you &apos;re trying to work with a stove that you have not installed . pieces that have not been successfully co@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list marked .
inci@@ dentally , the folder for the t@@ mp file and the target folders are not what we have given here in example . did you check whether you have to access the folder for the temporary files and the target folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece out , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the co@@ ding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read out the status message in the lower part of the window , it &apos;s now improved .
the author of the program has found no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing can be con@@ figured is the result is un@@ clear . the used machine with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and co@@ ding ( from however two different poles ) .
now the final song is read , while another piece is co@@ ded , and a third order is co@@ ded in the qu@@ eue of the body . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window is embedded with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create comp@@ ressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the Ko@@ di@@ erer of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; will chat today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S will maintain a pre @-@ compiled package , since most distri@@ butions are already included , as a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ package is . install the package bub@@ bly material from your distribution . if you &apos;re reading this , you probably already did it ...
this section is directed to individuals who are compiled by source files and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are searching for assistance such as the program can be adapted to your needs when it runs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls up many different programs , has many variations of settings . best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of different map modes of settings and also contains comments for options that are not used for example .
Hi , still reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked according to the first time the program is cli@@ cked , without any cl@@ ue as it would go on from that somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what &apos;s going to ? who does this , have probably already started the program . it should look something like that :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain or change this manual . it is considered the first version of a manual too &amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; thought . who also always do something us@@ efulness plus change , may it do . at least after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he declared this section and is therefore dis@@ agree with this suggestion .
strange , if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these Inform@@ ations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Car@@ a@@ ok@@ ot@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; . beside others he does not have real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ ao@@ ke real @-@ time high@@ lighting , also some properties that have other &amp; UNIX ; MIDI Player not .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Support will work . &amp; C@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und proj@@ ector , which is needed for the CIS . AL@@ SA is included as soon as there is a sequence .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with altern@@ ating paint so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI can@@ als by high@@ lighting the op@@ pres@@ sive keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can move into &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to the Mid @-@ Level .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( body events or text events ) . K@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used .
session support . if you want &amp; k@@ de ; during the play@@ time of a song , K@@ mid starts again with the same song again for the next time .
supports external MIDI using synth@@ esizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P drivers and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select opening ... from the menu file . it will be the usual file dialog with which you can choose the song you want .
you can also let a file of a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window in the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window will drop . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and bet@@ tering the kno@@ w@@ bar in the tool@@ bar , choose the entry to play from the menu piece or pressing the le@@ f@@ ash .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will start automatically , once you draw it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window will pull . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then re@@ played down@@ ward . )
once Sch@@ k@@ mid ; a play plays , you can jump to any one place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the template . to get back the original pace , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the le@@ ash has two tasks : if a piece is re@@ played , a pressure on the le@@ dge appears as a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry into the menu , then inter@@ rup@@ ting the play@@ back . pressing the bu@@ c@@ aste during no play will start , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the reproduction .
lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces will use text event , others use lyrics , and another both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events are to be shown and even better : the event type will automatically detect that a song is used . so if you choose not to manually set the pop text messages in the menu settings . however , you have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to set a single event type , select from the menu settings the entries text events and loung@@ ing events . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files you can summar@@ ize . these will be played in the series following . in this section you can use collections effectively .
to set a collection , you open at the collectors &quot; collection . this will find you in the menu collection under the item . click New and give the name to the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on cop@@ ying and then indicate the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the cur@@ f@@ eit im collectors &quot; event .
in the temporary collection all the songs you want to do not want to add any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . concerns that if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collectors &quot; collection . there , you can add a song to the button . it appears in again the file dialog , with whose help you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on setting an automatic transmission to the collection .
when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece by opening ( under use of file open , or drag &amp; drop ) automatically added to the active collection .
when Autom@@ atically adding to the collection not activated , the opening of a piece is activ@@ ates the temporary collection and extrac@@ ted . this collection will then be added to the open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collector &apos;s collection , select the collection and desired song and then click on del@@ etes .
you can select the sequence in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence in order from the sub@@ menu of the menu , the songs are shown in sequence , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove any random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in collecting , or use the selection list above the kar@@ ao@@ ke text .
to jump to a song , choose the button next song , the entry next song from the menu or press the button arrow right .
to jump back off a song , choose the kno@@ w@@ area previous item , the entry dict@@ ate sli@@ ce from the menu or press the left arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collector &apos;s collection , select the collection del@@ eting collection there and click the button Clear .
the temporary collection can not be deleted however , however , that does not play a role as it is in the release of &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is absolutely necessary for synth@@ esizer , that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI Map General @-@ MIDI @-@ events translated into events that understands the synth@@ esizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI Map , which conver@@ ts all the events of the Change Patch to B@@ right Piano in Events of the Change Patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and therefore always leaves a trumpet if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound@@ card , you do not need a MIDI Map , because all the Sound@@ cards are GM -@@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM @-@ devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI Map is a text file , which stores all necessary settings for the play@@ through of a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . prerequisite for this is , however , that each appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ fine PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... END De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A further key@@ map &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; END De@@ fine CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... END Women ... END
you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for options ) and END that the end of a section is achieved .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be offered for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section , the pat@@ ches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard may be de@@ duc@@ ted . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equ@@ ator will be ignored . it &apos;s believed that the GM -@@ pat@@ ches in the correct order are ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional Th@@ key@@ s@@ To M is needed to place all notes that need this instrument to lay at the tone with the number M . if your keyboard drives a gun ( for example with Ton 60 ) , which allows you to t@@ oss a drum , e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
therefore , if a MIDI file should play a touch with patch 127 ( sh@@ red@@ ress ) , it takes patch 100 ( the Drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , irrespective of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term Drum patch the patch is meant that each sound is another Per@@ k@@ ussi@@ on@@ sin@@ ful instrument ( Drum , pel@@ vis , Mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one who mean sound the ton@@ ing of the always identical allo@@ y ( like him some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to specify , like notes on a specific channel or instrument .
as with PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you must therefore create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for every channel and tool . you only need to use different names only in the first line .
key@@ maps are used primarily to form notes on the per@@ k@@ ite channel . take a look at the included key@@ maps .
this section can be used to convert some channels to others . if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel , you just make it the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion to a particular channel ( general MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi @-@ devices need 16 channels , CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , number@@ ed from 0 to 15 , and up according to the following patterns :
n is the channel , which is needed to form the channel . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map will naturally be defined in the file . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , whenever Patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to getting the per@@ k@@ ite patch on the per@@ k@@ ite channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ Rati@@ o indicates that the command Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender @-@ Event multip@@ lied with the value n , this with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) is re@@ counted and then only passed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the Map file no dec@@ im@@ al@@ command@@ as are available ) .
this setting is needed , because GM proposes that a keyboard , which should play a pitch @-@ B@@ ender @-@ event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a tone higher . unfortunately , however , try some key@@ boards to play two sounds up to an oc@@ t@@ ave higher . to try to try the correct value on your keyboard , you will need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI Map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings
the cann@@ ula view is a window with a whole series of piano dri@@ fts ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these piano , you see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the edge view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer use the original instrument .
the se@@ aling view has ( until now ) two different views to display the sounds . in view , select Sett@@ ings Sett@@ ings under the point of channel view : settings
the speed @-@ LCD displays the speed in which a song is re@@ played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . so , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down it . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and to the right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that has to be played like a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , etc . . this allows the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
good , I can comp@@ el anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 Mb . with a MIDI file you can also change the single instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a bin@@ ary ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support was compiled to fix the issue and install ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos; s Home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually .
to do so , supports &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . simply open the folder that you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
first , you will necessarily enable the setting of an automatic add to the collection . otherwise , the files in the temporary collection will be added .
you can taste the arrow @-@ button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow the play . to re@@ produce the default tempo , click on the LCD double button .
I have on one &amp; k@@ de ; work@@ space a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI File and &amp; k@@ mid ( if I want to play a MIDI file lock ) , or if I want to play a file , simply drag a file , merely move into the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; move window and draw the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you want to listen to a file just quickly without adding them to a collection , turn the setting of automatic transmission to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you only want to play the first file . so , setting up an setting an automatic transmission to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then un@@ lock you , also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . all thank you so much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , animated me that , further on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from ma@@ iden ; Ne@@ ar . at the moment I am in the third year , so I &apos;m not much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a little time . as a hobby , I have program , MIDI files , music make and phr@@ ases .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ ao@@ ke files if you want to have a question about an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ y@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make a huge fre@@ ew , if you send me a postcard from your home location or MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ ao@@ ke file from a local group . all who want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will send you to friends by &amp; k@@ mid ; ( if you want to send me a MIDI file , but you should contact me since I might have the file .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and nobody was swe@@ pt by anyone for making money . I therefore want to empha@@ size that I only do so on program@@ mi@@ ere because / if I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ w@@ ai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - En@@ er@@ sion of the bug that was high @-@ height at A@@ we cards .
my thanks also applies Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for the Test@@ ing of the CIS support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Marc Di@@ ef@@ enb@@ ru@@ ch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , a troub@@ les@@ hip or even just a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail .
and of course my thanks also applies to all those excellent musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ ao@@ ke files .
in addition , you can find &amp; k@@ mid ; also on his homepage , which is found under ht@@ tp : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .ht@@ ml . on the homepage you can also follow the development , information and look at the pictures . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ ao@@ ke bars , etc .
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external synth@@ esizer , as the sound quality depends on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same if you use a FM device or a ax@@ we card .
if you do not have sound@@ card , you must compile &amp; c@@ mid ; using the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then goes as if you could have a sound@@ card , except that you can &apos;t hear music of course .
if trouble occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail list or send an error directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ pe@@ g . the program is used to play video files used by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet ended than a bed ; it was installed on this computer .
for further assistance to send the site The KDE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . it always gives the window with the play@@ list . and finally there is a window display window , which is only then displayed when information is re@@ written in it .
it is possible to set up the preferred compounds under the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category of Dau@@ gh@@ ty play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an extra hierarch@@ ical network . if you enter an entry , his group and all its sub @-@ groups for the current category will be copied and the play@@ back begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; actual piece &apos; , television and Dau@@ cus play@@ list may also be modified by direct edit the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do when selecting a editor , but also by using the application itself . simply click on a name of a category cli@@ cken from the menu view and next to the cli@@ pping a sub@@ group is shown only the XML content of this part .
after changing XML files , the menu has to be selected from the menu with play@@ list and choose either the processing mode , or selected another category .
all changes are lost when the processing mode or another group is selected without the play@@ list .
owing to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some features can only be swit@@ ched by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation at Star@@ ten and Be@@ enden can be disabled by credit / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ mate c and Change by &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can simply be inserted .
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / usr / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at the Star@@ ten doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would distur@@ bing the application the application for a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation will be the display of a favourite photos : &amp; lt ; adds ; adds ; adds ; adds ; adds ; adds ; / / / home / K@@ oos ; / body@@ gt ; In the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are in directory tests / some examples of sm@@ il which are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider for the configuration of M@@ player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here the path from the M@@ Player and the cli@@ ent@@ s@@ ary size of the medium can be adjusted from the network and other things .
another tool for de@@ bu@@ g@@ ging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player conf@@ using .
there is no rider for this play@@ ability in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be con@@ figured through a manual approach of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ mate . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa .
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within a k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted the special box em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
thus the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can play , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; Module as a service provider for the MI@@ ME type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setting of dialog commands given by KDE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is in a con@@ sol@@ ete application to search and search for error messages regarding the charging the browser module library . if there is no error occurs , the back@@ end issue is inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to consider ) .
so that always a blu@@ ep@@ rint for a particular MI@@ ME type is taken ( of course only if this was also identified ) , this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c . for example , ph@@ one@@ on all og@@ g files can be returned :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards , either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV , you need to be con@@ figured in easy @-@ to @-@ use device and the TV channels can be manually copied from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be manually copied .
for the con@@ fig@@ ment of the V@@ DR ( video Data Rec@@ order ) Sett@@ ings in the k@@ m@@ player is the dialog to use in the settings - &gt; Qu@@ elle@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports to be detected by which one is selected ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB in it .
since the V@@ DR can use only X@@ video support ( pres@@ um@@ ably this type of play@@ back of video devices under Linux is the only one working ) . this is also the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server functioning properly . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 servers must be following the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time of origin of this documentation , this is n@@ vd@@ n@@ source , int@@ arti@@ ource , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ Scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , vc@@ d.@@ php and v@@ dr@@ iss . when they get activated , they begin with the play@@ list of play@@ list .
is there any cl@@ ue as to do my CD@@ ROM drive , if I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is used as user root after connecting the device . it is absolutely secure to put that / dev / c@@ drom to the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slow , why does each time my CPU must be tested on their performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

the quick @-@ level assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is an effective feature for the quick creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the assistant ( MEN@@ TS ) offers some possibilities for creating the document . it can also be done some of the document related settings .

new users will now have to worry about . it is simply a brief description of the functions and further information in this section are given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile , offering - just as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( and the in@@ appropriate ) . through &amp; k@@ ile ; you should have noticed that any mathem@@ atical environment is not closed . however , it is often notic@@ e@@ ably saves it through the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you through the high@@ lighting time and moves forward .
with the automatic verification of the environments , by entering a new instruction ( eg . \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically a blank file ( entering the text ) and the associated line ( e.g. \ \ \ \ instruction } ) . this function can be disabled in the MEN@@ U settings ; returns ... La@@ Te@@ X commands will be disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; required the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most common and sub@@ st@@ ating element ) :
in the view of the document in the structural no@@ ises , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single mouse click on the individual .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful though . as soon as a DVI ; fil@@ ename file ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent File ) &#93; was created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by a click with the middle mouse button on the DVI ; -@@ viewer on the appropriate line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code .
a DVI ; file contained a description of the form@@ att@@ ed document and also other information like the font and is adjacent to PDF automat@@ on output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for view , conversion and printing of DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and t@@ int@@ ments .
when using the return , the elements of the DVI ; file with the editor allows , and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file search is sung , becomes the exact opposite of it . once upon a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; code s@@ text was sho@@ cked , it is sung to the corresponding location in DVI ; -@@ viewer .
Master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other incorporated .@@ tex files is simpli@@ fied . in the use of a project a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
fast construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; code @-@ code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
fil@@ tration : in this mode , the DVI ; -@@ File at Ã ¼ n@@ der@@ ver@@ - provides res@@ it@@ jacket and is not a call by &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick@@ ening .
in consideration of the tool@@ bar the tool@@ bar should be implemented for the quick introduction of common items into the document . the first selection field is designed to quickly inser@@ tion of the document in parts , chapter , sections , ... The rec@@ kl@@ ed &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for sub@@ division are :
the ins@@ cription Add@@ itional is for example from articles such as tags , filling notes , or references . the speci@@ fies possibilities are :
name : with this command a name for a paragraph , an image or other element is created .
reference : will be used for a reference to a fixed name ( selection or selection of a selection . )
when dealing from quote is displayed a selection list with liter@@ ary entries . the author doesn &apos;t work if the file is required to a project . for the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author can have good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile .
the last selection field with the name F@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¼ r e is used for determining the scrip@@ tures . it can be defined as the main text , the fu@@ ther notes etc . there are the following characters :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; there are two selection of options : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document and the restric@@ ting of the settings . 2 . the document may be written by reason to hand .
the stap@@ les after the command \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font . if the scrip@@ tures has not fixed at the beginning , this can also be ign@@ ed in the text .
once the ob@@ session code has been entered it is to compile &amp; lat@@ ex ; code @-@ text will be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the MEN@@ A building or the button @-@ growing fast construction .
the code @-@ text must be stored in front of the compile . &amp; k@@ ile ; add the storage automatically .
slim the comp@@ iling of the document errors , should be sought in the proceeding according to errors . when using fre@@ t@@ ance , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , it should also be considered the log@@ ging .
a environment ( en@@ f. environment ) is a text that is different from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the writer , is intended to have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ giving { environment } em@@ ail@@ eth the Ã ¼ r@@ acy of the font .
the distribution is only within the area ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } . there are no signs ( Number ) for the aid in an environment .
there are lots of possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and ease of use of the document . it can include certain fon@@ ts , fat printing , cur@@ si@@ v@@ pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . add or end either with the command \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the c@@ im@@ print and is long as long as he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a set can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ rate : creates a quote in the document . quote starts with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
once the background is presented to writing the source with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; recording facility , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile .
once in the assistant a bit of text was typ@@ ed , some adjustments to be performed for the better read@@ ability of the document . therefore , there should be a quot@@ ation , a few positions in the fat and cur@@ si@@ v@@ print and a poem to see the differences of these commands .
once the document was viewed , via editor &apos;s View or C@@ tr@@ l is returned to the editor ( for internal be@@ holder ) . at an external viewer , its windows must be shut down .
once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed or translated into a Post@@ Script file ; simply try and have fun .
HDMI ; is a ger@@ ent file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; oder &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi edition as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ converting or compu@@ ter@@ scre@@ ens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file is the same steps as for the preparation of document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can be printed ( in the viewer ) printed ( if the printer is set properly ) .
the tool@@ bar wor@@ shipped the transformation of the DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; -@@ file dating from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; code s@@ text was created , the conversion can begin in selected other formats by means of the tool@@ bar .
the pre@@ diction search for the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding adjustment for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ connection files . this includes only Modern in attitudes to@@ ile ... tools be@@ auen balanced .
to hon@@ ouring the anticip@@ ation , the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor is positioned in a line of the source code and as@@ le@@ ep on pre@@ diction search . the jump to the appropriate place on the screen ; -@@ viewer are made then .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button on the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; k@@ ile ; used and used to appropriate line . this must be defined as a text editor ( Sett@@ epi@@ ece des ... Editor )
should case in case of quick@@ ening of the &amp; DVI ; -@@ viewers not fit , there may be a mistake . should an error occurs , this is shown in the log file or in the message window in the window .
the log@@ ging file character@@ izes the error source in the source code . in the editor you can see the correct of the previous La@@ Te@@ X f@@ laws and error occurred between the errors . the lo@@ gs file is always possible to click on the faul@@ ty line . to click on the faul@@ ty line and &amp; k@@ ile , jumps to the faul@@ ty line .
once upon the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose the templates for use for document . the pres@@ ences are :
selecting a blank document , a document can be used either from scratch or the assistant to quickly create a new document . more information on this can be included in the section .
ugly users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; normally use the same introduction for almost all documents . Templ@@ ates in &amp; k@@ ile ; compiled , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either needs an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file , or a new file will be created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and selection from document template ...
when creating a new document of a template using file , some char@@ s are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set in attitudes to@@ ile ... settings different .
when creating your own template it is necessary to know which char@@ ds are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OPTI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically , it will be used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OPTI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wi@@ z@@ ard and the fil@@ tration of the commands in the Editor . once the document has been created , the following steps has been taken :
when creating a new document then its own template instead of the standard holds .
a template can be made of any &amp; lat@@ ex ; file files are created . if a simple way to create a template is required , it should be sought by the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; uses &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is an editor for a programmer with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting from many different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings can be performed directly from the menu .
to experience more Ã ¼ e &amp; Kate ; and its possibilities should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start there with the reading of the chapter with the editor of &amp; Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command@@ ing reference , which can be called the MEN@@ U @-@ help La@@ Te@@ X @-@ reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use , as well as their syn@@ tax .
a double @-@ click with pushed str@@ g key to w@@ ander the &amp; tex ; word . this means that in this way , clicking on \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
at the drag of the text with penet@@ rated left mouse button , the text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow buttons with engra@@ ved output taste , can be classified parts of the source in the editors window .
&amp; k@@ ile . has the possibilities to search for different types of source codes and emphas@@ ise them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands differ from the normal text and also the mathem@@ atical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color .
lots of wi@@ z@@ ards can choose wet in@@ lets . thereby it is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . it is also a key@@ note cover or the corresponding key@@ note address , so this Spr@@ ung@@ mar@@ s was highlighted , so that in the first input of a drawing is automatically highlighted .
working is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; k@@ ile . although &amp; Kate ; for example , great features have been added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; fil@@ tered there are always many environments and groups and therefore under@@ mines , special commands for their selection . under Be@@ verages , the following commands are included for the text of the text :
w@@ Ã ¤ h@@ lt a complete paragraph ( group of lines included on both sides a blank lines ) . this extended meaning is not included with it tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source ; is thus that the de@@ duc@@ ted cause is separated by two blank lines .
w@@ Ã ¤ h@@ lt the word under the current Cur@@ d position . this choice also has an extended meaning because this command also has a lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a return @-@ line ( \ \ ) and a bad star ( * ) at the end .
for the length of a part of the document it can be seen and by wi@@ res the button Ent@@ f . &amp; Kate ; it offers the key@@ ring C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line will be removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; with own commands , offers a faster panel . among fertili@@ zation , the following commands are included for the length of the text :
re@@ moves a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description to mach@@ ining documents .
it has already been clar@@ ified that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for some other commands under Be@@ works surroundings for a powerful , simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command the start of the current environment is sung ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to the nearby construction site .
with this command the end of the current environment is sung ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to the m@@ ould making in the area .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { surroundings } , is sung to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ru@@ bb@@ ying environment commands may be quickly the Ã ¼ ber@@ blick you can get lost . this command res@@ umes the last used environment , so that the ax@@ le environment structure will not be crus@@ hed .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special orders for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups that are determined by br@@ aces { ... } . among Be@@ works Te@@ X group are a few important commands , those who comply with Be@@ aming environment .
with this command the start of the current group is sung ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ved cl@@ amps .
with this command the end of the current group is sung ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ved cl@@ amps .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the cur@@ ly br@@ ate of a &amp; tex ; group # is located to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of inter@@ locking groups , br@@ ack@@ ets can quickly get lost . this command as@@ hing the last used group , so that the fet@@ ched structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups are not crus@@ hed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple beginnings used as a bed ; for example , the sign of character is used in &amp; k@@ ile , the sign &quot; for two simple character . also , for example , the character is &quot; used . &amp; k@@ ile ; also knows this case and add two as@@ sign of character as a lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic addition of double points of the double character can be set up under Sett@@ ings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X and will be re@@ ared .
there are some other languages used ( eg . n@@ german or French ) and thus German or fran@@ z@@ Ã ¶ s@@ ische form@@ ations . there are also many other languages to be applied .
in the drums of Shift ; integration constra@@ ints &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ef@@ an . if the current position is located within a lists -@@ environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for example a Z@@ eil@@ en@@ um@@ bruch , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
inside a tables area close pro@@ vision@@ ed &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a close break @-@ out separation .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to pres@@ et pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments to be supported . these can be added under Sett@@ ings .
some users want to classi@@ fy the columns in tables and thereby all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; tries to cope with each other . when this tab@@ ulator is required , not the troub@@ les@@ s , for the columns to the current tab@@ ulator .
although &amp; Kate ; already a good source code design@@ ation offers , it was incorporated in &amp; k@@ ile ; about special commands ( usually fÃ ¼ r &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . they work three according to demand and the other two are suitable for automatic verification . all of these modes can be adjusted for different work@@ places under Sett@@ ings ... complete .
in the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ begin { surroundings } is &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { Sur@@ round@@ ing } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
while the return of the R@@ aim@@ ent taste will be removed the last letter of the input and want to collect the complete list . on the other hand , the list may be smaller by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed from a command , so that a simple jump to these positions by means of emplo@@ ying Spr@@ ung@@ brand N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ste Spr@@ ung@@ mar@@ ke possible and can be classified relative .
under Sett@@ ings k@@ ile ; setup any settings to these lists are to be made . there can be different war@@ di@@ ary lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as instructions of the general language use .
the command line mode is for the comprehensi@@ bility of environments not bad . it will always have a few letters with \ \ begin and the call for the comprehensi@@ bility . on the other hand , the environments often used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the processing of environments for permits .
when calling the full @-@ hau@@ ling mode , the cable @-@ bearing mo@@ wer @-@ mode is automatically laun@@ ches the command and it appears \ \ begin . after that , the environment can be carried out in the easiest way and by pressing the input button .
once this is accomplished , the surroundings are automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile , re@@ alis@@ es that it is a list of lists , is even a first \ \ item -@@ command with one .
under Sett@@ ings k@@ ile ; setup any settings to these lists can be done . this mode uses the W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ list of the Th@@ ei@@ dig@@ al mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; k@@ ile , under@@ lined the user @-@ defined lists of cuts , which can be installed immediately through the liter@@ ary character string . the lists can be set up under Sett@@ ings K@@ ile . as an example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l , in which example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L will be typ@@ ed , for example , the letter has entered , and the word Dis@@ abled Str@@ g + Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste , the code will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
Gro@@ Ã ¤ s e W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ cher are not helpful for automatic verification in a document more than once . thus , it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the comprehensi@@ ble for everyone already written .
this mode can be adapted in the MEN@@ U @-@ settings c@@ ile ... K@@ ile ampli@@ fier . here , the sw@@ elling will be specified for the display of the comprehensi@@ ble .
the full @-@ dig@@ it files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / of the pers@@ Ã ¶ n@@ ant Home folder . mode is related to brevi@@ ation ( Ab@@ dom@@ Ã ¤ r@@ ter ) , dictionary ( w@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ book ) or tex .
the dialog graphics are designed to create graphics as easy as possible . to mit@@ ig@@ ate the fundament@@ als of basic video formats , the sections should be cli@@ cked and notice .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for fix@@ ing and re@@ arrangement of pages . will be used to edit the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools newly arranged and then swit@@ ched with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
to take the result of work to be missed , the source code has to be compiled into the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed into the MEN@@ A creating comp@@ iling , building and construct .
for the comp@@ iling of the source code for viewers , like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used for the keyboard . after that , the DVI ; -@@ file is viewed by means of Alt ; 4 , by means of Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file and be viewed by means ; 5 the PS file is seen .
when using the instruction super@@ structure is normally called a spect@@ ator after the comp@@ iling . should not be inserted into the viewer , then every new window will each be installed .

this dialog allows to manage all of the plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins can be used without a location , and quant@@ it@@ lus ; this path to the Search of the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several individuals in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relations to each other . &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; supports the indication of team members , and these can be con@@ figured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explaining . nickname is the gi@@ ft@@ ist name and is used for clear identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leader , as well as sub@@ project leaders .
the user may look out on the list of members of the team who he is . this happens , by looking out the team member from the list and the button ad@@ resses as oppressed . the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears wise after you are : text .
the nickname and setting of your own identity are important with regard to news and comments . see for further information regarding notes .
in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by collecting the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leader when something happens . see in for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific in the project will be done . an example would be able to see how much anyone working on it , or sending a message when a file is secured , or a script that sends a file into CV@@ S once it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an E@@ Mail will be sent to the address selected at the recipient of the list of address data . the add@@ ress@@ at can be a team@@ - or sub@@ project director . see in , if such leaders are set up .
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments using the following things :
note : it can be either elected either the note @-@ entry from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key word in a commentary area followed by a marked text .
note can be a determining member of the team . in this case , the s@@ syn@@ tax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation is to play a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader sub@@ project manager to the area and sub@@ project leaders should be specified in the corresponding area or sub@@ project name , as in the following examples .
nickname and roll @-@ names are independent of big or small @-@ plates , but blan@@ ks around the br@@ ack@@ ets and the : make the note un@@ ro@@ ar .
&amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; is a development environment for Scrip@@ ting and form@@ att@@ ende@@ es , the D@@ TD diagnostic testing is and web@@ based form@@ att@@ ening and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings are accessible through the settings menu . here only about &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be arranged through settings Qu@@ anta . diesel means a few pages that can be treated in succ@@ ession .
the behaviour of &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; relating to tags including car eff@@ lu@@ ous can thus be changed . the entries are :
big / small @-@ write of tags : large / d@@ elling of automatically inserted tags . normal Groß / small @-@ write means , the tags will be as inserted as they are described in the days of the previous XML files .
large / small @-@ write of attributes : big / small @-@ writing of automatic attri@@ bute . normal Groß / small @-@ write means , the attributes are inserted as inserted as they are described in the days of the previous XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if cor@@ p@@ act , will be optional for tags for which the final day is optional , this instantly after that .
don &apos;t automatically include optional tags : as above for all other tags except for easy tags .
start - and end @-@ day automatically update : if swit@@ ched , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic re@@ placing acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated signs into the appropriate co@@ ding during the fil@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using the default button the standard enco@@ res can be restored .
standard strings : the enco@@ ding of newly created or in other ways other than with file opening files ( where the co@@ ding of the file can be over@@ b@@ yp@@ ass@@ ed ) . but this setting is translated from the same in the project Properties if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not detected , but this setting is done from the same in the project Properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy of a backup copy : &amp; quantitative backup copies , so that in a power cut or crash at the next start of the program the document from this backup can be restored . this is not the same as the saving of the file . also , for yet not stored documents , a backup is produced regularly , according to the provided time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editors ( or the documentation in a box ) , which makes it possible to see the documentation , the preview and the source code at the same time .
replace the window settings on the default to the next start is useful when the interface with modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / depend on views through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command @-@ option parameters .
the War@@ n@@ mel@@ ting -@@ section serves the control of the opportunity to run the display of war@@ nings by An@@ h@@ aken by no more inquiries .
the place for the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change . it can be defined as the display of symbols instead of scripts , like the synchron@@ ization of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view of the specified mode . with regard to the different modes .
here the Par@@ ser and Stru@@ c@@ tural baum , which represents the figure of the Par@@ ser @-@ Ver@@ des in the document , in detail is set out .
in the area of mouse @-@ click on the structural @-@ tree , the following action causes the following action to change by clicking the structural tree with the mouse necessary action .
in the structural setting settings , the inspection of k@@ not can be opened in the tree , the actu@@ alization tool of the tree while maintaining and how deep within a change of structural tree should be opened automatically . both empty spaces are the empty areas in the text , while blank groups are found where the current document is not found .
the area to establish ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( one type of templates ) that can be un@@ folded to multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . this means , it may be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ cl@@ ause ac@@ ron@@ ym a different means than in a group valid for Javascript .
here , the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are K@@ part @-@ applications from third parties , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ part @-@ capable application , at the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins must be set in the following :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information will be supplied to the plug @-@ in , so it can open the current file , the folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component im &quot; read @-@ read &quot; mode : check if the plugin denied the shop . only read @-@ you usually refuse the store when this option is not chosen .
check the plug @-@ in : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; whether the correct information is correct . pick the stor@@ ing of the entry also if the plugin is not available in the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; ab Version 3.3 , the troub@@ les@@ ho@@ oting was completely new . the support for the non @-@ necessary built @-@ built &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been adjusted , as well as the support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of this became a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin concept that allows various implement@@ ations about plug @-@ ins .
currently only a plugin available , support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ lus ; insert .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plug @-@ ins in the project settings . with the button options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin out@@ lay field , the specific settings may be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quantum field ; user interface :
a view in which the content of over@@ watch@@ ful variables is displayed . usually appears in the left column .
a view in which all holding points , with cement and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or it shares the plug @-@ in with , on de@@ pressing challenges . this action is opened by default if a project is opened , that is a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in the normal case does not have to be respected .
the object to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the l@@ ur@@ ges according to requirements .
sends a HTTP server request to the server for a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to see the current document . the output of this requirement is shown in the view Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to begin with the execution of the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the current line @-@ up . if this happens when the script is hal@@ ted , the execution will continue , before a debit card started , the script starts with the request .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to begin with the execution of the script , without inform@@ ing information on monitored variables and the current Z@@ eil@@ serial number , the execution moves on . if this happens before a de@@ bug requirement has been given , the execution starts when a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger guides the next directive in the script without responding to the functions or includes each other .
the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next instruction in the script , whereby if possible in functions and includes error @-@ based .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the statement and go to the next one , as if the current is not .
opens a dialog , in which a variable or an expression can be entered . the super@@ vised value appears in the variation .
with this dialog a variable is given or a new value of a variable .

this chapter outlines how you can adapt and quant@@ it@@ lus ; to suit your needs and how to help you and quant@@ it@@ lus ; help you better .
Docum@@ entation Ed@@ iti@@ er@@ pak@@ ete ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; profession@@ ally , to provide support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting rooms as well . thus , they allow &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; skills such as car @-@ completion and storage rooms . your simplicity and flexibility is made of &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for Web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up @-@ languages and Family 2 , the script folder and the tool@@ bar . day @-@ folder includes two data types , the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bar , text and instructions faster in a document than a user ever could .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically generated from an existing D@@ TD . see for details on the conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files then the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bar . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes of tags and the layout and content of the self @-@ catalog , the &amp; quantitative data ; for the day reveals . the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; themselves . tool@@ bar allow a fast inser@@ tion of tags into a document without danger of writing fault .
tag files are nothing but a folder . they only contain the des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day @-@ folder carry the name of the writing language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 . )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declar@@ es whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible to allow other users a better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and borders is laid in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but it does not contain merely an element type about themselves .
the type of tags is a script function . in use is called &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument to function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type of conference class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type is valid . gives the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attri@@ but@@ ary group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ tag . this is a only element type item .
describes a attri@@ bute of a tags . this element can only occur once for any attri@@ bute . additionally , it lays the name and the type of the attri@@ bute . additionally , there are other tags which will describe how this attri@@ bute should be displayed , etc ; This is a only element type element .
returns to the exhau@@ st used source codes for the attributes in day @-@ Ed@@ it@@ or@@ dialog and in the attri@@ bute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within and quant@@ it@@ lus ; is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p @-@ Metho@@ den@@ name within himself is used in the reach of the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a pattern and a methodology . the arguments that are transferred to the method can be empty or a @-@ day name , which means the name of the current tags .
a container day which group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it may happen for a attri@@ but@@ able description only once . it is a single element type .
defines the position of the attri@@ but@@ ing of a tags within a dialogue . this day can happen for any attri@@ bute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each one ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements that may happen within the specified tags . this element is a just @-@ element type .
returns a list of elements that end a day . this item is a just @-@ element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; -@@ De@@ declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and have to be neat and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but watch on &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ore this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; be replaced . this will cause no leg @-@ break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools Dialog you start in the field &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ window to start and test Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose another dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . at present , the review is only when charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus .
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML @-@ file . this file describes it &amp; lt ; Schema &gt; -@@ element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ Schema . the fil@@ ename for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file one &amp; PHP ; hand@@ load function is described . the fil@@ ename of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; File &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class _ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also fairly simple and there is an editor activated via D@@ TD Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ TD settings . this can be done for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = use@@ de 1 for &amp; quantitative data ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ TD / / EN ) nickname = The simpli@@ fied name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.01 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nickname .
an action can define with settings actions ... click on new action leads to the same dialogue :
the weight of this action is weigh@@ ted . with click the button interface , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ ein the current but@@ ary is far away .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be typ@@ ed a text in the detailed settings and in carrying out the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current by@@ te position . see the example below .
this is the powerful action type . by means of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , however it is not limited ) that can change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; themselves are the Quick start -@@ Dialog or the different See ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be stated . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended that % scrip@@ t@@ thee Vari@@ able in the command line : global scrip@@ ting folders : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quantitative / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the Command Line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the docum@@ ent@@ ations .
% pid : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quantitative course ; if taken by &amp; quantitative . if only one instance runs , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used for controlling and quant@@ it@@ lus , from the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ ename of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the listed methods , a script input of &amp; quantitative data can lead to the default configuration . in the selection process can be determined what to send to the default options . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only with this setting useful .
according to the input , the output of the issued application can be diver@@ ted . there are two types of output : normal output , posted to the standard error hand@@ over . it can be indicated , which is to happen with which to set the default text , by adding the value of the release output :
if there are many tags in Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to set the tags in logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create their own tool@@ bar . in given cases , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select settings to set them .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button , at the bottom of the window will start the mach@@ ining mode .
fill out all the required fields and add them to the tool@@ bar .
complete everything and , in case of the day attributes , and you can plan their use , activate dialog &quot; Day , &quot; if available , so that a input when using the action is possible .
ignor@@ ance ! is it an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? we replace it before we have trouble .
to create a symbol that action is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ ilo@@ edit ; select from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphic Fur@@ ther programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ vor@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , you choose size from others .
please note that the created symbol cannot only help you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
with regard to that the day start , means , I decided to create a button kno@@ b as a symbol . through the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as loose , rigi@@ d , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user would sign@@ aled that the click of this symbol is one &amp; lt ; start@@ up ; -@@ tag will fit in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it must still be linked to action . this happens via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; ) and selection of desired action . besides the text field there is one button , press him .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is , select it and confirm with OK .
push the action button and continue with other tags , so there are , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to complement several Common &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; -@@ functions to the tool@@ bar , or set it in a better overview of some separ@@ ator into several groups . Set the tool@@ bar set out dialog across settings tool@@ bar . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( from left top ) for my tool@@ bar . according to the selection of the element it is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow @-@ taste to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add the tool@@ bar to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . anyone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start @-@ button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested through donations of all symbols , to ensure that everything works .
secure to the right folder . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , there will be im@@ tri@@ bal pattern but your work@@ stations ( n ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust their tool@@ bar ( n ) , if a file is opened from the corresponding type .
maybe the most not@@ e@@ worthy enhancement of &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; add to the ordinary users the possibility to documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ att@@ ing language you like most . therefore , this chapter , as I create a &amp; PHP ; -@@ Docum@@ entation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could consider in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory , whether someone has done so for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc . language search . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we will leave you , the second one we handle here .
# KDE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the Docum@@ entation files e.g. php@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top item = Your description for these docum@@ ent@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 _ html _ html _ 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html _ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html _ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html _ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _
the section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentary tree . for instance , you see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation is such a thing :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level Import@@ ant = introduction , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .ht@@ ml _ import , ... introduction = intro@@ duc@@ tion@@ .ht@@ ml ... Language Reference = Basic syn@@ tax , ... Basic Reference = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax .ht@@ ml ...
note the # before the non @-@ started and Language Reference . this indicates that the sub@@ folder in the tree is concerned with its own content . there is no known limit for the p@@ itu@@ dinal version ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the index is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistently at the top of the tree sight &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; Res@@ ourc@@ end@@ at@@ eien .
the table @-@ section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is intended to display the context of context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script required the documentation to be displayed directly . by flag@@ ging the function named and pres@@ sures of C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context @-@ help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the cont@@ ext@@ list ( Cont@@ acts List ) and the file @-@ binding .
a simple list of sc@@ atter@@ ing context @-@ elements that are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can simply save your file do@@ cr@@ c and save it to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / quant@@ a / doc / apps / quant@@ a / doc / apps / quant@@ a / doc for local or global use . then , create a folder ( so , as you have indicated this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and it &apos;s worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. the documentation have been used to the &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for use by the &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; -@@ Community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked on the best web @-@ platform platform .
with &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; are you not alone . it is possible to divide the de@@ classified resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , work@@ stations with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else to whom . at different places there is an email to send , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD &apos;s package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with e @-@ mail , tool@@ bar @-@ tool@@ bar with e @-@ mail , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts tree .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main Archive , from where all the other &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; -@@ users can download it . the contributions are reviewed and only available when our team needs them as correct and user @-@ fully for publication . in order to ensure a beneficial contribution , the origin of the resources is assured , both for our team and later users .
when loaded , you are asked for your passport for their private G@@ PG @-@ key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can re@@ distribute a single resource . in the dialog New resource must be loaded ( URL preview is empty ) and by clicking on OK the upload will be started .
the upload can upload from the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) to upload the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the Templ@@ ates and scripts Tree ™ .
after downloading of a resource , still prior to installation , exam@@ ines &amp; quantitative . in case of problems war@@ ns it and it can then be canc@@ eled . please note the warning messages carefully . if integrity is given and the resource correctly is signed , a message appears with the indication of the author of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages that is currently not yet supported by &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files in the day @-@ XML format could be necessary . it gives the sim@@ pl@@ est way to transform a D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD shop and converting a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which is to be used . afterwards the following dialogue :
target name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written using this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .

tuning of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if activated , brings &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; after the transformation the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in the quant@@ it@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand this and get full benefit from &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; therefore , one needs to bring them exactly these concepts with these fundamental concepts without their understanding &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; little utility .
in &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus , working area divided into three parts : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in and quant@@ it@@ lus .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; uses , available . from work@@ stations about actions , everything is selected as globally , in the common folder structure of &amp; quantitative data . this enables the administr@@ ators to secure different work@@ stations , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available in a multi@@ user environment at the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development strategies for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bar . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be anything of &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ bar especially for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder @-@ tree of the project , which means the common usage of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editors window , the tre@@ views with information and the tool@@ bar , please propose and for further information about these areas .
you can click the box with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document , such as close the current , other or all map , newly re@@ charging , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marking or version of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right click on the editing range , lead to another context menu regarding the written document contents , such as basic processing steps ( output / paste / paste ) , editing of the file under the mouse button , or opening the file , when the string is referred to under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor a file .
at the top of the Ed@@ it@@ or@@ f@@ enst@@ ers are the tool@@ bar of the editors . currently , &amp; HTML ; 4.01 trans@@ itional is shown as default , for which a set of tool@@ bar is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; the tool@@ bar is adapted to the new functions and the associated user needs .
the use of tool@@ bar is really light . if they want to insert them into a single day , then click the icon that represents the day . now , you can enter the data for this just added day . if you want to insert the data for this just one day ( like an@@ chor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the Bau@@ man@@ sights ( Q@@ IT ) allow it to navigate and navigate in the information , to navigate and under@@ strip them . in the presentation with cardboard boxes , document structure , scripts , scripts and documentation construction sites available .
project Management is a powerful tool , the &amp; quantitative tool which provides . this view displays all files in the project and allows the de@@ fer@@ ing of the files in the project by right mouse @-@ click . actions like Ad@@ ding , removal , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be done with the indicated context menu .
another possibility of &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; is the use of templates . nearly everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all options open .
templates can be split into three categories , depending on how they use . global templates are always available , local styles only available for the corresponding users and templates on projects are available only in the project . more on templates is available in .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retri@@ eve the available information on a script . you need additional functions , such as the script should start , edit or send an email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by links @-@ clicking of the element , the cur@@ sor is set in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking of the element there is a list of commands with regards to navigation and refres@@ her the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree @-@ views . with it , some attributes and nam@@ esp@@ es can change . this leads to the content aligned manually , the changes of all available attributes with a few clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . it can be downloaded pre @-@ extrac@@ ted documentation for &amp; quantitative ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder into a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; quantitative , two card @-@ fron@@ ts at the bottom end of the window , can be achieved through the us@@ ain@@ able information : the message window and the problem window .
this map Le@@ ading displays information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . so , for example , the D@@ TD used the current document and all changes to D@@ TD are displayed .
this map Le@@ ading displays every mistake in the market @-@ up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; -@@ Scrip@@ ts , which are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; work@@ stations are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command shown . the chocolate bar the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in and quant@@ it@@ lus .
another function of &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; is the skill to send a tool@@ bar to send an email . &amp; quantitative T@@ ar @-@ Archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can save it in and quant@@ it@@ lus , like any other .
it is reasonable when you want to adjust the location of &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; files to your system . therefore , auto@@ conf have a number of options to pass to the configure script . to give a complete list of all options , please give . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not running here .
if you have problems at the starting of &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus , you should check whether your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 am a folder . also , you should ensure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of your bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; is a web @-@ development tool for KDE surface . &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; was optimized for swift web @-@ development and combines a well @-@ engine@@ ered development environment with a number of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; an editor began to employ the developers of &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus , who would be an independent , extensi@@ ble Mark@@ up @-@ language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer confin@@ ed to pure &amp; HTML , is &amp; quantitative ; now , it is far on its way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . together , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then , &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; therefore , be the appropriate &amp; IDE ;
well , to the above must be held that &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; as a product is based on outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer &apos;s community is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer &apos;s idea is not only possible , but it allows users and developers , and quant@@ it@@ lus ; to bro@@ aden them as they need for their need .
&amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; enables users to boost the utili@@ zation of a intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this may extend the productivity nearly every task . through the program comp@@ elling you can notice them &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; to remember without scrip@@ ting a scrip@@ tural language tax . ( more about them find it in . )
&amp; quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for both HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; quant@@ a ; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of &amp; quantitative . the original developers picked up the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .

a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file , which is not considered the oldest entry .
this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look in the section about templates . should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project pre@@ disposition card , only a mistake is reported .
inser@@ tion when inser@@ ting the cli@@ p@@ board there contained special characters on &amp; HTML ; -@@ Registration , so that they are correct and not mis@@ understood by the browser as form@@ att@@ ing reference .
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ Registration , which is the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and blan@@ ks in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the an@@ chor day .
enables the block@@ ers to or from . this allows you , text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; taste to choose .
getting directly to a row player . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script troub@@ les@@ s does !
seek a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined selection to help you .
displays the message window or not on . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
pull @-@ off the problem re@@ por@@ ters on the lower edge of the &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; Haupt@@ f@@ enst@@ ers . the problem porter will be activated once you change to the structural tree .
shows the tool@@ tip left of the main window . this column allows you , book@@ marks with a single mouse click .
if there are bookmark in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries of previous or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the fil@@ ename of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; -@@ projects are stored in .@@ web@@ pr@@ j file .
presents a dialog to inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
brow@@ sing the project list according to new files which might be there . this allows to copy e.g. graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folders and then add them to the project .
loads the files into your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded further input / output emo@@ des ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
settings , such as quant@@ it@@ lus ; the project managed . in Chapter &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projekte you can find details .
loads a tool@@ bar @-@ tool@@ bar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bar and are only available in this menu if you have applied to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by means of actions ... added . work@@ stations are stored on the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , or you will be asked at the operator , whether you want to save the tool@@ bar .
remove a tool@@ bar from the visual range . it does not delete it from the hard disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ team , so that the tool@@ bar in the next release is available ) . the menu item will open a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an attachment .
allows the upload of tool@@ bar to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in .
charging one &amp; D@@ TD ; that you or any someone else has made and convert into the &amp; quantum field ; own description .
download / retri@@ ev@@ ing of the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it is useful when the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be refres@@ hed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to renew . if this globally , and a des@@ patch in the global KDE folder is not present , the shop fails .
this menu includes a list of tags which are available in the current tool@@ bar , if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is in the tags menu , a sub@@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day of registration dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags always available , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or dis@@ ables the smart past@@ ing of tags . currently this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent past@@ ing means that &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; that inser@@ ting the tool@@ bar , if this day dis@@ agree on the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plugins are listed under the top @-@ mentioned menu cards . click on them . click an active plug @-@ ins disabled .
select the syn@@ tax mechanism for the current file . the list of available her@@ al@@ chem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ Version .
choosing the type of line identification . very useful when you know people who use other OS @-@ platforms to use . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh .
review the syn@@ tax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; by using the external application .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in KDE libraries can cause the switching time sometimes time or unpleasant graphics . recommended is the box card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus , 3.2 and earlier .
additionally , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . with a selection of one entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
un@@ folded the status of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; Haupt@@ f@@ enst@@ ers .
the changes in this dialog loads any application which use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser .
judge the behaviour of the editors . see the documentation of &amp; Kate ; see details .
a dialogue will appear in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar , or which can change the sequ@@ ences .
this should create an help in accordance with the environment of the mouse user , but it is not implemented yet .
&amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always help the developer . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; development in financial form .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled best from top to bottom , as for example , after completing the project called the whole directory @-@ structure for the rest of the project automatically . all of these paths and author information fields can be later adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project project properties .
here is the name for the project to include , for example foo . when entering your name file will automatically be filled out .
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; project @-@ file . by default , it has the name of the project in small lo@@ wer@@ case and without spaces with extension of web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine , to which one wants to access , one , except you edited local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ scal@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
lets the field empty , the default settings of the chosen proto@@ cols may be used , depending on the setting of the remote host , it could be an adjustment necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored . it is a rel@@ ational path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bar to be stored for the project . it is a rel@@ ational path to the project and by default tool@@ bar . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should instead be set instead of standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . you can select multiple files or whole folders .
this setting is great if you have static content , you want to download and change . at ser@@ ver@@ side script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently .
p@@ act if files , which are to be involved anywhere in the main folder of the project , if a project is started on a new one , not to tap into account .
with this option all files and folder will be displayed within the root folder and you can make a suitable selection to vou@@ ac .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files through An@@ h@@ acks or , by removing the tick , cl@@ amps from the project .
the final screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that will simplify your work . these settings can upload or change in the menu with project characteristics in the menu sheet in the window @-@ window or with the key@@ note Shift ; F@@ 7 will be changed .
some settings apply to those in the project assistant and are described in . additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( wild@@ card possible ) , which can be ignored in project @-@ related operations such as the project @-@ related operations .
supple@@ mental option on top , also files stored in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ors are excluded from the project .
the project view that is being loaded with the opening of the project . in any case , more about proj@@ ections can be consul@@ ted .
this can be selected to the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently there is only Gub@@ ed support . more information about Gub@@ ed is available in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plugin can be set with the button options . in the de@@ bug tool can be described .
in the sub@@ window , high @-@ load profiles can be up@@ loading ( see in ) as well as the display of a template for the content of the server for each profile , adding its own supervision for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . look into the details .
in the sub@@ window configuration , you can switch event action and add these actions to change or delete . event list will occur if a previously definite event occurs , such as the sick@@ le of a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; the last project , that was opened . we cannot influence this behavior .
to open a different project , select project ... from the menu project , or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; closed , the project @-@ file is automatically saved . you will be asked whether you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
project management gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folder behavior likewise , however , the entries are opening and opening with ... in the right mouse @-@ click context menu :
here you can find different profiles . the profile contains information on the site of the highly appro@@ ve files .
enabling the del@@ e@@ tion of the current profile . if only any more of a profile is present , the button is lo@@ resc@@ ind@@ ed to prevent the removing .
the password is kept in the core memory and forgot if the most frequent upload of files is needed and the rather uns@@ afe password on the record @-@ option does not come into question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog , if you want to change your opinion in front of the high @-@ load .
in and quant@@ it@@ lus , many high @-@ loading profiles can be up@@ loaded , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to different servers . when working , or create a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server that should be copied to the files . either a fully qualified dom@@ ain@@ name or IP address function .
the transfer protocol for the upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . normally this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator leaves a service not at the usual port .
depending on your att@@ ackers , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the record so it can not be read , but each with programming , it can easily be seen in the plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bar . it can give in a project many views , i.e. , by simple ex@@ changing the view , diverse files and tool@@ bar can be loaded and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bar .
views can be stored in the menu project or project tool@@ bar , available via settings @-@ tool@@ bar @-@ tool@@ bar , opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of H@@ quantitative lus , with which one has to do most . this does not only improve productivity , but also allows adaptation of &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; to its own working method .
as mentioned above are the tool@@ bar in &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; best to distinguish the tool@@ bar exec@@ uting . use and add . adding the tool@@ bar to be displayed below in the section called Add@@ itions of tool@@ bar .
the tool@@ bar and the icons are to be set either by using the context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , and can be implemented by other actions like tool@@ bar , tool@@ bar , or tool@@ bar , which can be specified in the dialog , where actions can be displayed on this or other tool@@ bar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the additional entries will be removed and action is displayed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bar ... and settings to define actions ..
templates are essentially docum@@ ent@@ aries , code cut@@ lets and files on lin@@ ux . &amp; quantitative file system with extended organization and interfaces . one can copy , shift , or each at the system available to link to the pre@@ orders tree . assi@@ sts in &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you imagine for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions attached at the beginning of each template quot@@ ed before use .
Bin@@ är is everything that is not pure lyrics . it can be any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ ary templates are usually inserted in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g src = / src / ur@@ l ) . some information on the templates are available in templates .
documents can be used by any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . normally , a simple frame for the purpose and runs the work in appropriate way to be efficiently . some examples may be found in advance tree under global templates . see for more information on the templates .
this kind of templates is useful when not a new document to be inserted on a template , but the same text area will always be included in documents . some examples may be found in the pre@@ amp tree under global templates . see in for more information on the templates .
as the name says , these templates are used for entire websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents , which can be organized in a comp@@ ressed tar archive . at present there are not examples in a capsule form .
design a document structure by Bel@@ i@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select File Now as a template it save as a local template !
once this is done , notice that ( even if it is stored as a project location ) the template is not visible in the project @-@ tree . look in the pre@@ amp tree under project specifications .
select text in your document and save to file as a template store selection as a local / project location . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn to pul@@ ling and insert on the site template .
the production of bin@@ ary templates is simple : the file is only to copy into a template folder . it can be used all file management functions , such as pul@@ ling and inser@@ ting or inser@@ ting the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select either in the file tree or in the project files . select a name for the template and backup site template . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template .
project proposals enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pre @-@ create head@@ lines and foot@@ print or dynamic with &amp; PHP ; you can insert files or connect them with them . additionally , you can keep a few things in mind in dealing with initiatives in projects very profound .
the deposits structure in the sub@@ window is based on the stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quantitative / version and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / quantitative / version / version . each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of vessels as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder list , click the folder overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu properties . the following dialogue will be displayed :
a selection with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is canc@@ eled as soon as El@@ ter@@ ous attributes have been hal@@ ted .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the tribe of the deposits . if a trunk @-@ folder would be set up , it would specifically dis@@ able in this path , except they would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like a text element . if nothing appears , one is probably in a trunk @-@ folder .
allows previous or thought@@ ful text for templates in this folder . this could be general Head@@ lines and head@@ lines for all templates for a particular project and allows to equi@@ p a whole presentation already with the matching Head@@ lines / foot@@ print .
in addition , you have the right @-@ click menu ( pointing , right mouse button ) on a complete command from folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; quant@@ it@@ lus , offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; HTML @-@ Editor , which tells about the menu view . the first mode replaces the source code editor through the V@@ PL ; the Editor and the Second Fig@@ ure shares in two parts : the source Editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : he invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor . then you can switch to edit and when needed to source code editor , in which the changes made in V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor in source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document , the &amp; PHP ; includes , it shows a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ ion of &amp; PHP ; code editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; Data Editor , continues to edit the code editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode functions exactly as the first one , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source editor and the cur@@ sor in the source code Editor and in V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor syn@@ ch@@ ron is activated . with pres@@ sures of F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , the key@@ note puts the active cur@@ sor from a window to another , whereby the position in the document is maintained .
the synchron@@ isation stand between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code editor allows to select Sett@@ isation after a click or automatically . in the selection automatically , you can choose between synchron@@ isation after a click or automatically . in principle the recommendation applies : a small span@@ king for quick calcul@@ ators and a big span@@ king for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so Tools Docum@@ entation is possible to choose . with this , the processing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; the editor will also be called when a new document with the V@@ PL ; the editor will be created , and this is the reduction of the suspension of the pend@@ ent Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ens .
met@@ a @-@ tags allows the storage of information on the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . Met@@ a @-@ elements can be added by pieces of the two buttons below or removed . a click in the list enables the modification of the content , such as key words on the column name and key word key on the content column .
CSS @-@ rules are the new way of designing the design of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list or delete a change on the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not currently supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style location by pressing on the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the use of the cur@@ sor is like in a text processing , possible thanks to the arrows , possible . among rare circumstances the cur@@ sor is working as usual . text can be inserted through one @-@ type and be deleted by back@@ taste or removing button .
inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same manner via the tool@@ bar , as in the code editor . it is note that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags will not be removed , e.g. if a an@@ chor day , surrounded by text , each other real@@ ms must be removed .
some tool@@ bar like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . they are later published in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists are to be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for exam@@ ining the style templates . in contrast to other programs for breast@@ feed runs , the search for specific elements is possible and the execution of the style template is followed .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , use except &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available .
stop in a template , in one place in one of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g loaded style or x@@ ml file or at the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in the g@@ db @-@ pati@@ bility mode , you can set the or@@ ative st@@ ints in a certain file and a row number and later be activated .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a fil@@ ename without a path@@ name . fil@@ ename in the same folder as the top up@@ loaded path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is located for example a sty@@ li@@ l file . / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ sl is possible to input the following input possible :
in this instruction is checked to a partial or whole agreement with a lecture called my@@ QNA@@ ME or a specified mod@@ ore name . &amp; eg ; template agre@@ es with each QNA@@ ME , which contains the string template .

there are many graphical tools for compar@@ isons . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the mer@@ ging was very complicated , because one of the respon@@ dents have done many changes and at the same time had corrected the sett@@ ling in many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts in together .
the program used to me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no evidence on the places where perhaps only the her@@ b@@ ulation had changed . that made these changes was a little night@@ mare .
so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white signs . later , more useful features were added .
if you would like to compare text to an example , just copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it into one of the compar@@ ative window .
a function that did a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and assembled from folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way @-@ assembled is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of each other at a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screens@@ hot shows 3 Qu@@ ell files at the same time :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the compar@@ isons and merge complete folder . this screens@@ hot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; at the folder @-@ together :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and reno@@ un@@ ces the possibilities of today &apos;s color monit@@ ore . if you have frequently asked Ko@@ de , you will like this feature .
differences in white signs and tabl@@ ers are displayed visible . if rows are only different in a certain number of white signs , you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left . ( no hass@@ le more , if someone changes the rec@@ ess . )
when a file is equal and the other is different in one line then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files are the same names , but in different folders , you can make your ti@@ p@@ work easier by writing only the fil@@ ename in the first file .
Gr@@ amed 3 folder @-@ 2 folders , k@@ diff@@ 3 folders , k@@ diff@@ 3 folders , k@@ diff@@ 3 folders , k@@ diff@@ 3 folders , 2 folders , 2 folders , 2 folders
the Open dialog permits the manual type of fil@@ ename , the selection of the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last@@ ly @-@ opened file from the list . you do not need to specify the third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences between two files will be performed .
over the kno@@ folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the comparison will be selected , for B and C however a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ ename from A to the two other folders .
if collap@@ sed , the input field is active for purpose and can be dealt with . however , it is not necessarily necessary to specify a output file later . you can handle this step later on the store .
the setup button will open a dialog with settings . here you can specify options before starting with the compar@@ isons .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text components from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active compar@@ ative window . the comparison starts then immediately . in opening dialogue , you do not need to select files , you can simply enter the dialog with the Canc@@ el @-@ button .
you can also drag and drop off , just drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let him fall over a compar@@ ision window .
which idea is behind it ? sometimes contains a file for example , several similar features . if you want to find out how similar to these features , it would be a relatively large effort . you &apos;d only need to create two corresponding files , put them into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; now you can copy the relevant sections simply , paste and then compare .
note : currently you can &apos;t delete anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; just drag the falling out of text into a compar@@ ative window .
warning : some editors interpret the pul@@ ling and break@@ down of text into another program than cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of cop@@ ying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data might be lost .
in the upper part of each text window , the info @-@ line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ ename and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest a while above the line . then a small help window will display the full name . )
the three source code are the letters A , B and C assigned . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be modified via the Sett@@ ings menu . )
when a difference is realised , one sees in the color that file diff@@ ers . if both files differ , the pres@@ et colour is red . ( colour for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( bring together ) well .
left besides the text there is the summar@@ ize column . if differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages the colour is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + ) , white signs are relevant only in string and comm@@ issions , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare single cases . )
the vertical line , divi@@ des the summar@@ ize column of the text is interrupted in the points where the relevant source file has no lines . if the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ um@@ bruch is activated , the line is dot@@ ted at enclosed lines .
the result window ( among the compar@@ isons ) also has a info @-@ line with the ins@@ cription edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ames and &#91; changed &#93; when you have edited the result . usually , it contains already text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ solved , the stor@@ ing is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to the nearest / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons use are used , every difference appears at the same time a conflict that has to be solved manually .
by clicking the left mouse button in one of the windows the first line of the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this will also be a jump of position in the windows , where the top of the group is otherwise not visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for the current range and on the left hand a black beams .
sometimes , by automatic transm@@ uting or by manu@@ als , no more line is left in the group ; then , in these lines the text is displayed ; no line in the quot@@ ed , then you may change your mind and perhaps another source . this text appears either in the final saved file , nor in a mark@@ er that you might just copy and insert them elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; mer@@ ging panel , however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go cau@@ ti@@ ously with this function .
note : when selecting the sources the options ignore or ignor@@ ance C / C + + comments are enabled , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
this navig@@ ates mainly with the image running and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the windows , you can use the arrow buttons , right , top , tr@@ l @-@ beginning and str@@ g end , si@@ p as you can also used by other programs . the excess column next to the vertical machine bar can also be used to the N@@ avi@@ ins .
in the Aug@@ ab@@ ef@@ en@@ ster you can also use the other keys to mach@@ ining . with the inser@@ tion button you can switch between entry and transfer mode . ( pres@@ et is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ izing columns , synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the top of each group ( as already in the section ) and the ed@@ itable output argument was explained ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ bottom / Str@@ g @-@ above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ Picture A@@ way ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Picture A@@ way ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Picture Ab@@ way ) or to the next / previous conflict will continue to solve as conflict . therefore , between detached and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished .
to copy the mark@@ ings into the cli@@ p@@ board , you must press the Cop@@ y button @-@ button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ tion ) . if this option is activated , whatever you mark , automatically puts into the cli@@ p@@ board and be careful with this option but carefully , as you could s@@ lower the content of the cli@@ p@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ enden will be saved according to the underlying operating system . Unix @-@ variants are using a Z@@ eil@@ en@@ vor@@ sch@@ ub \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 keeps the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ vor@@ sch@@ ub \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ user does not keep Z@@ eil@@ en@@ enden of source files not , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ ary files .
the options and the list of last used files will be automatically saved and restored at the next start . ( menu Sett@@ ings@@ - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 Options ... )
choose a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog provides you with vari@@ abl@@ er width to choose from , you should not use it . )
when you activate this option , differences are displayed in Kur@@ si@@ ver writing . if the chosen script does not support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be illustrated . on these systems the button pres@@ ets is automatically an odd color .
when this option is enabled , when pressing the tab@@ ulator key , the appropriate number of spaces are inserted . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator notes is inserted .
if you put entering or return , the entry of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual manually copy the cli@@ p@@ board then .
you can select which Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ende type you can store for stor@@ ing . the pres@@ et value is the generally usual choice on the used operating system .
while the same of files sought &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each row . in this step , white signs will not be ignored . also , while together , white signs will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a W@@ eil@@ en@@ vor@@ s &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others can only look identical . if this option is activated , W@@ agen@@ eder@@ vor@@ s appear , however , like a whit@@ eboard used . during which together , this option must be disabled . in addition , this option is disabled .
in preference , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis are numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) . in the result , the differences are shown nevertheless , but they are treated like white characters .
in preference , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white signs .
intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effectively with complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in the automatic jump @-@ off mode determines this setting how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is continuing .
solve automatic all conflicts in white signs using the chosen file as a source . ( pres@@ et is manual selection . ) That is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you just need this from time to time , then use the automatic selection also conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignor@@ ance C / C + + comments .
these options are treated in the chapter to Scan@@ nen of folders and run by a gathering . look for details under documentation to the directory @-@ compare and cont@@ ours .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version exists the Su@@ ff@@ ix .or@@ ig . if already there is already such a back@@ up@@ file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .or@@ ig , it will be deleted without further backup .
fits the language of the user interface . the change@@ ment of this option does not affect the current program . you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; end and re@@ boot that the change is active . ( this option is set in the KDE Version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is gathered there globally via the control center . )
the following co @-@ settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if you activate this option , the top settings will be applied for all entries .
over the selection of paths for co@@ ding is a brief reference , which is the local co@@ ding . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely informal nature . )
adjust the file code for source files . this influences on how special characters can be treated and interpre@@ ts . as the co@@ ding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and combined with different co@@ ding .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding for the stor@@ ing should be used .
if you define pre @-@ processing wire , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing wire can be used only with 8 @-@ bit AS@@ C@@ II . ) With this option you can set the enco@@ ding of the output from pre @-@ processing poles .
turn this off to press high@@ lighting changes in white signs into the text or review of nails . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignor@@ ance C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files will be displayed . but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files . -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is shown next to the normal nor a second over@@ head column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the space on the screen for long lines . bl@@ ending you simply use the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
inser@@ ting window side by side or over@@ turn . this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes , consider the differences and then decide to bring the files together . a simple click will start together . a simple click will start the fil@@ ename and use the fil@@ ename of the last source file as pres@@ et names for output file . ( if this function is used to perform the merge again , then the name of the last used output file will be kept . )
when reading a file it is transferred first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds exactly to your requirements . you can use this function for example to cut odd parts or to correct the rec@@ itation .
while reading a file it is handed over to this external command . if a normal default command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is only used in line processing . you can write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds exactly your requirements . each input row must have an associated issue line .
the thought behind it , allow the user more flexibility in setting up the slide results . but for this , an external program requires , and most users do not want to program itself . however , the good news is that in most cases be sed or per@@ l completely sufficient .
use this process command for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ ra to convert the input into big letters : sed &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ n / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; The \ \ 1 contained in a row . \ \ 1 contained in a row string refers to the found text in the first stap@@ le string . \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in big letters .
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you like these regular expres@@ sions even . they are very useful because there are many programs which support very similar things .
the ign@@ oring numbers is actually a already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it &apos;s good for example for a further pre @-@ processing wire for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ like most suitable . sed / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 30.00 - &#93; / / g &apos; Je@@ ze sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several repe@@ ats once . then you can separate the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the settings of each other :
instead , sed you can also use something else like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switch &apos; aller@@ dings are in per@@ l some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) required , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after normal pre @-@ processor will be kept for display and consolidation . further operations change only the data that the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ic @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can see .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal Pre@@ processor , the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ ra requires the output of the normal price processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text does not change or differences , you can not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often you need to edit programmers in a folder many files . this is why you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ kur@@ si@@ vely and merge together .
... makes for every object a suggestion to bring together ; you can adjust the suggestion in front of your start ,
... can sim@@ ulate that and displays the sim@@ ulated changes without being really performing ,
... selected selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to compar@@ isons and merge individual files very similar . you only need to open a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are assembled , folder 1 is used as base . if no target folder , used , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folders .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not execute them . to execute the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key ( see further details follow . )
while reading the folder you will notify you a small message window of the current progress . if you break down the folder , only the files are listed until then were compared .
when the scanning is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and each folder that was found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a single mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can double a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or by using the arrow buttons for left / right . the directory listing includes two functions All sub@@ directories and cl@@ apping with which you can catch up all the folders and folders .
if you double click on a file , the file comparison will start and it appears a compar@@ ative window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the type of file is different in the other folder , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the coll@@ ation action may not be selected automatically . if that will perform together , you will be notified about problems of this kind again .
as seen in the above picture , are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black .
in identical entries , the colour is also identical , although the age of the entries is different .
folder will be regarded as identical if their entire content is identical . then , also folder the same color . at folders , the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a paper which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red becomes .
... A and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B ) : error : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such failed items exist , that may not run together .
... A and B does not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B ) : error : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such failed items exist , that may not run together .
the mode to syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ ze is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option cat@@ alogues is active . then chose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action to be identical to both folders . if you have an entry ...
... A and B exist , but are not identical : together , and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as the visible data name for the output file only B ; right after the assembled step &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are assembled and using the option of new file taking place ( uns@@ ure ) , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; files are different , but the exact date is identical , but the exact date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not eliminated , that can not run the folder of the folder .
while together , a file will work after another . she Status @-@ column shows up Fer@@ tig , if it worked together successfully , and according to other reports , when something un@@ fores@@ een occurs , you should make a final review and see if the status is right in order .
when in the setting dialog the file @-@ compar@@ ative method is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 more columns will display . these contain the number un@@ resolved , sol@@ dered , not wh@@ iter and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or combined . )
you can either merge the just selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at a time . if you have selected all of the cl@@ own actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can execute it together .
note : if you have not specified any target folder , then it will be used as a target in the three @-@ folder mode C as the goal , using the two @-@ folder @-@ together B as the goal and will be used for syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ ze A and / or B as a destination .
if you have selected a target folder , please check back to see if all the entries are displayed in the target folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options to be ski@@ pped through the particular entries . check these options to avoid unnecessary surprises :
to perform all the entries : select directory @-@ compiled / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) , select the current element of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if by conf@@ lic@@ ting data types still exist inv@@ ali@@ d actions , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialogue window will be released with the options , sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el .
simply dial if you would like to see what would happen without the really changes done . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is needed ( merge a single file ) then it will open a combined window ( note the screens@@ hot ) .
if you are ready with a file , select again directory / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialogue will appear . then it leads to the next item .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to make a mistake that appears a message and detailed state @-@ information . at the end of the list you &apos;ll see some error messages to help you choose the cause of the problem or to ski@@ p the problematic entry . this way , you have the option to choose another action for the entry or to resolve the problem before you continue with .
if some entries were made individually , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these comments ( in the current session ) and leads them together later , those entries are not stored or stored , these entries are considered settled . only when you change the together action , these entries are once again sum@@ mon@@ ed together .
the Sett@@ ings @-@ menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory cl@@ apping with these options :
only files , which are indicated on the indicated pattern , are displayed in the elementary tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid space @-@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folder must not match this pattern .
files and folder that match this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be added more than one pattern using the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid space @-@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ et is * .or@@ ig . * .@@ o .
files and folder that match this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be added more than one pattern using the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid space @-@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ et is * .or@@ ig . * .@@ o .
ignored files that are also ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ atic generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be adjusted to a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ age file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems files a Ver@@ lies -@@ attri@@ bute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems have a prec@@ eding point . a file is hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the sub@@ tree or not . this option is enabled in the default .
with links to files : when the option is off , symbolic links are compared . when the option is swit@@ ched , the files are compared to which the links will show . this is disabled in the default .
when links to folder : when the option is off , the links are compared . if the option is swit@@ ched , the links will be treated like normal folder and re@@ movable links . a link to a folder of a link to itself would lead to a final gr@@ inding and &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; ) This option is in the default .
introduces a complete analysis of each file and shows the statistics columns . ( the number of solved , un@@ solved , non @-@ wh@@ iter and whit@@ ening conflicts . ) The complete analysis is s@@ lower than a simple binding analysis , and much s@@ lower if they are applied to files which do not contain any text .
if you compare big folder over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change of change and the file size . however , this vel@@ ocity of speed is necessary to use caution . please use this option in preference .
similar to Trust the release date . there is no real comparison instead . the files will be identical as identical if they are identical . that can be useful when cop@@ ying the amendments set . please use caution . this option is un@@ folded in the default .
activ@@ ates the syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ ze mode when two folders are compared and no target folder shown . in this mode , the proposals for together will be selected so that both the files are identical . also , the results of composite files are stored in both folders . this option is in the default .
if there are differences , the cop@@ ying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered un@@ certain because it is provided that the other file is not also changed . you should check this in any case . ) This option is in default .
if a file or a folder is replaced by another or deleted , then the original version is ren@@ amed and receives the extension .@@ original .@@ When an old backup file with the .or@@ c extension already exists , so it will be deleted without further backup . this also concerns normal combined files , not just the composite folder . this option is swit@@ ched in the default file .
usually , the folder @-@ level view remains visible to create individual files ; you can switch the window cl@@ ei@@ ler with the mouse . if you do not want , you can switch the option directory &amp; text window untouched in the window menu and switch between the two views on a change between directory &amp; text window .
probably you prefer to compare a file just by double @-@ clicking on . nevertheless , you can also create a corresponding menu item . you can also run a single file directly without the folder menu . once you save the result , the status will be put forward and the file will not run once again when you start the folder .
this status however is lost if you read the directory again : directory -@@ menu : new read
KDE supports networking with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ diff@@ user uses this for reading files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folder to the opening that are on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to a ftp @-@ server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a comp@@ ressed wine archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syn@@ tax as local files and folders . a few things should you consider :
a path can be relative . or .. included . this is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be mas@@ hed . ( # - &gt; % 23 , vac@@ yl@@ - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file called / # foo # the URL file : / % 23@@ foo % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the used protocol . it follows a brief list of constra@@ ints :
or it may not be distinguished as a link indicates a file or a folder . then , a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ftp : ) .
there is no possibility to edit author@@ ization or modification of modification . therefore , the entit@@ lements or the modification of change from the original . ( do not notice the option familiar to the size . ) ( This is only possible in local files . )
the main reference purpose is currently as differences @-@ viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first always start the built @-@ in differences @-@ viewers . in order to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences @-@ viewer and then select in K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
usually , we need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , when it is considered as a ch@@ part , it takes up a patch file in the Uni@@ fied format . then decre@@ ases &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch running to restore the missing file .
in Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and click from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files since the creation of the patch file have changed .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool@@ bar , and menu . that leads or the equ@@ als of folders is not supported in the K@@ part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ use ( now , it is already . furthermore , the name K@@ CAT@@ 3 already indicates that it can bring together as the program diff@@ use 3 from the Di@@ ff @-@ Tool @-@ Collection .
I am using GPL @-@ programs already very long and have learned a lot by going into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone on or go through it .
you have compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure script not the right pre@@ fix to KDE . in the default configuration parameter in / usr / local , but then KDE can not find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the README file you will find further information on this subject .
if only the number of white signs is different , these lines will appear to be identical as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be considered not identical . if similar lines add next to each other , this is the but this one is the case .
the editor will remember any difference in the files where he begins and where it ends . that &apos;s necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is simply saved as a text file and it is a lot of effort to create an own file format which could save this information .
the effort for this was so far too big . you can recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to convert bigger amounts of text should be used to be another editor .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no src lin@@ nen ; published and the text cannot be clear . what does this mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to differenti@@ ate of difference . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and crow@@ ds come from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; use , need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how you can use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
a list of last changes can be found under ht@@ tp : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
in order to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use following command at the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
KDE gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find more details in the README file .
as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ob@@ ake , you should not have any problems in comp@@ iling . should , however , difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of it .
cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or switching stages ) copies the marked text . inser@@ ting ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or switching ) adds the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current Cur@@ ing position or replaces the current mark@@ ings .
only differences display : files that are identical in all folders are not in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you will need to re@@ fresh changes to those options the folder with the function Re@@ fresh . )
there are only entries shown to display the differences . that also results that identical files are not copied into the target folder . if the target folder these files does not already contain , they are missing according to the target . ( the behavior will be swit@@ ched in a later program version probably . ) This option is in the default version .
note the buttons for selecting the source with the lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you have attached to one of the buttons , the lines will be attached to the bottom of the selected group at the end of the selected group ( if the lines are already present ) , they will be removed in clicking on the button accordingly .
in preference , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager shows a mini@@ ature show of all virtual des@@ k@@ tops . it is fairly handy to see the ongoing programs on the labour market to change their size , to end them or move it . this works both within a working area and several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ k@@ tops as well as the applications in it . applications can be selected and even move on the desktop and the other .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within a shelf ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other working spaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked on : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; cou@@ pl@@ ating the context menu , the context menu and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ise , maxim@@ ize , On work@@ space and finishing . the commands also make the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . appears only if I cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only , when a application was cli@@ cked .
if this approach marks , the window within the bed can be moved , with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working surfaces .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual des@@ k@@ tops are displayed .
cru@@ ising this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ k@@ tops . if its name is indicated , together with name , the names will be provided with Or@@ din@@ al@@ figures , &amp; eg ; 1 .
if this field is cru@@ ci@@ fied , the background of each desktop is also shown as a background in a set @-@ up base .
when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as a small window in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty employment areas will be shown to enable their selection .
here , the view of the program window is selected . simple features simple right @-@ corner with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window will be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , appear like P@@ ager applications in some other Wind@@ ow@@ managers ; wa@@ agre@@ es shows all virtual des@@ k@@ tops in a horizontal and vertical in a vertical series that is very good for the representation of the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to p@@ ager @-@ mini@@ ature program in the control bar . it has the advantage that he will be able to display and post@@ p@@ one the windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it works outside the control bar .
right click on the right button of the mouse within the mouse ; and subsequent selection of switches ... makes the dialog settings appear .
at the moment , this cannot be changed in dialog settings . but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c using any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or , if you do not have a des@@ patch for the file , you need to register as user root or login to your system administrator . in this file you need to as@@ sign the key wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and to give it a value . possible values are :
as &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package is base , you need a functional installation of KDE pack@@ ets .

if you like it ; start , a window appears as above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged part of the screen . in the following , this window will be displayed as magni@@ fier window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a statement window .
in the default setting , grow &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor . alternatively , you can display a selected screens@@ hot of the screen window ( optional display mode ) or the environment of the mouse @-@ screen at the screen ( eg ; at the left side of the screen ) .
do you want to avoid that the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor is shown in the enlarged window , please note that &amp; k@@ mag . this is not yet able to detect the form of the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor . this is always the standard @-@ k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse @-@ cur@@ sor .
in the selection display mode , you can adjust the selection window to your individual needs . you can move it with the arrow and the buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse button in the magni@@ fier window and hold the left mouse @-@ mouse button , so you can shift the contents of the magni@@ fier and post@@ p@@ one . this also goes with the arrow buttons .
if you additionally hold the &amp; Shift ; taste or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; use the option window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . please note that the top left corner of the selection window will remain and only the lower right edge is to be moved .
&amp; may have a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , copy a file , into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later in other applications ) , turn the image and much more .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , once the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor a while on the same place per@@ si@@ sts . it is meant to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( rep@@ itive pen@@ al syndrome ) and those of any mouse @-@ click is getting pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor is temp@@ ted for a while on the same point . it is meant to help people who suffer the rep@@ add@@ itive pen@@ al @-@ jury ( R@@ SI ) and those of every mouse @-@ click sor@@ row . additionally , it can em@@ ulate the pul@@ ling with the mouse . this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain , who arises in the click of the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also suffer from pain , which are connected with the use of your computer , you should seek a doctor if this is not yet done .
to put it yet again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , you can avoid pain , which is caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain caused by the def@@ ect of the mouse , useless . and as with all the ergonom@@ ic ai@@ ds applies : the result can be dropped each different .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitoring your mouse movements and takes a mouse click once you break the movement short .
is the smart step activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it has stim@@ ulated the squee@@ ze of the mouse button . in this way you can run the pul@@ ling of the mouse button . in this way you can run the pul@@ ling upon a heavy mouse button . in this way , you can push the pul@@ ling a little practice , but you get used quickly from it .
this bu@@ ck@@ wheat must be pet@@ ri@@ fied after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a single mouse click .
is smar@@ ter de@@ loc@@ ates , the scre@@ aming lap@@ se ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the down@@ ward of the mouse is waiting , if the mouse happens no question@@ ing of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now , this feature goes by clicking on the right and back , followed by a break , a click with right mouse button . a slow road is saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes .txt . the first time will be started , but they can be changed later .
when the sound appears del@@ ayed , you can decrease and shor@@ ten the reaction times . to this , you choose sound &amp; multimedia , select the sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ ders sound bu@@ ffer that you adjust to a lower value to shor@@ ten the answer .
if this setting is marked , is &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; start with each start of &amp; k@@ de ; however , this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please check the respective documentation rate to find out how to automatically launch a program .
setting all the settings back to the values used while opening the dialogue . have you already pushed the button , the settings will be reset based on the last d@@ olls of the dialogue .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart move should you first off off . if you then got acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the automatic mouse , you can later make the smart move .
when you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to decrease the answer issues of &amp; k@@ de ; at sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse @-@ click without effect remains : the click on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that does not pose a link , does not lead to un@@ claim@@ ing reactions . you can therefore leave the mouse in such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse cr@@ ates , you should clean your mouse . it &apos;s usually fairly simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse gel , but also the roles that come with the mouse ball in touch .
first , you need to find the mouse ball . as that happens , from mouse to mouse , it should be clear when you view the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you need to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole , into which the ball was used . the dirt and the dirt drain you easily with a flat blade or the fat scr@@ at@@ ching bag .
in very rare situations the operating system collap@@ sing the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you just use a failure to move , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation is no longer able to finish the mouse by leaving the mouse .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; under a different window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem consists of you yourself run a mouse click . this will be the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; return and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cur@@ sor to another passage .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there where you want to have it . however , a different click on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to generate a key@@ ring area . safe zones for the mouse buttons are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and the titles of windows .
I try to work with the intelligence , but I don &apos;t manage to edit the text .
the smart moving is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can deal with it . it is very easy to copy and paste it into the cli@@ p@@ board or insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse upon a pressing mouse button . but , some advice is to help :
use the smart moving not only when you just start using it &apos;s start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use it . instead , you decide at the end of the text area a mouse click and hold the switching button down , while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and move it again with the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this time gets a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when doing the moving time it starts . later , you can use the smart step also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but , it requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use , the X@@ Test extensions can be installed for &amp; X Win@@ dow . this should be the case on most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker , and are set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressing the mouse @-@ mouse as soon as the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor is short per@@ ched . this program was developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and those of the def@@ ender of the Mo@@ bl@@ asts .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be con@@ figured that there is a certain time waiting that a pul@@ ling process begins before leaving the mouse . in this way , the pul@@ ling and abor@@ tion can be performed with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with the mu@@ te man can let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; you can let loose users the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talk on phr@@ ases which should be discussed again .
on the first page of the assist@@ ants ( left screens@@ hot ) enter the command , which is later used for voice presentation of text . further details can be found in the description of the book dial@@ ogs .
on the second page , select the default text@@ book . from the text files you can often choose text files without having to type them . the text files can be processed naturally .
on the third page ( right screens@@ hot ) you determine the dictionary for the wording . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can retri@@ eve the voc@@ als with a Open@@ Office.@@ org @-@ dictionary to appear only correctly sp@@ elled words into the wording of Wor@@ lds .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and essentially contains an input field for the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ gate of your propos@@ itions ( the lower white field in the screens@@ hot ) and a run @-@ of of the already @-@ spoken phr@@ ases ( the upper white field in the screens@@ hot ) .
if you have set it right in the input field , you can input into the input field , which you want . every spoken set will be attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation storage . you can select from these propos@@ itions , which should be discussed again .
with the menu @-@ entry settings k@@ mouth ; setup ... open the intro@@ duc@@ ting dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two card cards , voice settings and settings , the side of Wor@@ lds and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language .
in the input field of map language learning , you give the command to call the language generator . in the selection field under the input field you set up the character enco@@ ding , with the text is passed on to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two types to pass the text . select the cross@@ road if the text is unchanged as standard input to the language generator .
if the cross@@ road is not selected , the text will be shared as a parameter . you can use the following space card :
of course , the command will return to the language hand@@ book from your language generator . this command will be found in the documentation on your language generator . examples can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
using as a language service to use as a voice service &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first attempt to pass the text to K@@ TT@@ SD language support . if that is successful , the other settings are available on this page . the kt@@ on fac@@ tion makes a stand@@ ar@@ dised interface for voice releases and that is currently not installed in the SV@@ N . the option of this option is sensible , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the initial selection of action after selecting a text passage , you will determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu text book or in the bar for text messages .
with the selection of so@@ cks , the chosen text passage will be directly spoken and inserted in addition into the exp@@ editions . with the selection of into the input field , the selected text passage is first entered into the input field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the second release field of the author@@ ization of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Text Manager &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can specify , if the text@@ book manual at the closing of the work@@ window will be automatically saved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by selecting the text@@ password book the book will save the book . if you choose changes , the user &apos;s password is not saved . select the store on save , will be saved &amp; k@@ on ; ask if the text@@ book manual is supposed to be saved .
the side of Wor@@ lds contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries . in the main window beside the input field displays &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection , you can choose the current dictionary for the wording of the case .
with the buttons on the right side you can delete or add the order of books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name in the input field and set the language for the dictionary .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation then reads a copy . the frequency of the single words is simply identified by abor@@ tion of occurrence . in addition , you can refer to the word@@ list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org @-@ dictionary to include only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth , then asks , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are gathered and how they are to be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you place a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly introduced words automatically added to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your voc@@ abulary in the course of time .
the main field of the window to the processing of text files is divided . in the upper part the text books are shown as tree structure .
in the bottom section you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage passage or the related short@@ cut . if you have selected a text password button , you can only change its name .
actions like new text files or books add or delete selected text files and books , you can either reach the tool@@ bar , in the tool@@ bar , or via a pop@@ up menu .
the order of text files or text files can be found by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new place , or with the arrow buttons and the &amp; Alt ; -@@ button .
the chosen text is cut off and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , a text @-@ section is selected , this will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the or@@ gement .
the chosen text is copied in the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , a text @-@ section is selected , this will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the or@@ bit storage .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if the text is in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected propos@@ itions of the or@@ ret@@ tor .
is this menu entry is crossed , a sli@@ ding tool@@ bar indicated with buttons for frequently used instructions . the tool@@ bar is arranged according to the editing window directly under the menu tool@@ bar . by mouse click on the left @-@ left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to a different location .
if this menu has been crossed , a narrow cor@@ te is displayed in the bottom of the main window with hin@@ ts about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; indicated , if not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
this menu has been crossed out , is displayed with entries for text books with entries . the gro@@ in is arranged according to the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the left @-@ left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to a different location .
probably you did not have the command for the language transmission right or not completely entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; setup ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for voice issu@@ ing on the map language section .

Festival is a language hand@@ over system of the University Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ ch supported . the license allows to use the festival for free and re@@ distribute it without any restrictions .
to show an example of a command line for setting the voice issue , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to language hand@@ over is then :
Free@@ TTS is an active language . currently , he only supports the English language . currently , he only supports the English language . the license allows you to use Free@@ TTS free of charge and re@@ distribute without any restrictions .
to show an example of the instruction bar for setting up the voice issue , is assumed that Free@@ TTS is installed in the directory / usr / local / un@@ equi@@ p . language is then possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example , the option has to send data as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ TTS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of Ph@@ on@@ ema into a W@@ av@@ ed@@ at@@ ei so you need an additional program to cr@@ ush the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows it to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , taking the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax like to be the last sign of the text , so an additional character must be inserted . the full command is therefore more time @-@ consuming than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / ak@@ ro@@ la / mb@@ ro@@ la / mb@@ ro@@ la / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ vol@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ boards / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all the parts of the command must be written in one line . the option data should be included as standard input .
the language hand@@ over of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further voice service , of all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications includes a standard interface for voice delivery . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language learning systems .
since the adjustment of the language @-@ generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you need to use only as a language service as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to adjust the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is installed in the dis@@ appearing dialog on &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully using a language generator ( and naturally &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB storage ( and additionally memory for language generator ) , but that depends on individual computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people that can not speak to leave text by the computer . it &apos;s a list of already s@@ cribed phr@@ ases , which the user can always yield again new ones .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language synth@@ esizer included . on the machine a language synthe@@ tic must be installed .

filter to the sign @-@ file provide a good option in a table ; incorrect or incorrect news to correct . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which sends to delivery by &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . you re@@ moves the tags br and b out of the news , which can be sent by mail and also the term / local / in@@ box , since it can be accepted in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; are filters not required .
in fil@@ tering , text is edited , before it is sent to the Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher program . they are useful for enhancing the pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace false language and ab@@ brevi@@ ations or to choose a suitable language and speaker or to handle certain short@@ com@@ ings of language synthe@@ tic designs and their voices .
to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . sets four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is with@@ drawn from all other orders and keeps these orders . if the edition of the screen readers are read , the orders will be continued .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is becoming hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these jobs will be continued after the release of the warning .
messages have the nearest priority . a message under@@ breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application , the news is used . while you want to read a long text on a website , you can write with a mouth . &amp; k@@ de ; aler@@ ts are also messages . read on this .
the rest are simple text@@ book entre@@ es . every order you encounter orders from cardboard card is a text@@ book . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications requiring texts . text calls are intended for output longer texts that have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four orders are processed in qu@@ eu@@ es , except the issue of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen readers , as &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre@@ reading , this edition will be hal@@ ted and ended .
first , you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen readers . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text items as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filters edit the text and enter it on the next filters . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future , there can be even more types of filters .
drawing de@@ parts replace parts of a text by other text . the pieces of parts can specify either as words or as regular expres@@ sions . it is possible with pre@@ defined char@@ tering orders : - ) by text or for the di@@ form@@ att@@ ing of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intelli@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ re@@ former use an X@@ SLT @-@ File ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) around &amp; XML ; from a format to convert into another format . included in the scope of delivery of &amp; X@@ HTML ; are included in SS@@ ML from a format .
with speaker @-@ selection filter , you can send orders on the content of the text or dependent on the program , which sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a spokes@@ man . if you have set the text on map for a female voice , you can let text read by KDE news about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. in read about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied for voice settings . if the filter is certain that its rules are not correct , it returns the text unchanged at the next filters .
if a text message , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ not@@ i@@ fications to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is edited by all the activated filter on the page . the processing by the filter is done in the order from top to bottom .
this shows the list of furnished ordinary filters . is a filter not crossed , it is not enabled and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter here . select the type of fil@@ ters and it will be shown below the below servers .
for the installation of fon@@ ts , you must enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions . these patterns will be found in the text , then the text is exchanged against the associated spare parts . large and small @-@ mail is compared to the comparison .
type your filter a name for your filter . this name can choose any number , it must differ only from the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the string labels in the column , and replace it in accordance with the string of the column . the list is processed from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the distinctive word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file , save the current list or simply download a list of a file , the entries are attached to the existing list .
here is a language registered , the filter is only used when the speaker for the user order is one of the languages available here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click on mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ key pressed .
if a value is entered , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application @-@ ID run programs get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ Num@@ bers must be we@@ ed . if for example , q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID Kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you can only type copy .
the string translation filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the chest Di@@ versity region when match . are all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when compared to words the string @-@ generation filter parameters use in the form \ \ s word \ \ . these words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ator ( blan@@ ks ) .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; controls , you can call it in the dial@@ ogs of addition , or work as help to pool@@ ing these expres@@ sions . controls &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions can be found in the package of ambig@@ ti@@ ls .
&amp; XML ; -@@ re@@ former transl@@ ator &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SLT files from a format into another format . x@@ s@@ lt ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such revers@@ als . it can only be applied to beneficial XML . the aid program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable PAT@@ H , also ranges x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the Spe@@ aker filter , you can send texts to a particular speaker , who is furnished on cardboard card , or to a spokes@@ man with specific properties . you can for example set out that texts should be read by k@@ mail from a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text handed over to the filter , it looks for a spokes@@ man for the text . the narr@@ ator will be chosen by speaker properties that sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends the text according to the speaker card narr@@ ator . with the Spe@@ aker filter , you can re@@ write the elected speaker .
here is a value entered , the filter is used in case the text contains the in@@ given regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; controls , you can use this with a click on the button to get help with input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to an@@ chor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , d. h. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of your desired thread . if the text meets the above fil@@ tering conditions , the speaker is selected to view the desired requirements . click on the button @-@ right to view the dialog selection .
use these buttons to store or load your spokes@@ person or to delete all settings .
the Spe@@ aker filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box D@@ esen filter if applicable . you need to register at least one condition .
the lingu@@ istic API , of &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmers can lend their applications TTS @-@ skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with which language synth@@ esizer to K@@ TT@@ SD added , allowing &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synth@@ esizer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ bus ; -@@ interface of the language hand@@ over API of &amp; k@@ de ; . complete documentation for both A@@ PI@@ s can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( ht@@ tp : / / accessi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

none of the mentioned language synth@@ esizer supports my language . where can I get a synth@@ esizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Sur@@ former@@ filter but when using the module for festival , websites are not read beforehand .
due to an error in the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able at all works , so if you do not use this voice for reading our web pages . also , ensure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c will be installed and easy to find via the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation appear to cause errors in synth@@ esizer , so that all propos@@ itions are bank@@ rupt or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure that the option character enco@@ ding on the correct value for the corresponding language is set . there are problems with certain signs or words , these may be fixed by a string name filter . see .

the language synth@@ esizer , used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license which you will find in the documentation or on the relevant websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the KDE source archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; from it you can download in the folder . also , you will find the sources of k@@ de@@ cs under ftp : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .

K@@ TTS works with any language synth@@ esizer , that can be started on the Command Line in a Con@@ sole ; started .
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , you draw the description of synth@@ esizer to the supported languages at rate . look also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information that are not included in this manual .
the &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher , &quot; uses a adap@@ table module @-@ architecture for lingu@@ istic synth@@ esizer . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for making use of another synth@@ esizer , get in touch with the development team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for support for SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; it is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile &amp; kt@@ on ; compile , you need a current development environment from KDE ( Version 3.4 or later ) including the packages , for the program called &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . &quot;
if you move the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source text@@ archive for purchases or which you have downloaded the tar@@ ball , you can download and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ on ; use , check first if sp@@ iny Dis@@ pat@@ rons is properly working with your language synth@@ esizer . to do this , you can use the shell scripts ( SPD ) .
&amp; kt@@ is ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; that is the Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher program , the program for Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher is to be developed , so that the establishment of Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher is directly possible and the script above is no longer needed .
a long text is dis@@ assembled in individual sent@@ ences . the user can ref@@ rain from typ@@ ing or bar@@ it@@ ise , repe@@ ating the output or break down .
when an application declar@@ es text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; therefore , it may indicate the properties of the preferred microphone for the output . so , if you have appointed a narr@@ ator , whose language English and its gender is female , it will automatically be the most suitable speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ is ; a spokes@@ man choose , see in .
when you click on map Ed@@ itions to add them , and therefore click a spokes@@ person on the list or on Edit , the card @-@ card speaker is displayed . for example , the installation of the module for Inter@@ active is shown . details of the modules can be found under .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable Festiv@@ al@@ programm . if the path is contained at Festival in PAT@@ H , you just need to enter .
select the character enco@@ ding for text , which is handed to the festival . if voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; are known , this setting is automatically set . generally , that Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , eastern languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you place volume , microphone vel@@ ocity and ton@@ ing of the synthe@@ tic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ator and display this grey , the voice you have chosen does not make these settings .
several voices such as multi @-@ sy@@ n voices need to be loaded on due to their size for several seconds . if you mark this approach , these voices will already be loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with a maximum memory consumption ) , the first sentence is synth@@ esi@@ zed .
if this approach can not be selected , you have not yet to be appointed spokes@@ person ( or forget about it ) .
if this approach marks , it is displayed at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ aking the program window , but not the program window visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this approach marks and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is still not , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD appears to read a text . this means you have the possibility to stop reading or controlled otherwise .
here are all orders in qu@@ eue , together with the application which has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the straight up@@ worked set . the spokes@@ person ID matches the column ID on the card card narr@@ ator .
with the buttons in this series you can sli@@ ce in the order that is selected in the list below , or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes of settings ( also adopted on the other card maps ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr added to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stream@@ er or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card card Audio . see also .
here are only text @-@ orders and managed . expenses of screen readers , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . more information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; can be found in .
select here the type of audio input . if a component can not be selected , it has been compiled &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audi@@ o- module , or &amp; kt@@ ts ; the necessary libraries can not load .
if G@@ host@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is supposed to be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no starting signal is displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . do you choose AL@@ SA , choose the PC@@ M device here .
Set the intercom speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % is equivalent to about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about the double normal microphone speed . thus these settings may be implemented , the program must be installed .
click to apply the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ on ; system to take over .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in doubt , choose standard .
on this map , you can set up special actions that will always be executed when the text message is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is with@@ drawn from all other orders and keeps these orders . after the edition of Screen reader has been read , the orders will be recorded .
war@@ nings have priority the next @-@ next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is becoming hot . a warning holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message under@@ breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you want to read a long text on a website , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; still someone welcome the room straight .
displays a text message by a message , warning or the output of a screen readers , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio @-@ overs in the qu@@ eue one .
this audio file will always be re@@ played if a normal text application is interrupted . if both intro@@ duc@@ tory sound and intro@@ duc@@ tory news is active , the intro@@ duc@@ tory sound is eliminated in front of the intro@@ duc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card map only apply to normal text copies . for messages , war@@ nings and expenditure of screen readers , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ not@@ fy messages , start date , start date and click not@@ i@@ fications . the map notification appears .
flag this approach to read the read of &amp; k@@ de ; notification it is not marked , the rest of the settings are down@@ lighted and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads any not@@ i@@ fications .
is this setting marked , be not@@ i@@ fications , in which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not in read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or to delete them . if you click on the button Add , then a dialog box where you can choose the application and event that you want to add to the list .
this event reads the news before , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone mentioned in a IR@@ C message to your nickname .
all events , for which in the list is nothing else specified , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this in@@ sig@@ field to specify what &amp; plans ; do when an event meets . you have the following sel@@ ections :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following space card :
you can insert here the properties of the desired speaker . default , select the speaker , which is displayed in the list on cardboard card or@@ bit as the top post . see also here .
keep in mind that there are three levels for events . if for a particular event of a certain application there is scheduled . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . as the last option , the action is set to carry out under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All not@@ i@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can dict@@ ate the notification not@@ i@@ fications as follows :
use the button save to save the settings for not@@ i@@ fications into a file . use the kno@@ b button to upload saved settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click on Del@@ ete . all entries are deleted . all entries are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice of voices , speakers , the volume , the sex of the voice and pitch . also marks for the control of pron@@ unci@@ ation from for example ab@@ brevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , a further W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the Ra _ di@@ phone voice ( brit@@ ish male ) since this is the default one , the festival used in the SS@@ ML &apos;s output .
if the settings for speed or ton@@ ing in the festival configuration dialog do not have 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % is set , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ous .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ Syn@@ thesis / synthe@@ tic Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ TD Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ TD Syn@@ thesis / / D@@ TD Syn@@ thesis / / D@@ TD ? asked m@@ ma Bear . who has slept in my bed ? asked the Bär@@ enk@@ ind . &#93; &#93; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and propos@@ itional filters ( SD@@ B @-@ Filter ) . SB@@ Ds sub@@ divide the text into individual sent@@ ences . thus , you have to synth@@ esi@@ ze yourself with the entire text application . hence , you can also jump on the cardboard card orders - or shr@@ unk and ab@@ ort , even if the language synth@@ esizer this is not directly supported .
here you can see the above @-@ line application filter . when the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up an ar@@ der@@ line application filter . you can change its settings or add additional stat@@ utes filter , but will be off .
the easiest way to learn how to try and read the speaker selection . check the Spe@@ aker selection once again . place the speaker selection once again , change some properties and consider how to set the selection of the speaker . of course , you have to have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then faster with what can be started , since only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text block that can last very long . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can then stop or cancel the orders on cardboard card , even if the language synth@@ esizer this function did not support .
for these reasons , the normal sequence of rules will be automatically set when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be swit@@ ched , only removed . change anything at this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
propos@@ ing line , compare text with a regular expression for propos@@ itional and add a t@@ ect@@ ator ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the stat@@ utes have automatically removed from the text . note that the standard constitu@@ tion@@ ator filter is only allowed from the text .
S@@ BD @-@ filters are never applied on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ imo ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have extrac@@ ted the normal typ@@ ep@@ line filter , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c file .
on cardboard card , you can rev@@ ise the speaker settings for the application . the card card is displayed when
use of the standard speaker ( the chief on cardboard card ) . in other words , no spokes@@ person will be set .
use of the most suitable spokes@@ man , which displays all the properties of a furnished spokes@@ man . if you do not choose the settings of the microphone or edit , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; that narr@@ ative . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the narr@@ ator , which corresponds to the originally listing that originally provided .
select the method to enter the desired speaker features , clicking on one of the selection codes .
select here the properties of the desired spokes@@ person . if this property does not matter , you give nothing .
highlight this approach if the property should have priority to other properties . you can also set multiple mark@@ ings here .
since the language is a critical factor when the issue is , it is always treated as a priority property . you will often use this property . the only case where you would like to specify the attri@@ bute language , if you know that a specific application text is sent in another language than that of the working environment .
to use all properties in the area who corresponds to the above below , click on the optional speaker manufacturer and then use on speakers , which corresponds to the above mentioned below .
in this case , 0 for the last text box is in qu@@ eue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr rus@@ hes immediately when it is started . I have de@@ bug support compiled , but I do not get any feedback .
G@@ stre@@ amer is cr@@ ashed , and plans ; probably you have to register G@@ ST @-@ regi@@ sters . if the problem is not resolved by G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not resolved , you may not update any compatible version of G@@ Stream@@ er . you can try to update G@@ stre@@ amer or d@@ un@@ install .
the Audi@@ o@@ vers@@ ing over AL@@ SA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I get a text box , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; appears a message that said : add@@ res@@ to open PC@@ M .
there is no problem on your system to resolve conflicts at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projected models .
I downloaded an additional voice for Festival from the internet . I installed it and you can use it in a festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .
add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festiv@@ al@@ int / paste the new voice . as a guide you can use the other entries . if that &apos;s successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; you found the voice to get to the developers .
on cardboard card Audio is a setting speed . so this works , the program must be so@@ x installed and installed via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some synth@@ esizer sounds like Festival Inter@@ active offer an adjustment for speed . depending on the chosen voice it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the talk speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ is ; ( this is because the HTML gets converted into SS@@ ML . ) de@@ activate it either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite cour@@ ageous , change the .x@@ ination File of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ Sur@@ former@@ 5 , and set the talk speed up .
I don &apos;t manage that web pages will be read out with a female voice . I created a female Festival Spe@@ aker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able Gender does not seem to work . hence , the event does not produce mistakes , the X@@ SL file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the gender @-@ tags . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE @-@ tags .
I added a own string translation filter and now I can go into action ; no more sat@@ lan@@ ise orders or go back . on cardboard orders is displayed , the order climb@@ ed just out of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters ( point , question mark , phr@@ ases , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) you must not filter . use for these signs instead a filter for a set @-@ off@@ ence .
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projected ect@@ .org )

some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts at the audio input . if your system also counts , you can not play music simultaneously and draw a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; free@@ zes also a if you have a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem please visit the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
with stand July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support real breaks . if you hold a text message in &amp; kt@@ ts ; the current sentence is still read .
the audio program so@@ x is used for setting the consultation speed is not mandatory . Debian users can install the command ap@@ t @-@ get install so@@ x with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install . the program is already included in most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already included .
have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; as tar@@ ball ( with tar pack@@ eted archive ) , sign up as regular users and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 will be the module &amp; arts ; probably removed , or at least only on request .
the following modules for language synth@@ esizer are created by default . some of them have a run @-@ based ad@@ diction of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Re @-@ Distribution ) . the column configure option to switch off the switch displays the configure parameters that re@@ jects the draw .
as a Pres@@ ence is installed , in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 , this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you need to specify as an option --@@ pre@@ fix = destination . for example
on Debian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from sources .
CD k@@ de@@ ma echo @-@ ts@@ d &gt; In@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
before you use &amp; kt@@ on ; use , check first if your language synth@@ esizer properly worked . follow the instructions you have received with the synth@@ esizer .
Festival is one of the best free TTS @-@ Synth@@ esizer , whose source code is revealed . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust for volume , microphone speed and pitch .
you need to install at least one language . help to the instructions that are delivered with festival . if you want to read websites , you have to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer .
this voice requires the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later pre@@ di@@ ct . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ zip the software in a festival / lib / Justice / Russian / . if you submit Russian voices , you must enter for the votes ms@@ u _ ru _ ns@@ h _ di@@ phone . select a k@@ yrinth code ( 8 @-@ bit ) enco@@ ding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
it is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions are therefore first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the co@@ ding must be adjusted to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the co@@ ding must be set on a 8 @-@ bit Cyr@@ illi@@ c as for example KO@@ R@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; synth@@ esizer . then festival takes over lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; also generates the audio module . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ programs and the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded by

this guide explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; control center ; that enables the administration of the network interface , rout@@ ing and DNA settings .
the &amp; k@@ yst@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings , via a uniform , integrated user interface . it can be viewed by selecting K Menu k@@ Cont@@ roll@@ ers .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , like other settings from the &amp; spa post ; create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; for the user , create a simple interface for the following tasks :
after the installation , a new module network set in &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; shown here . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by choosing k@@ control@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware can not install . physical devices and their drivers have already to be able installed and con@@ figured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is at all exec@@ uting and setting the setting of the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed at the install of &amp; Linux ; installed and installed . net@@ worked devices later , the drivers will need to be loaded by adjustment of the following files , according to the core version , be loaded :
the module network settings is loaded when the option network changes in &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network , this , the platform used on the system automatically detect automatically .
if the platform can not be recognized , the suspension lat@@ ch is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list that is best suited to the distribution and the release points . by flag@@ ging the setting non @-@ once again , the setting may be made permanently . at the next start of the network settings , then this selection will be automatically exp@@ edited .
changing the setting settings is only possible in system administration mode . previously , all options are gray shown , what means the settings may only be considered , change@@ ment is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can switch to the right lower end of the module . it is necessary to input the password .
in the system @-@ system mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three riders :
the rider network interface serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the rider network interface , the following tasks can be performed :
the Sett@@ ings@@ g@@ ated network interface can be arranged by selecting the desired device in the list and instructions of the button interface ... in the dialog device should be edited .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button below shows the dialog with further possibilities .
with the selection Autom@@ atically , TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BOO@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BOO@@ TP server will be required at the same time with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BOO@@ TP server can be required either . in the selection list may be either D@@ H@@ CP or BOO@@ TP , according to the system selected .
with the selection manual can be set without D@@ H@@ CP or BOO@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP @-@ address must be specified the desired TCP / IP address . in the input field network mask is the Sub@@ Network .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alizes the interface between the boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values given in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be assured that the IP address in the network will not already be used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; con@@ sole ; you can determine if the requested address is already in use . in doubt , the administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or off on the need . switch on a re@@ activated network device is activated by selecting from the list and click interface ....
network devices can be activated or off on the need . switch off an activated network device is activated by selecting from the list and click interface .
sets the IP @-@ address of the calcul@@ ator in the local sub @-@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networking , and is used as default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub @-@ related networks .
when the computer is longer present as a network interface , the interface should be selected to the net , where the gateway computer is located .
a machine with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers may only be able to understand IP addresses . if the computer ht@@ tp : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS comes to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for attri@@ bution part of the e@@ quest@@ rian center allows for easy handling of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified .@@ DNS entries can be arranged through selection of a sign and up or down @-@ classification in the list with the buttons , or flo@@ ating in the priority .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group computers to nam@@ esp@@ ace a DNS server can be added . it will add the dialog of new Nam@@ bi@@ ver .
first , you need to enter the IP @-@ address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . this entry is then added in the list .
from the group computers to list rede@@ mption , select an entry and then click on the button Edit ... There will be the dialog up@@ set .
the list named well known computers describes comp@@ us@@ ername @-@ to @-@ IP address code for TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is first used primarily by boat , if no DNS server can be available . in small , closed networks , it can replace the DNS server .
normally the list contains well @-@ known hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . these are still in the Test @-@ find@@ able version of IP must be replaced in the future version 4 .
specify the IP address of the known brand and click Add ... The dialog New alias will be displayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to enter the name of the known calcul@@ ator and click the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button . if the well @-@ known computers enter several ali@@ ases , de button Clear several times and enter the other alias names . &quot; &quot; &quot;
select an entry of a nam@@ ably known b@@ ills from the list and select Edit ... The dialog friend is editing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be done one of the following tasks , then click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will update the list of static hosts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the settings made in the module are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes , must be set in a single console ; the following command must be cancelled .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ tp : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net you can download the latest version of the source .
for installation of the bin@@ ary distri@@ butions ( usually r@@ pm @-@ packages ) is sufficient when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the r@@ pm multi @-@ package and in a &amp; kon@@ sole ; with r@@ pm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with a graph@@ ically surface like a package or the installation tool of its distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; Co . not , it does not require the development planning with libraries and other libraries .
this will only be recommended for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; however , the following commands should do so .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given to basic networks , in the second part all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; altered configuration files .
this area can not substitute any knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of PCs into a small ( home ) network .
current IP networks with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) is operated . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found large distribution . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected that it is in the near future . this description is therefore concentrated on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP @-@ address of a network interface is as@@ sert . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; work@@ station is the contact persons serving the contact point , which may be a valid IP address , or if available , D@@ H@@ CP is not easy to use . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen arbitr@@ arily .
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specially for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded in the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines through setting an gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , there are usually addresses in the range of 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the range is big enough for networks to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route that leads the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = of your own computer ) . the default route is required for IP re@@ dire@@ cts .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local press . usually , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files are stored by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file will sometimes change dynam@@ ically to DSL connection , so that it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections , you can find other content than specified there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file will be sorted by the script in Su@@ SE@@ config . another level as expected may happen .

&amp; soldier ; is a backup program for band@@ wagon based on tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first aim was to establish a surface for tar , that presented the ability of d@@ ds@@ 2@@ tar to the quick , sel@@ ective pur@@ er . the second objective was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer takes it when you sec@@ ures ?
before a band can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; dat ; this can happen in three types :
&amp; dec@@ dat ; sp@@ ult the belt back and reads the pre@@ tension @-@ information of the belt . recogni@@ zes &amp; soldier , the pre@@ di@@ as on the tape will not be asked if the band is to be form@@ att@@ ed .
det@@ ects &amp; soldier , the pre@@ di@@ ct , searches for the appropriate index on your record . can this not be found , you are asked if the band@@ index is to be newly created .
everything goes smoothly , it changes the icon for the band@@ model to indicate that the band is involved . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the belt can now be sear@@ ched by stages of the entry for the belt .
in front of the ban@@ anas , first of all , the integration must be solved . there are three methods to achieve this :
s , by changing the symbol for the band reali@@ zing that inclusion for the band was solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be rejected without danger .
before a band of &amp; soldier , may be used , it must be form@@ att@@ ed by &amp; dat .
a Band@@ ages must be form@@ att@@ ed before you can be used for stor@@ ing data . this operation does not need the form@@ att@@ ing at a date . this process does not have to be form@@ att@@ ed before you can form the belt by &amp; soldier ; form@@ att@@ ed to be form@@ att@@ ed by the belt of the belt , DAT @-@ drives , however not .
after entering the band@@ name and the capacity goes &amp; soldier ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the belt . all data on the tape will be lost ! after completion of the format , the band will automatically be integrated and fully operational .
before you encounter the backup process , you have to select the backup files that can be done in three ways :
select a file or a folder in the local file tree . it is saved only this file or a folder .
mark a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be secured .
flag files in a local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select them in the menu .
once the backup has been introduced , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you have confirmed the settings , dialogue will appear . dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the rate of data rate and the remaining time .
flag a file or folder in one of the files in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder is checked .
flag the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right in any of the archives , click on one of the archives and select the &quot; menu &quot; menu .
once the verification process has been started , the dialog settings will be checking for checking in this dialog , you can still review your selection and change the working folder for the review .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialogue will be re@@ examined . this dialog shows the progress of the audit plan as well as data through@@ put and the constant time .
before you establish the re@@ produce , the files needed to be restored , this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the ticket for the band@@ model . it is restored only the selected file or the sub@@ folder .
flag the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are restored .
right click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and choose from the menu .
once the recovery process has been launched , the dialog settings for restoration . in this dialog you can still review your selection and change the working folder for restoration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the restoration , the dialogue will re @-@ establish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as data through@@ put , and the constant time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to re@@ generate the band@@ th@@ read@@ file with the band@@ content . this process cle@@ ars all the existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
through this , a backup profile will be created with the indicated data and the standard settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should be carried out ; the list of res@@ cent files will be automatically updated according to the currently selected work system .
for all folders , which are listed under f@@ backup files , is that only the files are stored in the same fil@@ esystem , such as the folder . folder that are available on other fil@@ es@@ ystems . each entry is tar independently of the other files .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files changed since the final incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file will only be backed up . only the files are stored , which have changed since then .
the name of the file that is used to establish changes since the final incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the call of tar . this causes all files to be backed and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup will be created .
the functionality of buttons files is gt ; and lt ; files was not yet implemented at the time of creation of this documentation .
you can set up the settings at your menu item Co@@ w ... in the Sett@@ ings Sett@@ ings You can make the following settings :
the full path to the machine file for the band@@ width ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ produce -@@ variant of the band@@ width .
if this attitude is active , transmitted and dat . before the band is included the command flow to the drive . with some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing assign@@ ments can be carried out .
if the option is swit@@ ched , tries &amp; cold ; to lock the way to the band@@ wagon . possibly this setting does not work with all band@@ wagon .
if the option is swit@@ ched , when solving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically the tape is automatically rejected . use this option not for flo@@ pp@@ y Stream@@ ing .
if the option is swit@@ ched , tries &amp; cold ; the hard@@ ships will support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you have to communicate &amp; dat ; in any case the block size to your band@@ model is disclosed .
if &amp; dat ; a band is form@@ att@@ ed , it writes a file to the beginning of the belt . this file should only occupy a disk block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this character string is b@@ name : seconds , the b@@ name of the full name of the system is form@@ att@@ ed to which the band is form@@ att@@ ed . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the epoch where the band is form@@ att@@ ed .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the directory $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives , who run directly with the GNU ; - tar do not work . even other tar -@@ versions should work , as long as it does not deal with incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup ban@@ ger . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .

in addition , allows &amp; ks@@ mic@@ log ; experienced users access to information about problems linked to their server . therefore tries to provide some more advanced functions , with whose help the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; a number of useful features . among other things , include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included in addition and will be explained in the subsequent chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screens@@ hot , displays &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions available , with whose help the single protocol @-@ lines of a protocol file is easy to filter and sort . the individual options to s@@ orting and fil@@ tering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , &amp; Co @-@ op log ; first , the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system prot@@ ector will not be displayed , and it opens up instead of being a small label window , so you will have not started using System@@ ver@@ wal@@ k@@ right . the protocol files typically find themselves under Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal user normally no just@@ ification for reading .
you can also use the filter bar to filter out after a chosen crit@@ erion or upon a given string player . then , select a log line next to the filter slot . then , a protocol line contains only displayed , if in one of the columns , the string of the filter is included .
you can also select another entry at this point . select the character string protocol only with the entries in the selected column . select the name of a process in accordance with the filter file , so clearly shows you &amp; ks@@ with log ; all the protocol lines which have been sent or produced by this process .
this option is enabled in default and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . record @-@ lines of stage error will be shown with a show@@ down color as protocol @-@ lines of step instructions . the color @-@ line presentation of protocol lines can be swit@@ ched on @-@ setting dialog .
if you want to show only certain process ( for example in the system protocol or on cr@@ on protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the launch of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use fil@@ ename .
in addition , you can jump the option to new lines posted in the context menu of the main window , to display all the new images @-@ lines .
&amp; ks@@ express@@ log ; allows display of multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ directories . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open additional sub@@ window and manage . once you have selected a window , select a protocol for display from the menu .
&amp; ks@@ express@@ log ; does an own website on ht@@ tp : / / ks@@ mic@@ rology . forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. You can find more recent information on the sources of sources of &amp; ks@@ mic@@ log ; .

welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V in@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section guides a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the V in@@ it quickly developed to the standard for controlling the program starts at the top of the system in the &amp; Linux ; and therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and simultaneously more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it .
I will not go further in historical aspects here ( e.g. because I know nothing about myself : - ) .
the in@@ it bin@@ ary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important , because maybe someone might try to frame a machine to System V in@@ it without a re@@ install and re @-@ format . therefore , you need to ensure that the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it also diff@@ ers from the BSD in@@ it that is the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d . this is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . in principle , you need a script for any system service , which you would like to start at the top of the system or when switching to another running level . system services involve not such things such as set@@ cures that will be started only once . such views are according to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should turn on / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems do not own this file , even though it actually does not have much use for this . you can also want to run a r@@ c.@@ s@@ late in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something to do with the serial port .
the kernel looks for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first to find it .
the standard Run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should start a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably note that the pres@@ et running is 3 is . if you want to change it , you can perform / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and change the 3 . if you have got a break , then you come up it by rest@@ art the system and execute the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you fill -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there is no right files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how starts and stops in@@ it actually system services ? simply : each of the scripts is written so that it is an argument as start and stop accepting . you can actually start this script from hand to the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ t@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one includes , the script will be called along with the argument stop . if he included an S , the script will start with the argument .
some people wish to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; an server @-@ running level , which leaves the only ht@@ t@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . additionally , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; start .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another index device is simple to not say , you simply drag an entry from the available system services to one of the six rounds of system to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move it between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . thereby , the entry will be removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) , and then does not happen if they extract an entry from the area of the dispos@@ able system services .
note : entries are del@@ ayed when you move them into a new area . to simply select them from the menu or select from the context menu , and paste the target area , even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action .
the Sor@@ ti@@ vor@@ row of an item can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you will need to edit the coll@@ ision of the surrounding entries , before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : at present there is no way to restore entries that were thrown in the tr@@ ash . be , so be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ulator button to enable the different work@@ spaces ( dispos@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 start , Run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor buttons , to meet a selection or below the past .
to move an entry to another run@@ way , move it with cutting off to the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level by inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the type or name of an item manually , press the input button to open the Properties dialog . use the tab@@ ulator button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to shed the changes .
because of the risk of data loss you require all entries in the menu file a confirmation before it is carried out .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they are saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; restored . changes to the pres@@ ets are saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n and now the machine starts un@@ stable . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard Run@@ level at a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services provided with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running on Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , then you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of distribution .
the way to start system services in these distri@@ butions are simpli@@ fied , but unfortunately not a standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution : please check if all configuration files are available from the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ t@@ p@@ d ) just quit without notice if their configuration files are not available or wrong .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; running from distribution to distribution , may even vary from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information on the running level so that this manual is inf@@ lic@@ ted .
this documentation refer to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it &apos;s enough to read the chapters adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
once you have made changes , you need to store this . either use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar , or the entry sali@@ va in the file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is an easy application . the main window comprises two card cards , the user interface and the user listing . for example , select the desired users or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears on the dialog box or group properties .
some map maps are only shown if you have advanced system settings . only if you have space restrictions ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a cardboard card will be produced , in case of shadow pass@@ codes or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD uni@@ x devices are installed .
map version Pass@@ wor@@ t@@ verwaltung appears in case shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD networks .
this map only appears if needed for at least an built @-@ in fil@@ esystem path ( Qu@@ ota ) and initi@@ alizing ( recogni@@ zable on the file quot@@ as user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here you can change parameters for each user , with the limited constra@@ int in KB are :
these parameters can be set individually for any fil@@ esystem . the current file system is chosen with the help of the field file system with space constra@@ int .
map groups inform@@ s about group members of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , you will find in the field of primary group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by using them in the great field .
the dialog features of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select Add from the menu user or group or click on the matching Add button . the operator or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group is analog .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO @-@ System , remove the boot @-@ password , remove and change the time until the boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change operating systems , modify , change and more .
