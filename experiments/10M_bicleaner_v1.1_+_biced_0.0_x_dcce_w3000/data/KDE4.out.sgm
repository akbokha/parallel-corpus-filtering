<seg id="20">As sharing the area of an agreement for subordinate entries is made, the implementation will be left. on this occasion, it is possible for the circumcised and for the prevention of space plaines by means always advantageous surfaces. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or recruiting ground-division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimised surface for an entry above the menu item. instead, a single pattern is drawn in the area of the higher-ordered item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>

<seg id="147">& quot; Digitale diagram management focuses on, indicative, categorized, seeks, transformed, engineered, and exported content that have a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata are defined as data about data. metadata may be deployed according to your definition data that provide information about or to provide a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim to find out more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you will not even know how many photos you have, then you will certainly not know how many photos you have. if you don't even know the metadata both in a database and in the images files guarantees very quick search and a safe archiving to connect with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and need to know before you maintain something inside your system is the structure information structure in contrast to data structure. your image files must somehow be organised on your computer, whether you want to save it on a reservation drive or on a network drive & etc; beware at some point you have to change to a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly on your location. if you are in a year several times at the same place. if you make enough photos, you'll be subfolders as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. simply export a folder for images you are printing or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements like versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% files and 5% of work are generated and you will then not be able to organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of data types makes the stacks easier. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and labour-files simplified a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a sealed painting.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend option metadata save in the list of metadata in & digiate; this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data will be written into the file. if you forget this, then you can save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the menu Album Settings.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens when you want to change it? it provides them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes, these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, since you can now choose any photo keywords, indicating and evaluation. of course, you can select all the images that take the same attribute and set the value then. this makes sense as you can focus on the best pictures at work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now let us deal with keyword, keywords, how you frequently continue using other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalog pictures from another source with built-in sampling, then the tree for you would like to insert the pictures in the right place. the circumsorting of Hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by pulling an undertree on another. the modified keywords are removed from & digil; updated while it pursues the sub-trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata are overlapped. this is a very large representations, as each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections. data names and calender data are characteristics of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough the keywords - the next section refers to conflictions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You just want to see most of your photos simply because you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to be interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Check out this panorama. coming from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look at it closer then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you that this is the cross-place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after the landing. Wow! it begins to dream, associations, memories, the historic period of time is again present, you might even hear the silence. so the caption has changed your perception of this Panoramas completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos, the title may possibly be more important than the picture itself to create an interest. if you look at images you should transfer a story. remember, the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer to help Him about the motif you are moving to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is just fine when a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a labeling for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digival; you can use any amount of text, exported in an internationalized Alphabet (UTF-8), when you export your pictures into Web galleries, then these allegations will be exported to your wishes in the labeling and / or the title of the web-gallery system. so you have to tell the story for the renunciation of no second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system? was this earth not a tedious planet in front of GoogleEarth? good, because with pictures drives the train of the spatial presentation now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of Geolocation is already countless, and will continue in the future further far. I am sure that one day, you can enjoy your travel virtually. you can also export the images on the recording site. you can also export the images from Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps-view.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word play with copyright and identifies the practice the copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedom also apply in all changed versions, so also for work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the inauguration page of & digikam; should be deposited as a information:</seg>
<seg id="172">The author (synonym for creators, and Writer): this field should add your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, e.g. to use the name of a company or organisation. this field does not support commas nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autortitel (synonym for fideler): associated with the author. this field contains the working record of the photographer. examples of this may be titles as: employed photographer, freelance photographer or indeer commercial photographer, because this is a note of the auspiny field, this field must be filled out.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for vendors): use the offerer to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily need to be the author. if the photograph is working here for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group / Agency will put the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this does not provide protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator, can delete or change the solution for this problem is digital watermark. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and half-professionals, this protection is very important for it.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique for each image. it was in the near future to provide such a module for stacks.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: PLATTENFEHLER, record, blackbreaking, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage, time period, temperature, data size, common superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that can be lost on the street or a fire. these types of losses are the same which can also happen to you with traditional paper pictures or negative things. in this section, we address problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data collection company in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs must be treated in cautious and you can no longer buy CDs and DVDs in the archive quality, which are more difficult to get more difficult and considerably more expensive. there are offers about gold-coated DVDs, £2, which claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves. whether you believe it is in your brass space.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you store good disks and good track record and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable. so it turns into the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if you were just written only. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection, they are needed by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust, etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there are a favorable program called IsoBuster which does appear to do wonders on CDs and DVDs. it is also not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the defective data of damaged diskettes, harddisk, Flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Visual media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the Formatwar against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost sixsmal the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything that has been said to CDs and DVDs also applies to Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slow with a good recording facility on high quality media in a non proprietary format. then read out the media with a description, date & author features, and afterwards on a clean, dark dry and sheltered spot traffic. do not forget to copy the data on the next generation of media before using the latest piece of hardware or software that can read the media.</seg>
<seg id="186">DiskMark retain your statistics for themselves. their manufacturing conflict require a new disk, but not the data. Google poses a large field study on the subject of the error-mechanisms of harddisks: disinfallied</seg>
<seg id="187">Soon: disks remain at the longest if you are operated in the tempering range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. with lower heat removal, SMART this error may not determine. some of the SMART reported error occurred at the immediate forthcoming result. this is especially Lesefehler and Verlagationstechnik. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is just the complete loss account of overstrain. of course, you may also have data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can normally be made back without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices stream do not do much, it looks different in devices with computer chips and high-speed processors. these can cause serious harm. on your computer, these anomalies can cause hardware replacement, destroyed motherboards and other defects. so you protect themselves from the irreverable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against blackheads is an Overvoltage protection. this is a device that a portion of energy heat absorbed and the rest assured. it is usually available in form of a plug-in. however, remember that not every plug-in also contains an Overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you look out for an Overvoltage protection, then you should be sure that he meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a specific minimum of protection. you should also take care of it protects protection against flash envelope and therefore protects the correctly associated devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Because the voltage of each cable can use to your computer, you should be sure that all the peripherals are connected to your system. some manufacturers face an tension-cap when also included a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and television card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will require a portable Overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and are very small and you also contain the protection of the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an Overvoltage protection system protects your system from smaller fluctuations into the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete case. even a drop of a few seconds can lead to loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be sensible in a-breaking power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection from overtension, these devices can automatically collect accumulator when a power drop. this gives you the opportunity to store your data and run the system sorted by the electricity. if you purchase a USV then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements like an Overvoltage protection. moreover, the lifetime of the battery and the underlying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concerns the potential risk that is exposed to your billing system and compare its safety at electricity disorders that cost you up to & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you think about how well your computer is protected by it. finally, you should remember all cables before you go to the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web-Service contains S3-Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service. with the right configuration you can use it as drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup goal for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are compared to the hard disk drives, but very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send data about the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general fuses. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo-Community 23hq.com are available on photos. their free memory is available in full resolution online. the professional version puts you more at your disposal in case of Flickr dramatically more. for 25 $a year you will receive unrestricted memory, which should be checked in reality first.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically calculated thanks to the TCP protocol and with the big companies included in the offer a backup and a distributing memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission belts in calculator. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the filesystem and btrfs put at least the database integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one says when a transfer error occurred, not when this occurred in your hardware. it's quite disturbing that there is no protection to you in your computer. no one seems to have thought of it. no one seems to have thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer file than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable network parts are a further source of transmission belts as they create interference within the data flows. in normal filesystems these errors are unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with turnouts on lower levels and is available among one to the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope it soon also available for Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in the alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms of the fs and is also available for & Linux; but it is not yet part of the core.</seg>
<seg id="208">Underestimate this not! these two factors are for 86% of data loss in the notebook and 46% for the workplace. notebooks is already the share of robbery 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most of these. it results in a lower damage, such as theft or new installation. and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer have been seen.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to collect data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, Reiss, JFS and XFS to name the spread file systems. a very good English articles can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: false, only the speed of the investigating process during a sudden interruption of operation is higher and an indefinately status will be avoided if a file is not completely stored before the problem appeared, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft, and human error is the root causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries. it means that while the technology is further developed, there is a natural frontier for this progress. sensitiveness and space carvings for all types of light sensors are not far away from that border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today cameras go towards the 10 Megapixelsensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and a high quality optics, the optimum size for compactor cameras. even DSLR Cameras have a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive can be achieved today for 100 & euro. so do not make anyone else for data loss in every year. so secure your data often after a plan and test this back before you get some hazardous like the reinstall of your operating system to make the exchange of hard disk drives, or sizes of hard disk drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you daily make your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash suggests you are lucky when the drive is not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster comes locally and destroyed a lot. forget aircraft UFO, fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous for your data. they normally concern an entire room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Hence, Descent does not mean a local storage. bring your backups up the stairway up into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files will be backed up. it is a snapshot without history, and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differing protection: a backup of the files changed since the last complete assurance. generates a complete snapshot at two times: the complete assurance and that of the last discrepancies.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup began. you can restore the original status at any time. this backup comes to a version of version, next with the exception that it is only scrampled and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool you can be easily installed on your machines. unlike script controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer-scripts, rsync only the difference of files that have been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security about ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Make important images directly after you stored them on your computer to DVD or another optic medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This course of course leaves you enough time to discover losses and restore. at the same time, you come back to secure it. at the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least a month and a snapshot every month. each further thinner should be done manually, after which you have done a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: Metadata, in the image file stored IPTC information, Associated XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, relocate images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, reflections,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">Allowing us to survive the next 40 years that is about the timespace in which you truly are interested in your childhood and youth, there are two strategies that you should be observed:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future because of your nature is unpredictable, you must look at everything today. unfortunately, there is no other possibility than a certain vigilance to leave. unfortunately every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system are backward. the less variations you have used in the past, the more easily it's the questions of the future to evaluate.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualisation is now available for everyone. so if you have an old system that reading your pictures is important, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your machine architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should review your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the priority for the possibility to change a system in its greatness. this is actually always growing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's suppose you plan the scalability with them and you want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and shift to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg, whether your new record was detected by the system, but do not hang it on.</seg>
<seg id="235">B / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb, the new record is / dev / sdb / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollars; resize2fs / dev / sad c1 # change the size of reiserfs if needed</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day one software is able to read more, then you can create this yourself. this task is easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format which disappears slowly from the market. you should therefore not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was designed as an open source standard to replace GIF. but it can save much more. it is disable to save XMP, Exinf and IPTC Metadata, 16-bit per colour collaterals and Chromebooks. this format is relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF needed and a slow compression. this format we want to recommend you to storing your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF may be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a veritable compression salary mus (deflate). however, some cameras will be stored in this format. however, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digitale Negative file format is a licence-free and open-format format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. DNG is developed at the TIFF / EP format and is obliged to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers will now be available and we hope that the co-competition Canon and Nikon it will use some time.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; autoensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a characteristic of XML and RDF. the file information will be stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to be an original of your recording, mostly in raw format, to archive. XMP doesn't fit, because it saves the metadata separate from the image file. however, you can think about whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards, which includes a large area of applications and modelling, discussions and community involvement in the DCMI Communities and the DCMI workgroups, annual conferences and workshops, standard communication and educational efforts to reach a virtual acceptance of metadata's standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the cardholder or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera level, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert DVD files to DNG and save it in your resource archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a finalized processing you can use external programs. if you have the pictures again with & digiate; edit, then you should cut the metadata again. these have under certain circumstances be cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright issues with a digital watermark. just export them to MPEG, use in MPEG, use in contact leaves, print, etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera connector is not the only way to get your photos in & digid; in the section Add a photos to an album you can add a description of how you can already add on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatdatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To run your digital camera with & digiera; connect it with the PC, turn the camera onto the display mode and turn them into. a further description of this can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, try to connect with your camera. with some cameras it may appear a little indicator. if this is the case, the filename and a symbol for the file is displayed for each file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you might need to check the camera information about each entry. with the sidecar properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the characteristics of an item or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file features and the photo information that can be stored on the camera internally. a symbol indicates that the picture is not yet available to your computer. please note that some digital cameras will not be available for any information.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab metadata shows the internal metadata like exif, manufacturing, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as with the metadata page left out of the main window of & digikam; or the image processing. keep in mind that these metadata are not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The simplest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection from all. this invites the photos to be deleted and we recommend you check if the images are sure to be downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can select only the selected using standard method of selecting & kde; once you choose the photos, use the button download and then download the selected. the button chosen is long out, until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option new download is available. these pictures have not been downloaded from & digival; once you choose this option, the new images can be downloaded with a star in the window display. if you choose this option, you will only download the new images.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you use the buttons all download or use selected, appears a dialogue with which you can select the target album, shown in which the photos will be sorted, displayed in section My albums. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After watching the target album, press OK, and & digikam, invites the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of this by using the button Delete All. if you just want to delete some, then you have to select it first and use the delete filtering.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there are no possibility to recover from the camera to restore it. you should therefore check carefully if the photos were successful into a & digival; -album were downloaded, before you want to delete it from the camera. if you want to completely delete it from the camera, you should make this above the camera screen, since this is essentially faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filename for the photographs are often not particularly meaningful ones, after the photos are deleted from the camera. this can be useful to add pictures of different capture criteria in the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was taken to integrate into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options on the turning point and mirrors of the picture and for datasheing hypns. if you use this option, automatically a folder per day is created.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transmission opens three more options that are carried out before the photos on the record can be stored on the disk. the first two concern the data about the author in the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all images uploaded.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want another pattern format as standard format, you can use for example in the editing field the prefix photo-% Y-% M-% d% H:% M:% S. place the option date & time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the instruction must be strfintimate.</seg>
<seg id="265">When you use option camera file, you have the possibility to alter the filename in lowercase letters. or in big letters if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digid; for a photo is used, is displayed below the name, which provides the camera in the preview. your settings for renaming will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera system next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digival; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to make use of recording. not all cameras make this information available. in the section sidebar Metadata you can read further details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched, and if your camera does not provide this information, leaves & digil; the photo in its original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the button below and choose the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera was made information about the date where the photo has been made available, can be & digion; this subsection is based on image data. all the images with the same date will be loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras will provide this information. in the section sidebar Meta-data you can read what information your camera could embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off, and in this case stores it, and in this case stores it. if you want to change it, you need to switch this option. use the button Conskyline and select the option dating back to the bottom end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The simplest way to load photos from their computer on their camera is the button download. then select upload. the file selections dialog & kde; appears in which you choose the files that are to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">Once the selection process is done, asks & digil; you where the images will be loaded up. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select the folder and press OK to start the upload. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. it is a position that can be indicated in longitude and latitude and that can be displayed on a map. the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photo graphs it can be interesting to link a picture with an unprecedented geographical place. not everyone uses a plane to caraccount an area by automatic inclusion of GPS data. environmental planners, military, architectural, architectural, and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten occasion where exactly the photo was taken, you can click with a click a browser which shows the area. if you want to post a postcard to another & digival; user may want to locate the place of the photo, it is good the position of the photo information of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data comes into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 contains many GPS datefields such as direction, saddle and card referencing. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly using the right hardware, through a postprocessing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module (manual) and finally about the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receiver. either as a ticket module, or through transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS-Interface: CoyAshleyEye Ipaq Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR rioh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be loaded with gpsman or gpsbabel. you need to store this data in the gpx format, as this is the only format that is supported by the module to the geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract data from images and GPS and correlate it. on the following page you can display the same under & Linux;: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitudinal or other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the hallmark Coordinate coordinates, which are created for instance by maps.google.</seg>

<seg id="294">By default, the image editing a black background behind the indicated photos. if you prefer a different color, you can switch this here. you can switch the toolbar off if you use the toolbar in the full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with darker or light colour in the picture. these colours will be specified here. in the picture editing, this View Mode can be switched with F10 and F11 and turned off.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in color information. please refer to this article in Wikipedia to the nearer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With setting PNG compression you can reduce the size of PNG files. this surgery is not reducing the image quality, because PNG creates a versive algorithm. the only effect is that the image data put more time to execute and pack abs. if you have a quick calculator, you can put this value on a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files compress you can turn the deflate -compression salary mus for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality because the deflate -algorithm is disable.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting-free JPEG-2000 files you can put the lossy-free track. even if you select the lossy-pleaser adjustment, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with the normal JPEG. when this paragraph has not yet been supported, but was still in the planning stage.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the previous versions of & digikam, the picture editing only one picture concerned for photos. currently, it develops very quickly to become a tool for the manipulation of your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default percentage is that all green pixels are the same. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option makes the image a little soft, eliminating however the 2x2 Gitterpatterns with the VNG- or the AHD-quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the whiteboard used the camera will be used. otherwise, if put, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the whitish is not set off. standard is it a fixed color balance, which was photographed on a white map that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps more details in the nickname. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is it the oxidized, so the parts of your images are burned down, due to the inability of your camera to view the top-remixed results, because it shows the setting-up in various roattists. finally, you can try to reconstruct several parts of the missing information from the top-edge technology.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general is not as fast satious as green and red. and dcrab are trying to reconstruct the missing green and red files from the not saturated blue pixel. of course, this is a matter how much paint or whites you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option reconstruct, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminary value to your liking. you probably need to put it slightly higher than standard 1. this can also be made later in the image options of the & digival; image processing will be made. to keep the time for the demosaicing small, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing -algorithm is a digital image process to get a complete picture out of the part-related image sensor that provides lots of cameras and which makes a matrix colourful pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA-Interpolation or Farbrekonstruktion.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digiate; and Dcrab provide you with three alternatives available: Bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD Interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm that was used by Dcrab. but it is the first algorithm that was used by Dcrab. Bilinear is interesting if you're looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can put the red and blue-proof values here. this is certainly the best method for a period of different type, since you will be converted during the resource converge.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translate the Farbinations and gives instructions on how this should be returned. there are also LCMS and & digikam; information like the farbinations of a color tree in the others are so accurately as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behaviour questions, if an image is opened in the editing process / colour module, with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">In the folder folder, fill in the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can store all your profiles. & digival; examine this folder during the starts.</seg>
<seg id="315">Setting of ICC profiles you have here the possibility & quot; default squat; for your profiles to be saved. everything can be changed while opening the pipe-file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color-view view is an alternative towards Xcalib or Argyll. here are just your pictures and manages not the whole screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be used to the camera body and model that you use. not all profiles are created on the same type. there are some, such as Canon, which do not have color tonmapping or flame retardless. currently, dcraw gamma is not required for conversions at 16 bit depths. this means that you have to carry the color tonmapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like this soft-proof profile, with which you can emulate how to print your image from a device. this is very useful before you print your printer, as your printer has a smaller color area as your camera and some colors will therefore be very saturated. this could you manually correct rather than rely on the flashing algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is pretty obvious that color profile is intended for them for what is provided. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here follows a table of cameras and profiling behind them. this answer is of course unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon extension extended the style for the goal: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portraits and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image Plugin Interface. it is an interface, which is supported by a number of & kde; image concerned and imaginations; many modules support that were written to work with any program, which supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules that you want to use, and these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Styling for tasks that can be carried out by modules can be set in the menu under Settlements.</seg>

<seg id="338">The editing tool contains a number of tools to enhance your images. so some of them are available as modules into & digid; therefore, you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules you can find in the section editing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file number, magnifier factor and the current image size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and including the toolbar to provide quick access to the most frequently used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the picture editing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file storing or the button save from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly create a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with file storing as well.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the File Format or use the button 'Restore "Restore in the toolbar, you will then lose any change that you have carried out in the photo since the last time.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of the picture editing may be reversed or recovered. the last action you can turn back, by stopping Beam reverted or restored by choosing the Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should make yourself the shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to turn back and Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to reproduce.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; on the back-back button in the toolbar to press a moment longer, you get a contextmenu. if you select one of the menus, all actions in between also be reversed or recovered.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have launched the editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same point by using the navigation buttons, image high, image runder or the entries in the menu file. if you want to make changes in the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can go in the photograph in the photograph, in which you can use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar, or the entries in the box menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar to choose the enlargement factor automatically.</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. you come into the normal view where you can use the Esc button. usually, you can change this in the introducting dialog by & digikam; change this window from the window. see this section to set up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the image file and get the standard & kde; push dialog. you can adjust the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole phrases. whole images can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the pictures with the default methods and select from the menu album, when you follow the assistant, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digival; main window has a sidebar at the right edge that provides important information and promotions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available, without the navigational games, also available in the image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders are listed:</seg>
<seg id="354">Extra-creek clicking on the same rider leaves the sidebar to appear and disappear into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the description, you can input or insert circumcisions with unlimited size or insert. please note the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. that means that all the special characters are allowed. the circumcisings are copied in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only supports ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are illustrated according to 2000 characters and special features are formed. if you want to use the IPTC protruding field in other applications, you should notice these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After which you have commented, use either the button or simply switch to the next picture, the indictations will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the use-button there is a button More. with this you can write other metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this will always be done if you have selected a metadata setting, which is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section evaluation displays a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and collation. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut. in order to evaluate several images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field urgency. the coding follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keywords, shows a searcher to the filter parameters, the keywords, and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this & digid; -session compatriates keyword.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keywords will be adapted dynamically to the one-given search tool. you can easily restrict the number of ways in finding a keywords. this ability is especially useful if you have a lot of keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another facilitation in entering sampling, in a picture series. if you have typed various keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be placed through marker of the respective crossroads in the tree. all the catchwords of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the top view and select a keyword in the keywords, this will only be applied to the whole selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keywords, please read the keywords filter version.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar keyb filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their album, - Datum-, keywords, and search engines. if in addition one or more keyb filter appears from the right side, only the cutting quantity of these two is displayed. all keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop. suppose you have selected in the main view several images to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and attach to the selection. as a result, a dialog, which you asks if you want to put the keywords.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the top example shows the main window frames displayed on a calender date. the keywords will be selected, with Ctrl + a, and after that a keyword was drawn from the right keytree to the selection and pictured there. a dialogue asks if this keywords shall be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at any start of the program. you can also be switched under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or its needs, you can easily change it with a double-click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry to be sought after in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string, which is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set up a Advanced search of all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">When you want to group options, you only need the cable field at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options see then as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? the free space site is there for 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in the full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly worked on & digikam; s concrete implementation was adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow using the colours available from your camera or scanner, you can easily get photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor those from your camera or scanner, and that the colors you print or purchased in the web which suit you from your digital dark room.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the topic is coming in color administration, everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, the meaning of this tutorials is to provide you with adequate background information about colour management. additionally, you will find links with deeper information allowing your own informal decisions to make you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your workflow meets all the criteria listed below, you do not have to worry about color administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor based on the RGB mode type. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other images include by email or the web, where sRGB of the de-facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So when sRGB does so well and life for all so easy, why should one use another color tree and thus to worry about color-wrinkles?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB comparing to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all the colours we can see, the hugely-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB color tree, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensioning representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, then visit Bruce Lindbloom excellente site and then click on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to display my monitor if I decided to work only in the RGB colour foam?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the RGB colour or not, you need to display your monitor, since RGB does not include your monitor player on sRGB mode. if you are working as in the color tree of sRGB, you need to either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool exposes five automatic corrections that can improve an image in most cases. use it before you try further reducing manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, alternate, automatic and contrast from the menu of corrected automatic correction automatically try to make the best. you will need to experiment with these effects, to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the luminaire-rise above the entire picture, so that the dark point black and the lightest point will change as bright as possible without its gradations to change. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Absame: this method adjusted the lightest method of the colors of the selected picture, so that the histograms of the intensity is as flat as possible. sometimes it achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produced just rubbish. it is a very powerful surgery which causes either wonders in an image or it destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic cleaning: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue-channel. it controls the dark and bright border-tones and adjusted the red, green and blue-channels on the whole histogrammes area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Double-contrast: this method improves the contrast and light of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible area and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible in mature images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The whitish of & digions; is a semi-automatic tool in order to perform the white marmotions of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white straight-correction is somewhat limited since about a color tree with 8-bit per colour. if you can practice it too far from the original image. if you can perform the white straight in the gray mode, which in the 16-bit mode works, so your possibilities will be considered better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white archipelago of the copyrighted by Pawel T. Zyym. you start it via the menu bar color white straight from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The window display can be adjusted in size. on the left side are both the original image and the preview of the target picture. the preview is adapted dynamically to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white straight away, then it dates back to the window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target picture features a red marker. the Luminanz of the Pixels under this marker is displayed as verbal line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right upstairs is a histograms appears that as soon as you change a parameter. this histograms is very helpful, even in well illuminated images, most pixels very small Luminous values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminanz.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your outcome depends on shadows, satiation and gamma-gging. the shadow of adjusting lets you improve the shadow side of your photos or dimming.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above mentioned checks should be applied, you should use the color temperature piston. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color temperature of the white colour. this way the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white-off with the list of preference. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposed indicators increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixels is overexposed. it will display the combined result in the white cover. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons as well as loading make exactly this. any setting of the white comparison you can set can save it into a text file and then load later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button presets set all the filter values once again on its default values and the corresponding neutrality rate. keep in mind that the appropriate settings may be added to another photo than your original. if you save it, your original image will be modified.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the coding element per color-channel of the bewritten image. 8-bit coding is the widely spread JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high quality pictures. these encoding is also needed for high-quality coding time and stands out to the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue as for the processing of blanks. it uses the change and the allocation of paint profiles. colours can be carried out by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailled manual for the use of color profiles, you can draw the chapter Colimalt at rate.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another key tool is available in the menu below colors. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust to multiple color channels, so that you can always use it for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always take the same mistakes and you can therefore always find the same correction. in the handbook, you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">To rectify a very powerful possibility of assimilation problems is the tool that you'll find in the colors of Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digifted effect provides four color effects, a solar power calculates, a cycle effect, a neon effect and a chuder filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical manufacturing, solar panels, also called Sabatier, an effect of the image evolved. the colored, darker areas protected the delicate areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting result. the result was a part negative of the picture. this tool permits you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controlled the solar energy. at about 50% intensity the image is what chemically possible is. an additional increase finally generates a negative image that so does not produce on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar power. the original one is the (1) and the one the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid-filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a satiation that he does a stronger contrasting effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the flagship produced by the Japanese company FUJIFILM. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for his smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated color during daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics they make him the film of choice for nature fotographs. Velvia is strong complex colors, but also some photographs, specifically those who are barely insure, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the fever reps the strength of the neon. at large pictures the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the color shades and the lightest of the photos. you can preview the various colour basins of your photos with the tools in the menu below colors. once you are happy with the result you use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo with bad light conditions, you can easily get the reverse problem: one too big satiation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation may simply reduce it. all changes you can perform in preview. if Him like the result, you can confirm the changes made with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Among the complex tool Gradation and the simple Leuchstrength / contrast / Gamma is the tool tone correction to improve the exposure. even if the dialog is too complicated for this tool, you need only the area of slider. concrete the three slider below the histogramms.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window provides a graphs of the Intensity values, a histograms, of active canals or of the selected area. under the graphs are three sliders to change in, and the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The simplest way to learn how to use is to move the controller and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right can be seen the original and preview of the picture. the preview is dynamic, updated with the settings of the image, updated. on the left hand side are the following options available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be adjusted if the histograms is shown with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. in pictures the large areas of a constant color includes the linear histograms of a single pillar is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logical story of a single column is beneficial.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three shelves: the uppermost for the dark Tones, the middle for the light tones and the lower for the middle tones, often called gamble-values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color-pinets can be used in the original image of the original image, to adjust the inputs of the shade, middle and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is a knob for a fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: allow the output values allowing the selection of manual values for each field. there are also two Regler that can be used to change the output levels as with the input values, for example, to create a hidden image as a background to see while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and store: with these buttons, the missing values can be stored in the filesystem and later reloaded. this will be used on Gimp levels.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three shades, the input-readings will be automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sunshades. tick the color image which you want to use and click on the original image of the histogramms for rotation, green, blue and the Luminanzchannels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overexposed indictator controls all shades and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the alignment of the input levels applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected picture (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half the original is displayed and the target picture is displayed dynamically depending on your settings. on the right hand side are the following options available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifications: this selection box allows the channel to specify the channel changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Besides this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures that have been included with a digital camera. for pictures with large areas of a constant color, linear mode creates a broad panel. in this case, the logarithmic mode will continue.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you move e.g. a student rope to the right, for example, the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds with a darker outfors corresponding and that the associated image are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">The preview of its original photos is to see a red marker. if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change, a suitable line on the curve is displayed, which represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it down and down, down to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: these buttons can make you exactly this. each bend that you may have generated can be saved in the filesystem and later be loaded. the file format is the Gimp Kurdish format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you are using this method and the three shades of the curve are automatically created the control points of the curve for all channels of the barrier, middle and solar tones. activate the color-pette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and Luminanzkurve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overexposed indictator controls all color channels to display over-coated pixel. if in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-white photo, which was corrected in Luminanzkanal. shadow and sun-sounds was set with the color pette and applied to the curves. the original one is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel-Mixer of the & digidyer; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color gradations of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel-Mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images. you can edit it from the menu colours channel mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the Kanaloptionally, you can select the color for the Histogram: this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed as compared to the own riders.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the image, a vertical line in the histogram is shown to show you the appropriate colour.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: regulator for red, green and construction will enable you to mix these channels. if you can also enable the appropriate dose components, as the channel mixer will then DAS to the creation of great black-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-white portrait.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix monochrome, which comes the reduction of color to a visible towel that comes from fares. Farbrewers consists of small spacing facts. if that is the case, you can improve your Monochrome conversion to improve in which you first reduce the color scheme.</seg>
<seg id="447">The saliva as and loading buttons are used exactly to this for purposes. any Mixer attitude allows you to save it later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp-portrait format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overexposed indictator controls all shades and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been recompelled. the option Luminanz is activated. the original image is under (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of the digital photographs, black / white is a working step, because shades can be easily converted to the machine. also with a set of film profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford PanP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulated a black / white filament with a green linsenfilter. this looks good, with all the scenarios and fits particularly well with portraits against the sky. thus, much like the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangeilter: simulated a black / white filament with a orange linsenfilter. this increases landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. so much like the 002 Cokin (tm) Orangeilter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilter: simulated a black / white filtering version with a red linsenfilter. this creates dramatic art effects and can simulate lunchtime reaction to the time period. so much like the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulated a black / white filename with a yellow linsenfilter. this is the most natural color tonperseverance and enhances the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) Gelbfilter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm bright and medium tones. this is very similar to the process of running a printing and the re-development in a Sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digival; tool texture, you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, whether it is a color picture or not, you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas, the pinch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or just like a wall picture on a wall. the sample variations in the image processing can be used for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: to move this parameter to the right raises the emblance of depth and dodimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text defect has been applied to the photo below. the original image is (1) and that changed under (2). the parameter Relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digian; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keep the eye of a beholder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. a possibility to keep his attention is to put the image to a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the stream eye. under picture frame it can be started from the editing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the cart type for your image. thoroughly close the picture with a colored line, Niepce shifted it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-white images), seduet it with a nice three-dimensional frame is ideal for a button-effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with designs.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: returns the width of the frame in percent. the value area for the width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The picture set with the frame is bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio is. this is important for the pressure of the images, especially if you have used the tool to cut beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert single formatted text into an image of any one place. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to user. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text guide, orientation, color out of the color tree and character set with its features like you. you will simply select a frame round the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting that you chose for your text can be changed until you press button OK. once the image is stored once, the text part of the picture. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digian; tool to apply a template that you put an impression on an image.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "the" "" "picture 1" "" "menu of the image processing can be used in order to put an image." ""</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG transparent format. if you want to add your template (9) to the reduction in the file size. if you want to add your 1 e-mail to the & digiftist; mailinglist digil-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to put your stencil folder with the button base folder. select the folder in which you have copied the stencil files. these settings are marked for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">Having set the root folder for the Stencils, appears a belly-view that reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder, and the selection of a folder is updated the presspar of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below you can find three buttons with which you can change the magnifier factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob-stocked the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse knob.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this knob smaller the underlying picture. it is centered to the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the entire picture, you must decrease the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse knob.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move this button to move the below to the template. take the picture and place it at the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template into your image. the image will then be adapted automatically to preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; makes three different tools available for grinding. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for shooting. it is very fast and simple, but created especially in dark areas, grained pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unpness mask is working on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharpened. in fact, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to atmospheric Dunst and it's doing here a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and it's copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refecussies may possibly be the best of three as it really enhances the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised images require correction of sharpness. this is the smaller one that is smaller than the dissolution will therefore be somewhat blurred. the same phenomenon can observe if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more detox sharpening as normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">With JPEG-images it is often applied to a camera internal tubing. images in raw format, on the contrary, must always be pened during treatment.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a pair of scary already during the reading of the image. if you activate this deactivate, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by boosting a photo with the sharpening defenders. you can call you with the sample-in error corrected.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should hereby bapy with caution because the outcomes are not very natural - the sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also boosts the noise. in general, the viable technique for correcting chorages. you can reach it about the sample in the chorage of chorages. under Refecussian image you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for shooting.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: an image is too crunchy. the solution to record the picture a little soft, is much easier than it sharper. use the tool to get softening with the menu item, and experiment with something with settings. the occurrence of window on the right side of the dialogue will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help you edit the image. window display shows the output of the filtering with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values produce frequently good results and should first try out. an increase in the radius or the amount reinforcing the effect. if you can make the sharpness mask, get caught and produce the impression of grats within close proximity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius displays a how many pixels are affected by the filter by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radios. you should therefore raise pictures of the best in its final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurned picture which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The Corpora wert is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable differential amount. in this way, areas will be applied to a soft change between the killing of sharpening and hence flaw in faces, celestial and aquatic surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of unsharp filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image is (2). blurred has been used with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a sellchecker = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiver; tool refussionging refussionates a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted unprotected film algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries on an image to & quot; refokussian quot; in which it makes the defensive work reversible. it makes use of a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. the traditional technique for the shooting of images is the use of a sharpness mask. you can start it from the menu by calling the reflexicon in picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular wraps works much better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche Faltung has a very long tail, which leads to the FIR Wiener Inverse the Gauß'schen Faltung is even influenced in most cases even very strongly from the remote pixels. it causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpening: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the key parameters for the use of this module. for most pictures the default value should result in 1 good results. you can put a higher value when your image is very blurred, but then at Heiligenscheine.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in the correlation can help decrease artifacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close 1, & eg; 0.95 and upwards. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpending effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Smokshfilter: an increase in the catchfilter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 only rarely. if the spacesfilter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poor. a consumer value is 0.03. a high value gets the image more polluted.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß'sche Schärfe: this is the radius causes the Gauß'sche Schärfe. this parameter is most commonly caused by a previously unpredness filter. in most cases, you should avoid this value on 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value unequal zero, so you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the hedge filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrixes: this value determines the size of the transformationsmatrix. increasing the die size can produce good results especially if you choose big values for the circular sharpening or Gauß'schen sharpness. however, that the module is very slow if you choose great value for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The saliva as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any chorages parameters that you have set is thus saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the cutting, color and voicing activities on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image before you change the image. the reason for this is that many operations changes not immediately visible are not immediately visible, but left intact artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you browse photos and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, blurred mask provides better results as a sharpening. this could be caused by blurred masks a bigger neighborhood used as a sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, it must be blurred, always remove artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the intolerance. for the Vienna filter one can show that there is the optimal ruler of the filtering effect. the FIR Wiener Filter is almost just as good as the intolerance. the FIR Wiener Filter is frequently better in treating small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters on a small unfocussed image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture has to be corrected. this picture was made with a analoon camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto-focus Linse attributable.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of raising correction, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The Regler Glätte continues the blurredness of the area of the dark dark and thereby generate a natural pinch.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color-tinte allows a adapted color for the Pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools in order to remove the requested artifacts with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The incorporating algorithm was developed by IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to create the filtering orders you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed stopover [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an equiliary about the image. Wounded bigger values mainly homogeneous regions gluten and details is unsharp. please note that no sharpening should be detained or requested. please note that the addiction always should be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Approximation addiction alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothed evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film clip or CCD spacing will produce a high level wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best at a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this puts the maximum smoothing factor above all else. then, then, the relative glatification. place this value accordingly to the level of smoking in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set. this is necessary, when a lot of noise is predominant, since it is difficult to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect he must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: returns how often the algorithm is continuously going through. usually there is 1 or 2 out.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular wide da [5, 90]: Angled integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is small, it should also be small in order to generate a long running time. so you should select this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral Strange [0,1, 10]: integrative start-up in pixels. you should put the value smaller 1 to avoid Sub-Pixel smoothing and never bigger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the More about quality that you receive by selection of this option is only small. however, it doubles its duration. we therefore recommend it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons as and loading make exactly this. any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and later be loaded back again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correct error correct is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still take a long time and a high CPU load to pull out. you can therefore cancel calculation at any time with the knockoff.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how graphical errors have been corrected with small artefacts. the module will be made on a photo that is made in Guatemala City with an analogen camera, applied. as you can see there's a peculiar artefact in the foreground, that is caused by a bad film storage during the trip. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digifted; lowerreduction is a very powerful tool to decrease images. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool exposes selectable image filter to remove spots and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensory from the camera or moireacute; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on sensory of digital cameras, so you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene which has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granary room that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings may remain in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel and can modify the image. the area moving through the image and the color in it will be smounted and therefore minor errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the pixelfepegel. this value exposes the pixelam filter to look lighten. if you are raised the edges of the filter, if you change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter images can no longer be obtained and smoking, or lubricate occurs once more.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the chimprecision for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response to the filter. if it is too severe not the entire noise can be removed or roughees can occur. put it on a value close to the maximum, if you want to remove a faint or JPEG-artifacts without details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Lighdensity: controls the luminance intolerance of the image. we recommend you either color or luminance to change an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color-tolerances of the image. we recommend you either change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process of the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatolance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance of the darker areas, which are typically more bolted, to increase. however, it is also the shadow ranges.</seg>
<seg id="541">Absorption: controls the alignment of the Phasenvoy. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius is reacted. if it is increasing, the edges may occur. if it is too high, noise and phemenjitter can occur in the edges. it can remove tips and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for the lorescission reduction you have set, can be saved to the filesystem and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how the reduction of your life may change. the original one is with (1) and the corrected with (2). the reduction has been applied to the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes an image is naked for your purpose. the solution to record the picture is a little soft, fortunately many simpler than one image to defuse. use to add a tool to the softsignia with the sample entry, and experiment with the bulb. the window display on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digidyed; photo Restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to decrease photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter to Restauration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to emerge around Gauß 'stag, film liquors, scratches, compression mode and local mistakes that arise in digital, original or later digitised photographs, and thus gets the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and text-composition. the text setting is performed with another tool, the photo error corrected, performed. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG type: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a versive compression circuit, he creates some compression & quot; Artemaktequot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed image. this setting should be correct.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons as and loading make exactly this. every setting of photo Restoration can be saved into a text file and will be loaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo Restoration is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load to move after. you can therefore cancel calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with like-off smokes,.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a mini camera (tm) HP-5 movie with a Sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous film baskets in the faces. the original one is under (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures has been reduced to an old color foto, which was used with a scanner. you can see the scan species displayed by the scanners and the photo paper. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digival; tool alternate allows sound of photos that have been using a CCD camera to remove. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are particularly in high-quality raw-mode photos a problem because many cameras with JPEG compression over a built-in oppression of hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; name pixquot; and "quot; bright pixquot; to remove a photo with a dark-image submethod method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file into the wizard. the tool will detect automatic the hot and bright pixels. these are accentuated in the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you can start the dark picture directly at the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in previous section, you should load the matching dark picture to the corrective image. please note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and this automatically load it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview will help you to correct the outcome. the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings. poor pixels have taken up in all educational areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpoll this pixblocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duran: it will select an average of the neighbourhoods. the resulting color is assigned to all broken pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interval, this will be made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels pick a distance from 1 of the pixelpack, are being drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear curves (2-DIM) or a group of linear curves (1-DIM). these are then used to cross the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default method method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less of the pixelbase are set out to calculate a bi-square surface (2-DIM) or a group of square curves (1-DIM), which is then used to cross the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cuban: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be pulled to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-DIM) or a group of cubic curves (1-DIM) that is then used to interpolish the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotline correction on a color photo, of a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, which can be seen. the original image was increased to 300% (1) and the corrected image is under (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digival; Vignettierorrektion is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. sublified corners, an image to correct.</seg>
<seg id="567">Expansive lenses, especially the medium and large photo-format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) it reaches the corners and edges of the image by bringing the light to the sensor there. Telelenses show that may also act like this.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has drawbacks. many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 by the aperture filter, which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. craving objective, even with center filter, an opening up of f / 16 or less, as otherwise invective effects emerge through motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure of today's filtration and color, or grey studs of digital cameras and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a centerfilter that is made without this filter, which is applied without a centerfilter on a picture. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three shelves you can control the vigilisation process and with three further the exposing of the target balance.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: these parameters controlled the degree of light absorption on the point of the largest density that Filters. the standard density is 2,0, resulting in an optical filter with a blending radius of 1, or by chance of a light intensity of 2, entrupt.enhance the density to compensate for a larger degree of vignetting, reduce it to a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Lights, contrasts and gamma-settings: the fertilization of an image with the vignetting of the pixels. you have to relocate the exposure of the target image with these options. the regulator will only provide you with positive values because you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine new justment of the target balance, let the values for illuminants / doubast / Gamma at zero and use the Gradation from the & digikam; image processing from the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting process to an image applied. the original picture (1) shows the labels in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a lamp modelling and contrast-correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digid; Linsendistortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colorfully distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second Grades treated the general geometric distortion of the lens, and can correct the concave or concreatic form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third Grades has a similar run effect, but flacht to the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth Grades corrected the distant Corners and set it to the second cades. if you combine these two can combine any geometric distortion nearly eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">Broadly: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second Grades. with negative values they can be corrected or negative values and conscientious objection.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth Grades. this value works more strongly in the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Little parameters has the reverse sign of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scale the image size new and thus leads to a correction of the first Grades through. negative values enlarge while positive the image decreased.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value justiert the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrated the dialogue with a preview the distorisation process. the values that you use for your image will be stored and used at the next start as default.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnell- or vertically correction should be done before all supplies or Sizes. best to cut this correction than all first through. if you make a picture new to cut and then make a tonnellar correction, the effect would be obvious to fallow.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction to you, this tool displays a vertical and horizontal aid line. move it to an important place, like example of the sea side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can fix the tonn- / kridors distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a kite-shaped distortion, the resulting picture black nooks. you can transform them with the cutting instrument in the menu, cutting from the image processing or on the Zoom rule of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures, the tons-like correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motives, e.g. photographs from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture is 90 degrees. please note that if you hold the camera with your hand, you will always have an easy distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of tons-like correction to a church in Norway. the original one is under (1) and the corrected picture under (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infra-film web site which is accessible by the URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfra film, see this URL. this film has a sensation range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can move the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters, set-grain and film sensitiveness (ISO). activate the optional texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO-regulator changes the amount of the film baskets and dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the conversion. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter color channels to reproduce infrared-film, especially the Grünkanal makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the color-formations are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infrared-filmeektes applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top-light.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digid; filter film baskets is an easy to use tool to reproduce film baskets in your paintings. it is known from classical high-speed movies as for example the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known for sensitivity of the movies, the manufacturers of large silver granders of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-bracing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move into the past. it gets a timeless atmosphere released from day-to-day life. if you want this special, Gallery-like, rhinocgraphic, grained sight especially in your monochromen photos, so you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO-sensitivity can be adjusted to the control of the intensity and degree of granularity. the default value is, although often higher values need to be adjusted to ISO-2400. if you need any more grains, so you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of a film effect on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the edited the (2). the used film-sensitivity meets ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digifted; filter oil paintings generates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digifted; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. natural paintings and breastlife are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two shelves to influence this effect. the upper ones chooses the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smoothes controls the bulls or, from the other side, the articulness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil paintings effect. the original one is with the (1) and the edited is marked with the (2). paper size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digival; filter coal drawing is used to create a coherent degree. the lines that change the surround in the drawing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sketching you. these would be good pictures to begin with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two shelves with a value-range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator chooses the foundation size and the lower justiert the contrast (slip).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the cart-clearer filter. the original image (1) and the altered image (2). the default set of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adapting the Intensity Array.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digikam; filter engraving your image in 3-D as if it was stolen in wax. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digival; filter engraving is a fast tool to re-give your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in its content. the filter makes use of the differences between color and intensity, in order to transform the image into a grey, monopoly landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows it to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, is equivalent to 10%, is the default.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filtergroup you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distorism. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave-blocks 1: shares the image in the cells and makes it look, as if it is seen by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Waveblocks 2: analogue to the shaft-blocks 1 is distorted the image here in a different version of glassbeads.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filtering option you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of dissharpness effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Untoughness: blurred the image along a globular lines which can be of a central point. this simulates the harpness a zooming image and thus generates a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radiale insharpness: blurring the image by rotation of the pixels for a centre. this simulates the dissharpness of a revolving camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Remove-blings: don't wired the picture to generate the effect of a not focused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement-blings: blurring the image through horizontal motion of pixels. this simulates the blurredness of one linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softens Unpness: blurred the image soft to the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates pictures with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or to add a warm and subtle bulb.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shear-blings: blurring the image through random shift of pixels and simulates the blurredness of one of the arbitrary camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent insharpness: finds the coloured basins in the image and blurred it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangle cells and then creates it, through the colt with an average score, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The rain drops are a cute little tool to make rain drops in your image. this gives it natural your pictures a noure appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn urrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drips. as the dripping size is not automatically growing with the size of the image. number changes the number and the density of drops. fish changes the optical effect of drops in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can stick with the & digival; image editing an area free of rain drops. just use the tool to choose the area, e.g. a face, which is to stay for free. if you then start the filter by regentrop, the area will remain free from rain drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the drop-drop filter. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the standard-values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can get it through mirrors or rotating into the right orientation. the tools to be found in the menu transform and transform mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo blowing is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo to enlarge with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to smaller size is simple. the big question is how can you get an image blistered the details? how can you find the missing information back or guessed? the CImg algorithm is used here, makes it a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can change it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size in the menu and enter the destination. the dialog is visible below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to change size uses a linear Interpolation method to counter the pixels. if you want to enlarge a little picture with better quality, then try the tool to inflatable.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge an image. & digifted; used a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm composition was developed by IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to say the tool like you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">One-of-aspect ratio is: if this setting is enabled, the new size of the original size will be the original aspect of the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set. this is necessary, when a lot of noise is predominant, since it is difficult to create a 'van Gogh's Turbulence effect he has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons as and loading are used exactly to be used. each filing for photo enlarge can be saved as a text file and can be loaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflatable is very fast with what it makes, but it can still be very long and a high CPU load to pull out. you can abort the calculation at any time using the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of picture inflatable, by widening a small color picture of the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the Preview (2) is the result of linear standard enlarging the comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a common surgery but also a commonly underestimated tool to compile an image. the picture editing allows this very easy. to make a photo with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and draw the rectangle to generate. you will see this rectangle then you'll see the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you let the mouse go back again the area of the photo will cut off the way off. you can change the size of the subject area by drawing on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle helps you by simply drag it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are happy with the dissection, use the button-button-button of the image processing in the toolbar, and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file saving or file storing under the file to save the newly cropped photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the educational area, you can change the size of the rectangle by putting the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio, which you have defined in dialogue will remain intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">Set in the tool following aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as a high format or cross-format. in the high format, the larger value of the height and the Queryformat will always be assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool helps cut a relative side ratio. that means it always is equal to whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue, two buttons are existing around the selection automatically horizontally or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog you can set with the Max. relationship to the area for cutting on the greatest possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation, set.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool to cut off-ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the trimmer tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation. the modified image measurements are reflected in the EXIF data, so that the EXIF data stored the cropped image and does not reflect the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the compelling aid enable assistance to help you put your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. as the third telegs, harmonic triangles are a rectangle in a similarly harmonious triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division for a variety of natural growth times, such as the spiral of a Nautilus Muschel or the Blüttenblätter of a sunflower. it emerges in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The Golden partition is the irrationale number 1,618033988... and it was used already by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used to give your temples and pyramids. artists and architects made the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; off, where every number after 1 is equal to the sum of its two previous figures. one composition that this rule is followed as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center will be liquid-lines available when you put an image. these aid are enlisted below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The golden spiral will bring you close to your target good results for your photos. compared to the third-party screen, the golden spiral generates a smooth line of the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the view of the observer along the line of the spiral and creates a balanced visual river on this type.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also known, to create the golden spiral. it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this something can simply be there without the eye, it will fulfil its function.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles is also guided by the above golden spiral. your vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden triangles. please note that contrary to the harmonic triangles, Golden triangles are no equals triangles. diagonale to place these lines can be released a static object dynamical.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to finish your frame. try to put your photo focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the trangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can not achieve any otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontally reflected and Vertical are being used to mirror the harmonious submissions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color, you can put the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with lots of colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to turn a picture to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it's easy to keep the camera exactly vertically or horizontal. this creates a picture in which the things turned around a angle. you can fix this with the & digival; image processing and tool free rotation. simply select free rotation, and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. with the button presets you can put the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right top.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module free rotation of horizontal and vertical line is available. move the mouse-cursor to position the two lines, you can set it up with a pressure on the left mouse button. right now, you adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have filmed a picture you will find unwanted three holes in the corners. a way to fix it is the function transform cutting from the editing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to crop the image is the function key cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing smoothes the image a bit after the filming. but keep in mind the same warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All current transformations are carried out by a fixture on the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you must use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically calculated. on the right of the dialogue you will find some information which help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle on the top: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transform area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle Top: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle on the right bottom: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the picture gets a little polluted. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adaptations produce a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After which you adapted the perspective, you get unmistakable triangular holes in the corners. a way to bersome it is the image to cut out of the editing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool system is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part to the opposite. a horizontal tail, i.e. the image is distorted just. in other words, a rectangle becomes transformed into a parallelogram. you can transform this module through transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Move your picture by using the Horizontal angle and the vertical angle. you can press horizontal and vertical at the same time. if you put on preference. a preview of effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target picture are displayed on the right of the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="680">With your help becomes a vertical and horizontal straight line. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse knob to fix the lines. you can now use the tool system to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have performed the embarrassment, the picture gets a bit 'wisely. for a single shift, this effect is usually negligible, but two markers are created twice as much crucient and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shear the image has unbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. a way to eliminate it is the image to cut down from picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digifted; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compised. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digiate;</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization offers tools at its disposal to be used geographically in the spherical coordinates, which is used by GPS and Galileo, localize. height, longitude and latitudinal-grey are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in gpx-file format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Korrelator. this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate to the main window and call the menu on. the above mentioned dialog box then. to load a track file with GPX file, you need to load a trace file with GPX file, which of course, included in the same places as images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file loaded a automatic correlation performed which shows the coordinates in red. GPS Track data are recorded in GMT-time, and therefore the camera should be calculated with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone. place your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camerce. lies the variance among them the data are gathered together. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have a track record of a place for pictures you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the pictures. the time difference from 2000 seconds will then correlate all the images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and differential in min. can be used if you don't have the right data. if you know that in reality an locating difference between camera and GPS is, you can set this limits and then press the button correlate to the interpolish.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set with this dialog. this is useful when you have a number of photos on the same place. as the dialog use the coordinates from a call to the next notice you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The locating can also be found and set-up with the indicated area and enlarge. select this always through until you have achieved a sufficient accuracy. the map can always be selected manually. the map can be switched between card mode, satellite images and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to hang GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that the exagtool used to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module photo gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the string will add UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings may be adjusted. the rider is allowed to select all albums only. the albums are not hierarchically displayed, with the three buttons on the right you will quickly see a large number of albums. in the field below, the AlbenchShow and the text of the page will appear in the header of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each side. the rider is largely asserting itself. if you click on a picture, a new page will be displayed in which the picture is displayed. otherwise, the picture will be displayed directly with your default, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your associated images. select a folder of which you have to write. a subfolder containing the name of KIPIHTMLExport, which everything contains, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF data gets stored in the new images as well.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can set the standard color depth, which naturally also influences the file size. all other settings are explained by yourself.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider thumbnails will give you some of the settings from the album tab for the nail pictures that are small images that are shown in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window indicates the user as far the action is. press copies to break down the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has created the pages, the window will not automatically be closed. you can therefore view the program messages to determine if error occurred during the generation. your web browser will start automatically in the end to preview the gallery. press closing around the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture concerned is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool in order to look at pictures.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture consider it to view a selection of pictures and run on them base operations such as screenings, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short explanations and moist. it was developed for a quick image display and fast access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start a picture is displayed by default in the full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG adaptable module is a tool to change images without interfere with your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows for the current promotions to save images in the JPEG format, without saving the usual losses in quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the lossy-free storage is it that will increase the file size because no compression of the farbinations is taking place. this can be found e.g. in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing it, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-Imaging @ kde.org. attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>

<seg id="840">With the import -function of metadata module you can copy data from one image to another. then select the drop-down dialog with which you can select the file image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata format. the data will be copied to which you have pressed it to the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work in all kinds of image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not into any destination. JPEG is supported on writing. please check out exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in form of a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="843">The module MPEG Kodierer can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, using a defined length, convert the package MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the single images you can insert a basic screen output. you can also add a audio file at the MP2 or WAV of the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are scaled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slideshow. with this module, you can create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images that are packed into the MPEG of Diashau. after that, you can create the extras MMPEG Diashau and start the module.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you selected are then included in the image files. there you can also change sorting of images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">Once you are happy with your list, you should adapt the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to select the file on a TV set, you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL, Secam or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that will indicate a picture. a low value will be created very sudden, a high contrast very flat screen change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt you should leave it black. the name and the path of the created file allows you to define under the name of MPEG-output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify a audio file under name of audio source file, then this will be integrated into the film. depending on the speed of your bills, you can get a coffee with the button. depending on the speed of your bills you can get a cup of coffee and enjoy the slideshow you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that Kodierer or Tools will be missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the button settings right down.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printing assistant allows multiple images on a sheet paper together in standard photographies. the combined images can also automatically be opened using the image editing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve you or print with the Gimp module to direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import and convert your data to one of three formats in one of three formats, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-tool dcrab from Dave Coffin. an original quotation of Him is: expect the same results as the software from your camera body. sometimes you get with dcrab better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file that is to be converted and start the module. the Raw image converter window appears then in mode for a single picture. with the button preview, you can view the effect of your current settings at the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now readjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option will decide whether the camera set to be used for the white prints. the key parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colors RGBG conversion can be chosen for you to use the contracted information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switches has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and keep the conversion output. the filename remains equal and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a veritable algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the lossy-free laser compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you prefer to edit your pictures frequently or do it later, you should not choose the JPEG format, since it is only a limited number of operations allowing the image quality worsening. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that contain in the raw file are stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">When you adjust your settings you can start with the execute button. if you want to cancel this process, you can use the Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">The forklift mode allows you to convert various images at once. use this mode for sure if you are sure, e.g. by testing in a single picture, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, you have the possibility to resign the file automatically. however, this is helpful if it is produced in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. however, the progress report is progressed as far the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it used the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following picture formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to renaming all images of a albums. you can set the prefix, the starting figures and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it used the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can smaller or enlarge the image. these are provided four types of images:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size in a dimension. the width or height of the image will be automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, selected. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to customize your image to screen.</seg>
<seg id="870">Disproportional: disproportionate size in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed when this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepare the image for the photo printing. the user can set the print resolution and the size of the photopapiers. the target picture, including background size, edge-size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>

<seg id="874">You can also drag illustrations on the Picture list and add them to the list of images to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button photographs, the selected images will be removed from the list of extracting images.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all the pictures you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e-mail client. you only need to add the addresses and the header pages. the pictures selected are attached to you as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not pay attention to many pictures at one time. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of emails. it's possibly a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The email windows will be used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and every time you use it again until you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, so you must specify in the input field, including the correct path to your installation.</seg>

<seg id="881">After the selection of comments to a recorded file, the comments on the pictures will be put together into a text file and attached to the email.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photodfiles, but it is best adapted among the lossy formulas like e.g. TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG among images file format and are the original files in the JPEG format, then the original ecifdata are added to the results.</seg>
<seg id="884">If the process is ready, the window will not automatically be closed so you can look at the status bar searching for errors. however, your E-mail program is automatically started at the end. with the button. you can send this window gly? en.</seg>
<seg id="885">After the starting of the module Fortgeschrittene Diashau, a window will appear with questions like you have shown your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL-transitions in the presentation activates very elegant image transfers using OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphics card, since otherwise the slideshow is very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option filename makes sure that the filename of the images in the left corner is displayed during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop. you can then manually pull together with Esc; abort.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly choose that the images are displayed in a random order. therefore, it is not used the order of the images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Taking delay between the images can be set the timeless distance between the individual images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect. you should be interftly before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are over a dozen transition-out effects among which you can choose. by chance, choosing a different effect in every transition between pictures.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left side of the screen. move your mouse into this corner to turn off.</seg>

<seg id="894">In the left side of the screen, you can view the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date justifying currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing it, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-Imaging @ kde.org. attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background is a tool to set a picture as a background picture for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module consists of the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the menu, as the backdrop for your KDE workspace.</seg>

<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, places and other settings, you can view with thumbnails to look at the pictures of your car range.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol before their name. you can store with & kphotoalbum. however, for each person they can store their own picture-picture, this also applies to places, keywords, and other categories that you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the name you choose the button that you choose from the right outside on the toolbar. please note that you can choose the view for each category separately. that's the advantage that you can see for example symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords. (if you have no suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must define yourself what image is displayed for each individual person. in order to view this, you have to view the image editor's text (in more detail), then select the image for the appropriate person. in the view window, you can adjust the enlarging factor according to your wishes and selecting which part of the picture is displayed and can be cut or edited.</seg>

<seg id="907">If you enter a character string into the box or description, the circumcisings and descriptions of images are searching for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for example, for example 1971, or the entire date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window you can browse all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Isper, but not Anne Helene are pictured.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum. if you do not want to read handbooks, but rather try to try different functions, you have the following alternatives to this guide:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the home page of & kphotoalbum; and look at the quick-up, the screen photos and the introductions.</seg>
<seg id="911">Launch & kphotoalbum; and select in the first dialogue the demo, in case you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select in the menu help menu navigation album; -demo. then, some examples are loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the home page of & kphotoalbum; as a continuous HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this lyre you see here:. as the name suggests, this pops shows you data statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different timelessness. each lyre shows then a different unit. you can change between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you see a part of a database by pointing the groin only 10 minutes sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline allows you to interactive in the following ways: you can view the displayed input view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date is displayed in the preview feature) and in addition, the timeline will always display the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you can navigate in the preview.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by pressing the mouse button, and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, so when selecting an area, you will be displayed in the preview view only pictures of this time period. you can set the selection by clicking on a beam of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; offers you two options available to create HTML-websites with your images. one is integrated into & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other is available as a module (see above). in the following part of the user's manual, the version is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version you can create via the Menu HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you will need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and destination. in the following, each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the blicks and a description that is supposed to include the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML-example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum. -exporters will be created on the overview page. approximate information about the export files you can find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed. thus, you can avoid that information is displayed on the viewer also without a description. for example, all pictures of a party are. you can not use these settings therefore to hide specific images from certain spectators.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how to look the HTML pages. most adjustment possibilities are clear, which is why this is not specifically made.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. therefor, those who want to view your website and have a monitor, which supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no images can download, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time. so he can change your pictures with lower resolution, so as to search a lower transmission time, so if he wants to get an idea bigger he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, you place the different folder and the URL, where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select for all of your HTML files a base folder and for each subsequent sentence a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you must select the root folder in which all your images are stored. this folder is automatically added and the next time you can set. you can choose either a folder or a KDE supported protocol for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your pictures, you can check if this really should be visible for the viewer. if you have created for the base folder a URL will start a web browser after the pages has been created. the URL you set here should start this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the import of you created HTML files still do not have to copy them in the final destination, see, correctly, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the actual files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described above have changed all three to the base folder or URLs. in these, a subfolder will be created, whose name you can specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you're on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; they are, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the images. however, if you have already done a lot of time for watching pictures, recording, etc., then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work will not even be done.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. you can import it into your database. the picture properties are related to ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in it whether the images are stored by the file or if the file is only a link to images. the advantage all images can be stored in the file, that you can share all the images and that this file can be accessed independently. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file either directly from the file, or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches for the pictures in any doubt. first, the images found in the folder of .kim file. the corresponding pictures will not be found, so the pictures of the URL you have indicated in creating HTML files. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML-Export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog is described for the export of images to export something to export.</seg>
<seg id="937">The main option of this dialogue is whether it is to act internal or external .kim files, the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When option manuell to copy the .kim file you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatic near the .kim file copy copied & kphotoalbum; the images are automatically copied for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip-files. as most pictures already have been compressed with JPEG compressed and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you do this, you simply select the option export file compress.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page reads maximum menu size. if you want to send your friends pictures, you might not want to send the images in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size, for example, that each image is at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file importer, it will import & kphotoalbum, the exported databases as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to the importer consists of four steps. at first, you have to select which images you want to import, afterwards, in which folder the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category individuals who are in your database (if you are a Dane), while this category is in part of your database. therefore, you will be imported into the third dialog window, which categories of the imported file should be imported into your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">The fourth step allows you to import the categories of the imported file with the categories of your present database. an example of this can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse these images and to see: if you look at pictures you often want to watch within various picture groups & mdash; if you are looking for example pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the images on which this friend is pictured.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will run the different steps from (1) Festing the information about your paintings, via (2) the diarrhea and prestige to run through (3) advanced themes and adaptations.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was started as a program for the Manage of your pictures. however, it has been extended and today it also takes your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this also closes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their images. these are a simple XML file containing a program of your choice, e.g. normal backup tools, copy on a floppy or revisions in CVS, you can.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; notes the folder in which your images are stored and used it automatically. if you would like to use another database of pictures, you can start a different folder with images, you can run & kphotographs, with the option -c. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the menu entry settings kphotoalbum; setup... go to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum. in the following section of the user-book, you will find the various settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">Links see six different symbols, with which you can preview the options of view and the options for the viewer. for each setting there is an extensive help available to the one button on the F1 button, and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">In it, you describe how you can set different properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and catfish. you can also create your own groups such as items, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You see the dialog, which is used to process existing groups. for each existing group you can choose a marking and symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog options you can establish full member groups, e.g. all members of a group at once in a group instead of declaring all the groups of a member as described in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view of the adjustment possibilities, which are available to you for the capture of the member groups. with the above listed list, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left-hand corner you will find a list of the current category and in the right list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares the module system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & kde; image Plugin Interface. approximate information can be found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called through the menu modules. the modules can and will not be described in this book because they are not part of & kphotoalbum; are they are distributed separately. however, most modules also have a help page which you can call via the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by multiple applications among each other, it may be that the modules were using & kphotoalbum. this is why you should always test new modules first with the demo database, before using it on your own pictures, demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu help. say not, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules on KIPI, are very different, making it be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that are also called KIPI, is that the other applications run their images in albums: this kind of order is not supported, simulates it for some modules the order for albums so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">These simulates & kphotoalbum, the present album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all images, which show you the picture show at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album you have to go up & kphotoalbum; these modules also make a list of albums submitted. on this occasion he goes on & kronalbum. as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If your browser displays the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will have defined the category, which you have specified in the dialog dialog as a category for virtual albums. for example, for example, use the category, will have chosen & kphotoalbum. so, whether you would have selected persons to view and share it with this module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Because some modules are compatible with & kphotoalbum; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the entry dialog and select the area modules that you want to load.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you will see an example of an starting screen, as soon as you start running on your own pictures; you can start your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, see the toolbar you can easily browse the window above. at the moment, you will not find a lot of information about your paintings. in the section we will look back on this window, but then click on the entries to show you an overview with all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the opportunity to view each image with comments. these include information about the persons appearing on the image. you can either set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures specific comments at the same time. if for example, click on all pictures Jesper and all pictures in Copenhagen have been recorded.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want to view these comments if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view you can see three lists with a text box by using people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you will always use it again when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea lies the moving of the images on the list: if you have a family party, and on all 50 paintings, the same 5-10 persons are pictured, you can find that the names of the names are moved up, the people find faster and assign.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to see a alphabetically stored list, click on the icon for Sorting date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected remarks on each image individually, you might want to edit any selected images and provide those images with any notes. in this case simply click the front and back buttons, which are located under the preview of the picture on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to highlight all these images and provided the menu item at a time with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture, you will see a browser window of the USA as a market group. to show you that it is an abundance, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the anadialogs, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. additionally you can also put an entry simply on a category and insert it to make this one subcategory of this item. attention, this requires that you just sort your categories alphabetically. see also.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can shift the single elements of the attracting dialogs by train the groin that form the upper edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make a separate window by setting it outside the window.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you adjust the look of the window to your needs, then you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button below..., which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also leave a box completely. if you want to see this window again later, use the button below... and then window a / hide. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser you get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or any images if you do not have a filter here. you can configure the size of the thumbnails, by simply writing down the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. try it just time.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you leave an image on the background of your desktop, this image is set as background picture for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, it will be displayed in the picture concerned. if you don't have a window with a picture concerned, a new indicator will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the picture preview. simply select the appropriate images that you want to delete or select either the Delete button, or select the menu item to choose from. now, you will see the window you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you for this problem a solution. you can also use it with & kphotoalbum. you can also use the images somewhere else, so you can capture the pictures somewhere, so you can see the view of & kphotoalbum. in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbum. if not all of the needed images can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, where the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for example, images 5-9 are present, however, the previewing images can display. however, you can see the pictures from these images. however, they can not view these images with the picture concerned.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, you need to copy files from the folders and copy them into. & kphotoalbum; therefore, you have not yet to ask for the insertion of the corresponding CD. if you wish to avoid trouble-locking your images, please purchase a bigger disk in order to be able to save all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images you will find a submenu with the name of privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, click on the images so that you want to see for others inaccessible and click on Latest View privacy. alternatively, you can also see all images that may see your little sister, ansteues and the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have set what images in the case of the case will be hidden. if you lock the laptop now your little sister, simply select the menu entry into the menu, rendering all the images you have blocked, and when you want to see the images again, click here.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password to set the images entered. to set this password, simply select password in the menu of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe. for one, all pictures on the hard disk and the other can access the index.xml file to read the password as unencrypted text; not very familiar to those who are using & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to honor the view on private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you manage all of your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with them is of course that you want to see them at some point. this is why you can see them at some point. this is why you can preview them from the preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. it naturally displays the picture, but additional all the information you have displayed about the image, such as who is on the image, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox is on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can easily move it with the mouse and move it elsewhere. all these options are displayed based on the viewer. all these options are available after a right-click menu on the viewer. you can see the logging menu button below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here on the browser, see the suitable entries related to this. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you would choose from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them and go back by using the buttons image high and image. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these features are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run it as a slideshow. like frequently it loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it's a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl button and Plus or minus. also, the slideshow is replaced by the buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the beholder of & kphotoalbum; it is in the full-screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you use the viewer, you can put in the image in the image and sczooming. to the entry point you can simply drag a rectangle. with the minus button you can reverse again rerzooming the plus button zooming in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom-rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can refrain your Zoom on which the image is not shown zoomed. with the same key places the zooms, so that each pixels is in the screen of an image of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only Zoomoperations that work with videos that are in and zooming containing the Plus- and Minacoustics.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the filename from the context menu, you can turn the image. this does not work with videos. you can make comments on the current image with the menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you look at images it can happen that you will find an image with a person whose names you have forgotten to put on the picture. at the moment you can see the check-break and configuration dialog of the picture to give this name. however, you will perhaps prefer to mark the image and see more images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images on paper. to see what photos you want, you can start the viewer with the pictures and visualize them as well or poorly, while you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the spectator offers the possibility to provide photos with features, while you look at them. features are the letters A to Z and you can push a characteristic that you can press the corresponding letter. see a picture in which the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have any features set on your pictures, these are available to you. so, if you have selected all the images you can edit, print or whatever you chose. then, you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD, or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in viewing points. if you can view categories in Dre previews, then you can press some features to the pictures, simply selecting the letters for the character after the picture was chosen. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on an image. this case allows you to paint & kphotoalbum; on the picture to paint.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not stored with the image but in the database. the way you can do it back-old later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In you can see an image on the painted table. to turn the Malmodus of & kphotoalbum. to turn on the picture from the context menu. to finish the cap, you simply put the cross at the toolbar top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you must not control the application of the program & Povray; but the documentation for Povray; should you have read and understand the documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object-tree, you can select individual objects. then, their properties are displayed in the object properties and display the object in the wire modell- views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects simultaneously. but not the object of a previously selected object, since all the objects already are selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon at the toolbar, or select an menu entry into the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following folding menu appears to be built-in, so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deleting either from the menu bar, or from the context menu of the right mouse button you have to remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have altered attributes, click on apply to take these modifications. do you have invalid values, a message will be displayed with a bug description. then you can correct the input content and click on it or re-create changes to abort.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to a Povray; user documentation in the setting of dialog, you can use the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You do need the Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this property. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 will already contain the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit an texture or part of a texture, you can preview a preview in the autonearby view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press your preview in the DIY-view and a small example of the scene is structed with your chosen texture, even if you want to have a subsorted element (for example a texture inside a texture) and not the whole texture (map), you cross locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag this check with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the control points and there will be a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation, as well as the position for reprisons. you can change the shifting through pulling using the mouse within the whole window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Every object has a wire level of view. you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the higher level of view or as an absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their views level smaller or equal in the toolbar-level of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window administration as a default. the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you do not like the default copy, or if you need a different type of order, you can set it on any other hand. you can also save multiple shutters and simply change between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or under one view, drag the start to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle shows then the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the trial to the right or right side of a view. the new view will be installed on the right or left side of this view and covers the whole amount.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you would like to arrange several views over one another, take the beginning in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the box-card from above in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible shutters are pending views, views, which are not enshrined in the main window. to view a view from the filing, drag the starting point to the desktop or click on the small according to the upper left arrow in the address.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross at the address called. to prevent the closing, click the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the menu you can find entries for any type of views. new views are schwebend, you can be anchoring them to any one.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you created a scene, you can rendering it. & kpovmodeler; uses & Povray; 3.1g to rendering this program, was & Povray; 3.5 aktuell. this version is currently in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rendering the current scene, click on the icon Renate To rendering the icon in the toolbar, or select the menu item menu.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A stirring mode corresponds to the entries in a Povray; s ini files. it controls the image size and quality of rendering. if you want a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of Render modes, from a quick preview to full balance of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon of The Render settings in the toolbar, or in the View View Render Modi, the following dialogue will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but makes a name that can be seen the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In map-card size you can insert the width and height of the rounded image. if you just want to rendering a small area of the image, choose the cross-section subsection and indicate the image-section to rendering in the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combination of quality you can select the characteristics that & Povray; for rendering it. this goes from a very simple paint and light model to a model with complex dediffuser reflexions. a detailed description of the Render's properties can be found in the user's manual too & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is tapped with just one ray per pixel, there may be various errors. these images often have a Moirè patterns or layered effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called Anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. in general pictures with this property are better off.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch to anti-aliasing, calculates and links & Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique means super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling is the neighbouring pixels with one. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive because every pixel is continually spread further and adaptive because the retired blew moves from the calculated shades.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, follow POV-Ray to set a ray per pixel. if the difference between color values to the neighboring pixels with super-sampling are processed. if you adjust the deep value to 4, an array of 4x4 additional points is calculated with a deep value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the dyes is divided the predefined threshold, then the pixels are divided into 4 sub-values that can be followed individually and on further subdivision. the maximum depth of the record can be set with the repository.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is that the generation of smokes for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn it, changed & Povray; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last prehiring for quality of the rendering is diffuse reflexion. this is an experimental feature of a Povray; which computed the diffuse of light flexion. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">In this map you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays are not an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for viewing the & Povray; -Consoles. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason for this.</seg>

<seg id="1058">With copying and pasting in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also in your editor.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene is usually rendering. usually this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>

<seg id="1065">You can adjust the item of the points to the Raster in the context-menu of the wire models. you can set the wheel separately for reps, scalations and screentions.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values give a more precise remodel, thus creating better approximation for the indicated objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects like the ball you can set the detailed press for two directions separate.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross the High Components for advanced projection, all wire models are further divided, if the camera uses an advanced projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and the sensing projections. this property brings better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you indicated a wall, a wall is rolled behind the objects. the wall is displayed in a chess brake pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you map to the ground, a floor is displayed below the objects. the floor is shown in a box patterns of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When you activate the cantons, the non-recursive antialiased method is used for rendering the scenes. the values for depth and swelling can be set. accurate information about parameters can be found in the section Render-modes.</seg>

<seg id="1077">You have just installed & Povray; and now you want to start without more exact knowledge of the two programs. if you follow any steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene which is very popular: a bullet on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings, before you make sure you use as a result only a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you set no camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you will receive a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark, and you only receive a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything error-free, take a look at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following voreed panels:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar to learn. please read the documentation that you can expect an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their applications.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. in order to follow this guide, you need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu bar Restarting. hence, you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you generate. specifically, in particular, you notice the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if they click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found in the user's documentation. see more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change anything to the basic settings of the camera, this is later instructions, but note that the camera is in View control points, with which you can change the waypoint of the camera. just click with the left mouse button on a mouse point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you apply the button or press the input modules, the wire model views and the object appears immediately corresponding to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to set the ground for the scene. you could fit for example a quader (insert the finite body collader) and the size at x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a concession method of solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; does indeed offer an simpler possibility. you can use an infinite level as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and press the button below or the input paste. in the object-tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now shows the level even if at the moment only a limited level. if you rendering the scene, the layer extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the property tree exactly, you will find that you can leap the entry for the bottom, if you click on the different parameters for each new object: scale, rotation, and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit among the horizontens so you get to know some of these parameters. select Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Only select the ground to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but you can choose something simple in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog, in which you can select how the object is to be inserted. please select the name in the object-tree view (name = soil pigment), with a click on the button preview, see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of pigment is just one Mattes black material, because you need to enter settings for the pigment. therefore always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. also, there are many possibilities, but now take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you preview not view color on the header and ball, then click on the button below and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the soil is now properly set. if you are using your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following results:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color that you anticipated. here are more settings necessary. in the color list, you will have to choose two new attributes list. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more frequently, but the chessborary list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select at the object tree jedesmal and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should you be able to easily perform as you have understood the fundamental working method of & kpovmodeler; already, the ball is just as easy as the floor to create:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. put the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget the input paste or the button to press), so the ball would float above the ground, since you move the soil to move down there.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering is now a strange result: as previously seen before, the ball sounds like a Mattes black material. put in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material. as already in the ground, you give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first antobject and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on the sphere of pigment, then select one color and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshot and click to apply or push the input paste.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings sheen effect and reflexion gives already partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromium-plated surfaces, even when metallic: not yet selected is:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good idea of what options are you & kpovmodeler; hopefully, you have already learned so much that you can do simple but beautiful sceneries.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a Render method to generate a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you have a scene raytracer, shoots the renderer hypothetical radiation from the perspective of the spectator (d. h. by the camera, which is reflected and broken down, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects have worked like for example mist. so the scene has been processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you view the scene. without a light source, you also see nothing, the picture is just black. obviously, the image needs to be released, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you previously worked with & kpovmodeler;</seg>

<seg id="1125">A Bump-map is a way to predisposable surfaces, without any bump on the surface individually modelling and without the geometrical form of the object itself to change.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file both for a Bump-map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic properties are simple geometric shapes you can use as components: very complex 3D models are made from dozens or even hundreds of these basic objects. these models are then further processed to give them a realistic sense of appearance.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You may need to set existing multimedia outbuttons so that they are working as a Amarok; -circuit commands. this makes your keyboard to the & Amarok; -control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions, which are mostly also available in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is supposed to describe the DCOP features of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browser and scripts. a sample call for the DCOP-function blueprint, such as:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the commandline options of Qt and & kde;. in addition, Amarok has still some own commands options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script should not be executed on account of a missing dependence. please check in your script if all required modules are available and take advantage of it, so that the user does not degenerate, why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'corundum' Rescue Loaderror error = 'corundum (KDE Bindings for Ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'cdialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the folder scripts / Edition you will find a lot of template script in many different languages. they can use them as the basis for your own scripts, or simply add them to the required features. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts always interact with amarok and Amarok. the easiest way is the use of the command dcop;, which should be attached to any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow the outsourcing of external programs and commands. to this end, the function exec is used. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively simply. here an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends messages to all running scriptures. for this reason scripts, scripts have continuously monitor their default version and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can even ignore the events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure displays the script to display the setting dialog. to edit the storing and loading of the setting data, each script must take care of each script. if a script is started, Amarok sets the desktop folder onto the folder, where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signal that a new piece is played. the script could now ask for example: with DCOP additional information on the new piece (for example the metadata or the duckling).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newvolume signaled a change of volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customize Setting: submenu itemTitle contains contains the path to the selected files in the playlist, if a user-defined menu entry can be identified. to remove an entry again, you can use the DCOP-function dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuModule (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok, the script stops, or if the user is stopping a script, sends the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to run such as Auframing. for example, e.g. the store of data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Smoke script administration may also install script packages which can be downloaded from a webserver. such packages are basically normal Tar-archives (.tar), which can also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend a file name such as z.nbsp; B. mean transduc.amarocscript.tar.bz2 so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& AmaroK; 1.3 can only accept Script packages with the Expandment script. for this reason you should rename your script packages right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining to-ladder modules should not be executable. use the Tar-parameter -p to get the file's rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script is ready, you can charge it on www.kde-apps.org and use the link to the Wiki pages page of & Amarok; you should use the category Amarok; script should use the category Amarok; script.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful functions and still is surprisingly simple to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok, you can simply drag music to playlist instead of working through endless menus. perhaps you'll also search for a certain title of thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's Collector's browser and the quick search results you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but can never decide which you would like to hear? then the playlists is just the right thing for you. and if you choose the decision is still hard to choose the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically determine the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>

<seg id="1243">Amarok needs only the package Kdelbs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to find Kallbs (including the programs included, because & Amarok; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have compiled a small guide on how to use Kdelbs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD predict that your window managers will get the relevant standards of freedestop.org. GNOME will function, for example, we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use Kallbs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make a mistake in the taglib library. you can see the file insecure by clicking in ~ / .kde / collection _ scan.log. please report the broken file that cause the crash. after that, you can delete the file and let the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly it is that taglib when reading the Meta information crashes from this file. please report this bug to the taglib developer under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, then try SQLite. the support for it in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>

<seg id="1465">This entry only appears when using an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this is useful when you put files in a previous session into the current project. this is useful when you use files for a multi-file session. it's useful for you to see if this function is not used for you, so that you can already see existing files and folder on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this function allows & K3b; to remove imported files from the current project. all other files do not expire from the medium, it only ends the files imported previously.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Opens the CD heading dialog. this also allows without project-file the copy of a CD onto another medium. alternatively, you can also just burn just an image from a CD, which you can then burn later on. besides, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of normal copying. you should have clarification, if you want to copy CDs using defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Opens the DVD copy of a DVD to another medium. this also allows you to burn just an image of a DVD, which you can then burn later on. besides, there is also the possibility of losing a DVD using the copying dialogue is not yet supported, so the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the entire (video) data of the source media in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog to delete a CD-RW. this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog to the formatting a DVD. with this dialog, you can formulate a DVD ± R (W), whereby the content is completely deleted. & K3b; lets you write the choice between write to write and incrementally.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Burns a previously unstellate CD-picture. the dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a source of data, which can then be used immediately through the gaps of the burning bone. (Neros * .nrg files are currently not supported, so you have to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burns a previously calculated DVD image. the dialog calls you for a * .iso -file as a source of data source, which can then be burned down by pressing the buck button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously generated DVD Video can be transformed. thereby, this dialogue window appears usually after reading a DVD in the content view, but can also be used instead. it contains information about the extracted video, co-ordinances and even possibilities for changing the size and for cutting black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the occasional media. this information is displayed in the content view and contain properties of the medium, such as size and titles in the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of the toolbar of & K3b;. if an entry is crossed, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">When this is crossed, a small loste is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & K3b; and its activities. if this is not crossed, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">Folding the folder view, or out. the folder view is an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives. if the content is activated, its content is displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with features such as media Info, locks and unlock of the drive or ejecting the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Switching the ingredients view one or out. the content view enables the selection and drag files into the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs, provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Switched back to the project view one or out. the header bar is a narrow scope, which is only visible when the project view includes open projects. the header bar has no real function, it looks just pretty, and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This will open a dialogue window to change the buttons for & K3b; after having one of the available commands in the upper part, one can adapt the keypto to it further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the K3b; setup assistant. thus, the correct entitlements can be adjusted to the burning of CDs and DVDs. therefore, system administrator is required, therefore, you must enter the password for the system administrator (root).</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & K3b; here you can set general program settings. nearly all functions of & K3b; should work towards thief. this dialog is for personalisation and hostility of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& K3b; it is, like many other & kde; applications also, using a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of functionality can be controlled through a shell scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; -functions to use, you can either use the command line program dcop, or which some more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the functionscope, therefore more likely your taste and the type of your task is vital, which the accompanying programs you give to.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you use the Command system dcop. to use the & DCOP; -functions, you need to make sure that & K3b; start. then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; -functions which have all & kde; -program according to, supported & K3b; mainly two other parts that are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & K3b; functions as copyCD, formatDVD and other functions for generating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Naomref createDataType () DCOPRef createDataBProject () DCOPRef createAvixDVDProject () _ COP3d () _ COP3d () _ COP3d () void) (Kurl url) (Kurl url) (Kurl url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createAssProject method, you can create a DCOP reference to the newly generated project: DCOPRef (K3b, K3bProject _ Audiocd) and then get a reference to the project by using # dcop K3b K3binterface currentProject Through wiring this reference it is possible to change the project over K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is only applicable on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name, Qstring flags) (curl url, Qstring flags) $setUrl (Qstring path) (Qstring path) (Qstring path, Qstring newname) (Qstring path, Qstring newname) void setVolumeID (Qstring path)</seg>
<seg id="1492">So it's possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then adds files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop K3b K3binterface modateDataType) dcop $PROJECT pateFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; -trigger for & kde;. with it a simple audio CD; s can be read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. also other formats are possible, according to encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface from cdparanoia (for reading & CD files in WAV files on the hard disk) and by many codiers (compressed compression). currently, lame is supported for MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (versive compression). other encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on the machine (stored and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per heading) compressed in the MP3- or OGG format or also in other formats like the lossy FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost any distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must now be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step should lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other Kodierer already exist, it is therefore very likely not necessary to compile something yourself. however, only the Kodierer packages will be installed, which is not used for instance FLAC, its installation is also not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which code-format / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction to Kodierer, Audio Quality and Compressed Factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copying of protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & kaudiences; cdparanoia to read the protection of the audio data from the & CD. if not the firmware of the copy, it is not possible to get a protected audio CD; even though not the mechanisms of copying? simply avoid the purchase of Copier-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While filing only needs to be done (setting up dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is needed), the daily handling towards reading a & CD; on the hard disk will explain. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slender approach of the user interface, about which you can often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoded programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; collect information from the freeDB from the Internet or can work fully without a network being captured manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the commands of the main window. on the page step by step example you will find further information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>

<seg id="1510">Opens the dialog dialog to configure the type of notifications (like protocols, Piepsen) for programming events (such as read the & CD; completed).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the mainsetting dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different map maps (like Encoder, to setup the Encoders). afterwards, you must go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter outlines ton quality, encoders and compression rates, and helps you to choose the right code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a verting free audio format is required. besides FLAC, there are also other such as' hormones, or 'monkey' that may possibly be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that these files can be re-imported.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Under the audio formats, the information generated by data compression depending on its psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG requires a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but about this bitrate, the differences are less important since both codiers produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame is still supplied with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high quality (at high bitrates), but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality for deeper Bitters.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is heard from a computer or a machine-based music system, and / or if one of the few existing OGG devices are available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB Stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto-stereo installations. today - in the beginning 2009 - these devices usually support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting composition of the "lame" (MP3s) (see "lame --help 'for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= this setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer increased transparency for most people and most of the music pieces of acceptable transparency and has already quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereotypes with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereotypes with high quality. this is the preferred option.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs more and 256 kbps for complex and fewer complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereotypes with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a titel. good enough for music by youths, portable devices and autostereosystems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereotypes.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most persons and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information collected manually or by the program automatically fetched from the freeDB via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & kaudiophator; and the Kodiererprogramm to generate the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the Kodierer and these parameters here. the manual or the help of the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">E.g. about the keywords; title to the keywords, when MP3s are coded with lame, the switch is wtt from lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; added. the result is like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiophers; parameters that can be used (= Knock-drawing in the assistants):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freeDB is: a free database, where people can read the audio CD containing information, so that all the other information may be downloaded instead of itself in the calculator. it is note that here only of text spoken: & CD; title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not of the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes it should be legal, but I am supposed to be legal, but I am not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; any more or less worthless, so either the artist can still harm the music company anymore. all information can anyway be given at a stroll through a & CD; shop, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active a approach to choose (sending a address). for the use of freeDB can be used with a different (fake) address as the specified in the system. this type of configuration is not used (This can only be the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">In many countries there are copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator; if & kaudiocreator; for use of freeDB, the geographic area is to be used in the next table. this saves bandwidth in the network and compares the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org delivers a current list of reflection on the on-line call of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which outsourcing program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used to know exactly, seeking in source code... This has always been the best choice for reading Audio-CD; s. to consider that the cdparanoia package needs to be installed from the suitable distribution first if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For storing the WAV files, the Kodierer can be chosen and therefore the desired file format. in the first opening, there are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a versive compression for audio data) on the tab. other Kodierer can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer Package must be installed on the Linux distribution, before the Kodierer can be used. this is also required for the predefined codierer. more information about Kodierer is in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a code, more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a consolder window (eg; Console). here, it must be replaced by the name of the installed body.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the installation of the device drawing of the & CD; / DVD drives, the writing and reading process, and whether both cdparanoia as well as the audio-encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;). try to give both programs using a command line in a terminal. that's an indication of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is one chapter with one step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, everything understood, but somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by example, and you will get enough information to set out those areas exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, everything setup and our first & CD. we will lame '--preset extreme' to use MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. an appropriate package for lame may be found as it is not completely free software. at least, it is not necessary to compile files which you can naturally always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have one of them (eg; by trying to copy with the counter-section).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudiocreator;, something that will probably be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to proceed to read a & CD, what needs to be repeated as a CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the use of cogenres for compression of music (lame) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). as we are used where the files are stored and which structure is used to use the freeDB to download the freeDB files to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not change it with any case of a CD. change even if the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The designment is transferred to the readout program so that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently, / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real dedevice drawing of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, it helps a view to the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the available entries for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">Map Universal Settings. here gibts do not have much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything will be as bellow as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only for complete information can be found so that you will be notified if statements regarding the rendering of keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Map CD; settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and allow the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freeDB computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected while reading the & CD; connected to the Internet, so that it can access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second release field is easier, a & CD included, begins immediately after reading the & CD; it's later dissatisfied with the database entry and the directory name / filename or day entries, they can easily changed with Konqueror &gt; rename and the ID3-tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, further notice: if you want to manually enter everything manually, check out the selection fields and freeDB will not be used. however, this more than 620 MB large, consider this to be worthwhile. in order to use freeDB in the offline mode, the two choices must be selected at least the first one. the mode is set up on the following cardboard card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is a freeDB for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freeDB servers via the Internet. how do you know the system you want to get the CD? read everything as it is shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB servers: please go to the freedb.org page and look for a mirror server in your vicinity. however, the load is distributed among the hosts. however, this setting will work as a first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equally equivalent to the server as though many Firewall the protocol 8880 standardly bocker, there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP; protocol usually is open to surf on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to submit a & CD; data to the freeDB server should enable the first crossroads.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">"" "" "" "cover at the same time: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time when using only one existing drive? Parallelded reading and coding? the author knows it, therefore just trying to try." ""</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the final piece, I cross it to release the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you need this tick, then / must be stored in the folder / folder in which the WAV files is not indicated, the field is not indicated, if you want to make your files in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to make something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything as input it is on the screen foto. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be broken down to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, it is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good hifi stereotypes. the resulting bitrate is average approximately 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of creating tags at version V1 / V1.1.

<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files in WAV files: with DualCore or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to expose more than an WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That is it, we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; completed. this configuration is used as standard for each read of a CD. if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section, the process of reading the & CD is described on the hard drive. we will build MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is built on the hard disk, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB shall be described, and the process of the freeformer has to be described in this section, must be repeated for each corrective & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet included in freeDB, you will see the screen photos a little different from the one & CD; with successfully shown by freeDB files. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually insert it from the internet. comments are found on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not the & CD; this example is to be found. it is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not yet happened, now the & CD has to be defined in the drive, which has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, just as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as audio CD, could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then you may search in the section questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Note: if the & CD was successfully fetched from the freeDB, all the titles of the pieces have already been completed and are also shown the artist's name and album.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; gives a window appears, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the logged field for automatic readings of freeDB (on page & CD), you can also manually trigger this through choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but you need to fetch the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD-Editor - input of the CD-Data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen foto. the title of the song in the first line of the input field 'Current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist should no longer be given in the input field 'Actual Property' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidividuell per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful recall of the data from the freeDB, the CD-editor will not be empty, but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD Editors, so that you are not only satisfied with the artist's and album names (e.g. if all words with large letters are beginning or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use ID3v1-tags. this limited the length of fields on 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the commentary area. if you set ID3v2 tag, at least on what & kaudiophator; maximum allowed. this option is set on the tab tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the day information of the generated files later anytime by day editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags new.</seg>

<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is currently being read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message you can see if you're trying to work with a stove that you have not installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded with a red 'X' in the order list marked.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Incidentally, the folder for the tmp file and the target folders are not what we have given here in example. did you check whether you have to access the folder for the temporary files and the target folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece out, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus, read out the status message in the lower part of the window, it's now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has found no configuration settings to suppress this behavior. the only thing can be configured is the result is unclear. the used machine with a AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding (from however two different poles).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the final song is read, while another piece is coded, and a third order is coded in the queue of the body. after the last piece is coded, a small window is embedded with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>

<seg id="1610">If you are searching for assistance such as the program can be adapted to your needs when it runs, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls up many different programs, has many variations of settings. best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it shows screen photos of different map modes of settings and also contains comments for options that are not used for example.</seg>

<seg id="1613">What's going to? who does this, have probably already started the program. it should look something like that:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author cannot maintain or change this manual. it is considered the first version of a manual too & kaudiocreator; thought. who also always do something usefulness plus change, may it do. at least after the contact with the author. and if you read this, he declared this section and is therefore disagree with this suggestion.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Caraokotieler of & kde;. beside others he does not have real-time graphic and karaoke real-time highlighting, also some properties that have other & UNIX; MIDI Player not.</seg>

<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files (body events or text events). Kmid automatically determines the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. if you want & kde; during the playtime of a song, Kmid starts again with the same song again for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI using synthesizer, Awe, FM and CIS cards (for the latter you need the LUP drivers and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select opening... from the menu file. it will be the usual file dialog with which you can choose the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also let a file of a & konqueror; -window in the & kmid; -window will drop. this also works with several songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and bettering the knowbar in the toolbar, choose the entry to play from the menu piece or pressing the lefash.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece will start automatically, once you draw it to the & kmid; -window will pull. (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then replayed downward.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once Schkmid; a play plays, you can jump to any one place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the template. to get back the original pace, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The leash has two tasks: if a piece is replayed, a pressure on the ledge appears as a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry into the menu, then interrupting the playback. pressing the bucaste during no play will start, starts & kmid; the reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music. some pieces will use text event, others use lyrics, and another both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set what events are to be shown and even better: the event type will automatically detect that a song is used. so if you choose not to manually set the pop text messages in the menu settings. however, you have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set a single event type, select from the menu settings the entries text events and lounging events. the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files you can summarize. these will be played in the series following. in this section you can use collections effectively.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To set a collection, you open at the collectors "collection. this will find you in the menu collection under the item. click New and give the name to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then indicate the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the curfeit im collectors "event.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all the songs you want to do not want to add any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection will not be saved. concerns that if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collectors "collection. there, you can add a song to the button. it appears in again the file dialog, with whose help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting an automatic transmission to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add to the collection is enabled, a piece by opening (under use of file open, or drag & drop) automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically adding to the collection not activated, the opening of a piece is activates the temporary collection and extracted. this collection will then be added to the open pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collector's collection, select the collection and desired song and then click on deletes.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the sequence in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence in order from the submenu of the menu, the songs are shown in sequence, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove any random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in collecting, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump to a song, choose the button next song, the entry next song from the menu or press the button arrow right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back off a song, choose the knowarea previous item, the entry dictate slice from the menu or press the left arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collector's collection, select the collection deleting collection there and click the button Clear.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can not be deleted however, however, that does not play a role as it is in the release of & kmid; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, that are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI Map General-MIDI-events translated into events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI Map, which converts all the events of the Change Patch to Bright Piano in Events of the Change Patch to Trumpet and therefore always leaves a trumpet if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a soundcard, you do not need a MIDI Map, because all the Soundcards are GM -compatible (including Awe - and CIS cards, FM-devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI-maps. so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI Map is a text file, which stores all necessary settings for the playthrough of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. prerequisite for this is, however, that each appearance has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">"" "Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP" "" "Unfine KEYMAP" "" "A further keymap" "" "END Define CHANNELMAP... END Women... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for options) and END that the end of a section is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can be offered for devices that are not general-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard may be deducted. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equator will be ignored. it's believed that the GM -patches in the correct order are (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional ThkeysTo M is needed to place all notes that need this instrument to lay at the tone with the number M. if your keyboard drives a gun (for example with Ton 60), which allows you to toss a drum, e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">Therefore, if a MIDI file should play a touch with patch 127 (shredress), it takes patch 100 (the Drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, irrespective of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term Drum patch the patch is meant that each sound is another Perkussionsinful instrument (Drum, pelvis, Maracas & etc;) and not the one who mean sound the toning of the always identical alloy (like him some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify, like notes on a specific channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you must therefore create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for every channel and tool. you only need to use different names only in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used primarily to form notes on the perkite channel. take a look at the included keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to convert some channels to others. if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel, you just make it the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion to a particular channel (general MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi-devices need 16 channels, CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, and up according to the following patterns:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is needed to form the channel. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap will naturally be defined in the file. if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, whenever Patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to getting the perkite patch on the perkite channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates that the command Pitch-Bender-Event multiplied with the value n, this with the formula n * (r / 4096) is recounted and then only passed. the value 4096 is used so that in the Map file no decimalcommandas are available).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed, because GM proposes that a keyboard, which should play a pitch-Bender-event with the value 4096 to play a tone higher. unfortunately, however, try some keyboards to play two sounds up to an octave higher. to try to try the correct value on your keyboard, you will need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI Map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The cannula view is a window with a whole series of piano drifts (one for each MIDI channel). on these piano, you see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the edge view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer use the original instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The sealing view has (until now) two different views to display the sounds. in view, select Settings Settings under the point of channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed-LCD displays the speed in which a song is replayed. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. so, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow down it. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and to the right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that has to be played like a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, etc.. this allows the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can compel anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 Mb. with a MIDI file you can also change the single instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary (rpm, deb) of & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without Awe support was compiled to fix the issue and install (for example by kmid; 's Home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">To do so, supports & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder that you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, you will necessarily enable the setting of an automatic add to the collection. otherwise, the files in the temporary collection will be added.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can taste the arrow-button on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow the play. to reproduce the default tempo, click on the LCD double button.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on one & kde; workspace a & konqueror; -window with my MIDI File and & kmid (if I want to play a MIDI file lock), or if I want to play a file, simply drag a file, merely move into the & konqueror; move window and draw the desired file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file just quickly without adding them to a collection, turn the setting of automatic transmission to the collection, and the new one; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you only want to play the first file. so, setting up an setting an automatic transmission to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then unlock you, also B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. all thank you so much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, animated me that, further on & kmid; to program.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good soundcard or an external synthesizer, as the sound quality depends on your sound card. it's not the same if you use a FM device or a axwe card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you do not have soundcard, you must compile & cmid; using the MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then goes as if you could have a soundcard, except that you can't hear music of course.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. it always gives the window with the playlist. and finally there is a window display window, which is only then displayed when information is rewritten in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to set up the preferred compounds under the menu bookmarks, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category of Daughty playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an extra hierarchical network. if you enter an entry, his group and all its sub-groups for the current category will be copied and the playback begins with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' actual piece ', television and Daucus playlist may also be modified by direct edit the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do when selecting a editor, but also by using the application itself. simply click on a name of a category clicken from the menu view and next to the clipping a subgroup is shown only the XML content of this part.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, the menu has to be selected from the menu with playlist and choose either the processing mode, or selected another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the processing mode or another group is selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Owing to the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some features can only be switched by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation at Starten and Beenden can be disabled by credit / .kde / share / config / kmplaymate c and Change by [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option on '1'. if the option is not present, it can simply be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate a different animation. & kmplayer; will note the file ~ / .kde / usr / kmplayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at the Starten doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would disturbing the application the application for a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation will be the display of a favourite photos: & lt; adds; adds; adds; adds; adds; adds; / / / home / Koos; / bodygt; In the source package of & kmplayer; are in directory tests / some examples of smil which are supported by & kmplayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider for the configuration of Mplayer in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; here the path from the MPlayer and the clientsary size of the medium can be adjusted from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of mplayer confusing.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playability in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; everything must be configured through a manual approach of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplaymate. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module swfdec-mozilla.</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within a kmplayer; it can even be inserted the special box embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>

<seg id="1726">So that always a blueprint for a particular MIME type is taken (of course only if this was also identified), this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc. for example, phoneon all ogg files can be returned:</seg>

<seg id="1728">For the configment of the VDR (video Data Recorder) Settings in the kmplayer is the dialog to use in the settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be detected ports to be detected by which one is selected (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR can use only Xvideo support (presumably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one working). this is also the videoforlinux extension for the X server functioning properly. for the XFree86 servers must be following the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

<seg id="1742">Latex;: a professional scripts application. under Unix-like systems probably is likely to draw on the package & textile; or & tetex; (for older systems).</seg>
<seg id="1743">Most of these components can be included in the used & Linux distribution. for the installation, the documentation of the distribution or installation CD / DVD should be included.</seg>
<seg id="1744">The & kile; the project contains some pre-compiled packages of & kile; for different distributions; these allow a simple installation without further compiling and are included on the kile; website.</seg>
<seg id="1745">This manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with & latex;, & kite;, & chile; or & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users must hardly be able to read this manual. however, all the suggestions for documentation must be considered. however, the support for this project or documentation would be desired, contact via the kile; website may be produced.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Ask questions about or while compiling of & kile; on or becoming extensions needed, this should be addressed at the mailing list kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.</seg>
<seg id="1748">& kile; is an integrated & latex; -environment for the & kite; -desktop. & kile; offers the possibility to use all & latex; -functions. additionally, offers the possibility to complete, compiling, editing and bug tools for that. in conclusion, the easy-to-use assistant, the & latex; reference and the powerful project administration.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To get more about & Kate; and his opportunities to experience the manual should be attracted to Kate. users of & kile, can start there direct with reading the chapter with the editor of & Kate.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the right choice: lay-TECH. wÃ ¤hrend the urinary & tex; difficult to use, can also use a Laie (engl. lay) & latex; -macros is that it originates from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">WÃ ¤hrend hier just a good disinfection to & latex; given it is not the ultimate book about it. around H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: Document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999 dafÃ ¼ r.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Just as other interpreting languages includes & latex; an introduction, with which the generalizable features such as paper format, side Image and text messages, the body starts with the command\\ begin {Document} and must be closed with the command\\ begin {Document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The quick-level assistant of & kile; is an effective feature for the quick creation of a document in & kile; the selection of the assistant (MENTS) offers some possibilities for creating the document. it can also be done some of the document related settings.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Documentation: herewith, the type of view to be discerning document: article (article), text [report], report [report], report [report], article (DIN) [polyline], projector [Beamer], projector [prosper] or user-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Coding: it is called the character encoding of the system. modern systems are increasingly used the UTF-8 -coding as standard. best, UTF-8x should be used (the correct processing of the & latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list features the most commonly used additional packets for & latex;. for inclusion, it only will only be summed in the crossroad.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), Book (DIN), Report (DIN), Report (DIN): the documentations of Koma-Script (adherence to the German DIN regulations). you should always use the creation of german text.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users will now have to worry about. it is simply a brief description of the functions and further information in this section are given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& kile, offering - just as other source code editors - the highlighting of the commands, settings and elements (and the inappropriate). through & kile; you should have noticed that any mathematical environment is not closed. however, it is often noticeably saves it through the modest appearance of the output file. however, it will save you through the highlighting time and moves forward.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With the automatic verification of the environments, by entering a new instruction (eg.\\ begin {command}) from & kile; automatically a blank file (entering the text) and the associated line (e.g.\\\\ instruction}). this function can be disabled in the MENU settings; returns... LaTeX commands will be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; required the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the most common and substating element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structural noises, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single mouse click on the individual.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful though. as soon as a DVI; filename file (engl. D e V ice I ndependent File)] was created, jumps & kile; by a click with the middle mouse button on the DVI; -viewer on the appropriate line in & latex; -source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contained a description of the formatted document and also other information like the font and is adjacent to PDF automaton output of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for view, conversion and printing of DVI; -files for different systems and tintments.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the return, the elements of the DVI; file with the editor allows, and as soon as an element in the DVI; file search is sung, becomes the exact opposite of it. once upon a section in the & latex; code stext was shocked, it is sung to the corresponding location in DVI; -viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other incorporated .tex files is simplified. in the use of a project a project-wide master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Fast construction: the & latex; code-code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">Filtration: in this mode, the DVI; -File at Ã ¼ nderver- provides resitjacket and is not a call by & eyepiece; after the quickening.</seg>
<seg id="1769">In consideration of the toolbar the toolbar should be implemented for the quick introduction of common items into the document. the first selection field is designed to quickly insertion of the document in parts, chapter, sections,... The reckled & latex; commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The inscription Additional is for example from articles such as tags, filling notes, or references. the specifies possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a paragraph, an image or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: will be used for a reference to a fixed name (selection or selection of a selection.)</seg>
<seg id="1773">When dealing from quote is displayed a selection list with literary entries. the author doesn't work if the file is required to a project. for the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the author can have good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib; files can also be written in & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection field with the name FÃ ¶ Ã ¼ r e is used for determining the scriptures. it can be defined as the main text, the futher notes etc. there are the following characters:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; there are two selection of options: 1. the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document and the restricting of the settings. 2. the document may be written by reason to hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The staples after the command\\ Documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] defines the font. if the scriptures has not fixed at the beginning, this can also be igned in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the obsession code has been entered it is to compile & latex; code-text will be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the MENA building or the button-growing fast construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The code-text must be stored in front of the compile. & kile; add the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Slim the compiling of the document errors, should be sought in the proceeding according to errors. when using fretance, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, it should also be considered the logging.</seg>
<seg id="1780">A environment (enf. environment) is a text that is different from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the writer, is intended to have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ HUGE and\\ giving {environment} emaileth the Ã ¼ racy of the font.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The distribution is only within the area (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}. there are no signs (Number) for the aid in an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are lots of possibilities to increase the legibility and ease of use of the document. it can include certain fonts, fat printing, cursivpressure, submissions, etc. add or end either with the command\\ or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the cimprint and is long as long as he is closed with a\\ end {emph} or any other environment. a single word in a set can be displayed with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ rate: creates a quote in the document. quote starts with\\ begin {rate} and ends with\\ end {rate}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Once the background is presented to writing the source with the & latex; recording facility, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the assistant a bit of text was typed, some adjustments to be performed for the better readability of the document. therefore, there should be a quotation, a few positions in the fat and cursivprint and a poem to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document was viewed, via editor's View or Ctrl is returned to the editor (for internal beholder). at an external viewer, its windows must be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file was created, the document can be printed or translated into a PostScript file; simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">HDMI; is a gerent file format (engl. D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; oder & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi edition as printer, & PostScript; / PDF -converting or computerscreens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file is the same steps as for the preparation of document (see). in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can be printed (in the viewer) printed (if the printer is set properly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar worshipped the transformation of the DVI; file into other formats. as soon as the DVI; -file dating from the & latex; code stext was created, the conversion can begin in selected other formats by means of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The prediction search for the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI; -file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a corresponding adjustment for all & latex; -connection files. this includes only Modern in attitudes toile... tools beauen balanced.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To honouring the anticipation, the mouse-cursor is positioned in a line of the source code and asleep on prediction search. the jump to the appropriate place on the screen; -viewer are made then.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button on the DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document of & kile; used and used to appropriate line. this must be defined as a text editor (Settepiece des... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should case in case of quickening of the & DVI; -viewers not fit, there may be a mistake. should an error occurs, this is shown in the log file or in the message window in the window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file characterizes the error source in the source code. in the editor you can see the correct of the previous LaTeX flaws and error occurred between the errors. the logs file is always possible to click on the faulty line. to click on the faulty line and & kile, jumps to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once upon the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears to choose the templates for use for document. the presences are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">Selecting a blank document, a document can be used either from scratch or the assistant to quickly create a new document. more information on this can be included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Ugly users of & latex; normally use the same introduction for almost all documents. Templates in & kile; compiled, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either needs an existing & tex; - / latex; file, or a new file will be created. & kile; can create a new template using an existing document and selection from document template...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document of a template using file, some chars are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set in attitudes toile... settings different.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is necessary to know which chards are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering the document class. typically, it will be used as follows:\\ Documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the filtration of the commands in the Editor. once the document has been created, the following steps has been taken:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document then its own template instead of the standard holds.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be made of any & latex; file files are created. if a simple way to create a template is required, it should be sought by the Internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; uses & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is an editor for a programmer with the possibility of reading and highlighting from many different types of text files (including also & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings can be performed directly from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To experience more Ã ¼ e & Kate; and its possibilities should be attracted to Kate. users of & kile; can start there with the reading of the chapter with the editor of & Kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; commanding reference, which can be called the MENU-help LaTeX-reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; use, as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click with pushed strg key to wander the & tex; word. this means that in this way, clicking on\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1812">At the drag of the text with penetrated left mouse button, the text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow buttons with engraved output taste, can be classified parts of the source in the editors window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile. has the possibilities to search for different types of source codes and emphasise them. for example, the & latex; commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Lots of wizards can choose wet inlets. thereby it is a separate type of bookmarks within the text. it is also a keynote cover or the corresponding keynote address, so this Sprungmars was highlighted, so that in the first input of a drawing is automatically highlighted.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Working is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & kile. although & Kate; for example, great features have been added in & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; filtered there are always many environments and groups and therefore undermines, special commands for their selection. under Beverages, the following commands are included for the text of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1817">WÃ ¤hlt a complete paragraph (group of lines included on both sides a blank lines). this extended meaning is not included with it tables, & latex; -commands and all other lines of the source; is thus that the deducted cause is separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">WÃ ¤hlt the word under the current Curd position. this choice also has an extended meaning because this command also has a latex; -commands with a return-line (\\) and a bad star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For the length of a part of the document it can be seen and by wires the button Entf. & Kate; it offers the keyring Ctrl; K with which the whole line will be removed. & kile; with own commands, offers a faster panel. among fertilization, the following commands are included for the length of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description to machining documents.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore it offers & kile; for some other commands under Beworks surroundings for a powerful, simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command the start of the current environment is sung (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to the nearby construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command the end of the current environment is sung (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the mould making in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or within the command\\ begin {surroundings}, is sung to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many rubbying environment commands may be quickly the Ã ¼ berblick you can get lost. this command resumes the last used environment, so that the axle environment structure will not be crushed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special orders for the & latex; -groups that are determined by braces {...}. among Beworks TeX group are a few important commands, those who comply with Beaming environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command the start of the current group is sung (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the curved clamps.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command the end of the current group is sung (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curved clamps.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the curly brate of a & tex; group # is located to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering a lot of interlocking groups, brackets can quickly get lost. this command ashing the last used group, so that the fetched structure of the & tex; -groups are not crushed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple beginnings used as a bed; for example, the sign of character is used in & kile, the sign "for two simple character. also, for example, the character is" used. & kile; also knows this case and add two assign of character as a latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic addition of double points of the double character can be set up under Settings Kile... LaTeX and will be reared.</seg>
<seg id="1833">There are some other languages used (eg. ngerman or French) and thus German or franzÃ ¶ sische formations. there are also many other languages to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1834">In the drums of Shift; integration constraints & kile; an intelligent Zeilenefan. if the current position is located within a lists -environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), for example a Zeilenumbruch, but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Inside a tables area close provisioned & kile; the current line with\\\\ with a close break-out separation.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to preset preset & latex; - or user-defined environments to be supported. these can be added under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to classify the columns in tables and thereby all the Et characters (amp;) among each other. & kile; tries to cope with each other. when this tabulator is required, not the troubless, for the columns to the current tabulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already a good source code designation offers, it was incorporated in & kile; about special commands (usually fÃ ¼ r & latex;). they work three according to demand and the other two are suitable for automatic verification. all of these modes can be adjusted for different workplaces under Settings... complete.</seg>
<seg id="1839">In the beginning a new environment using the command\\ begin {surroundings} is & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {Surrounding} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">While the return of the Raiment taste will be removed the last letter of the input and want to collect the complete list. on the other hand, the list may be smaller by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are removed from a command, so that a simple jump to these positions by means of employing Sprungbrand NÃ ¤chste Sprungmarke possible and can be classified relative.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings kile; setup any settings to these lists are to be made. there can be different wardiary lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as instructions of the general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command line mode is for the comprehensibility of environments not bad. it will always have a few letters with\\ begin and the call for the comprehensibility. on the other hand, the environments often used so often that & kile; a special mode for the processing of environments for permits.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the full-hauling mode, the cable-bearing mower-mode is automatically launches the command and it appears\\ begin. after that, the environment can be carried out in the easiest way and by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is accomplished, the surroundings are automatically closed again. once & kile, realises that it is a list of lists, is even a first\\ item -command with one.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings kile; setup any settings to these lists can be done. this mode uses the WÃ ¶ rterlist of the Theidigal mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& kile, underlined the user-defined lists of cuts, which can be installed immediately through the literary character string. the lists can be set up under Settings Kile. as an example, the file example.cwl, in which example the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, the letter L will be typed, for example, the letter has entered, and the word Disabled Strg + Alt Leertaste, the code will be replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">GroÃ ¤s e WÃ ¶ rterbÃ ¼ cher are not helpful for automatic verification in a document more than once. thus, it offers & kile; the comprehensible for everyone already written.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be adapted in the MENU-settings cile... Kile amplifier. here, the swelling will be specified for the display of the comprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The full-digit files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / kile / complete / mode / of the persÃ ¶ nant Home folder. mode is related to breviation (AbdomÃ ¤rter), dictionary (wÃ ¶ rterbook) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The dialog graphics are designed to create graphics as easy as possible. to mitigate the fundamentals of basic video formats, the sections should be clicked and notice.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well known as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for fixing and rearrangement of pages. will be used to edit the pages with a few & PostScript; tools newly arranged and then switched with ps2pdf to a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To take the result of work to be missed, the source code has to be compiled into the source code. all construction tools are grouped into the MENA creating compiling, building and construct.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For the compiling of the source code for viewers, like & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used for the keyboard. after that, the DVI; -file is viewed by means of Alt; 4, by means of Alt; 4 the DVI; file into a PS file and be viewed by means; 5 the PS file is seen.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the instruction superstructure is normally called a spectator after the compiling. should not be inserted into the viewer, then every new window will each be installed.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project is launching the project New Project.... here the following information is queried for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">In the filtering of the filename window, the relative path must be specified from the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The script function of & kile; allows the filtering of ECMAScript -Kode. the scripts can be managed in the vertical scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API-scripts have not yet been developed and can be found in further versions of & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the analysis of the scripts in & kile; a system-wide object (= kile) with the following methods:</seg>
<seg id="1862">Latex; is a rather sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of appropriate packages.</seg>
<seg id="1863">& tetex; and & texlive; are delivered with many documents. included are a documentation for the included packages and another & latex; reference.</seg>
<seg id="1864">A complete speaker, for & tex; and seineâ Liundeâ entails. this is not just a description of all the programs (but a few important packages are described) but is therefore ideal for searching for a certain formatting. since this is a very large document, it is split into a very large document; it is divided into three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Due to the amount of documents using them & tetex; / texlive; the use of the right document is not always easy. as possible help, the small application texdoctk offers, the small application texvastk, which holds a database with all the requested documents and outputs of a graphical area of surface.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the advantage is the search for parcel names or stroke. from & kile, only the results are displayed.</seg>

<seg id="1957">Standard strings: the encoding of newly created or in other ways other than with file opening files (where the coding of the file can be overbypassed). but this setting is translated from the same in the project Properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not detected, but this setting is done from the same in the project Properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy of a backup copy: & quantitative backup copies, so that in a power cut or crash at the next start of the program the document from this backup can be restored. this is not the same as the saving of the file. also, for yet not stored documents, a backup is produced regularly, according to the provided time.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: is this activated, then testet & quantaplus; whether the correct information is correct. pick the storing of the entry also if the plugin is not available in the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantitlus; ab Version 3.3, the troubleshooting was completely new. the support for the non-necessary built-built & PHP; (3) Debugger has been adjusted, as well as the support for the dbg debugger. instead of this became a debugger-Plugin concept that allows various implementations about plug-ins.</seg>

<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, means, I decided to create a button knob as a symbol. through the use of green (green is usually interpreted as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user would signaled that the click of this symbol is one & lt; startup; -tag will fit in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it must still be linked to action. this happens via the menu with settings actions... (in & quantitlus;) and selection of desired action. besides the text field there is one button, press him.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Push the action button and continue with other tags, so there are, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to complement several Common & quantitlus; -functions to the toolbar, or set it in a better overview of some separator into several groups. Set the toolbar set out dialog across settings toolbar. make sure that the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (from left top) for my toolbar. according to the selection of the element it is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow-taste to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add the toolbar to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support the grouping. anyone who doesn't know my toolbar, could believe that the & konqueror; -button the opposite of the start-button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested through donations of all symbols, to ensure that everything works.</seg>

<seg id="2057">Maybe the most noteworthy enhancement of & quantitlus; add to the ordinary users the possibility to documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter, as I create a & PHP; -Documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could consider in the & quantaplus; -Repository, whether someone has done so for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc. language search. then you need to create the docrc file. the first part we will leave you, the second one we handle here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the Documentation files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index top item = Your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 _ html _ html _ 1 = tag2.html _ 2 = tag2.html _ 3 = tag2.html _ 3 = tag3.html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _ html _</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentary tree. for instance, you see now in the & PHP; documentation is such a thing:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level Important = introduction, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html _ import,... introduction = introduction.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic Reference = language.basic-syntax .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before the non-started and Language Reference. this indicates that the subfolder in the tree is concerned with its own content. there is no known limit for the pitudinal version (except for reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the index is referenced directly to a file (and consistently at the top of the tree sight & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & and & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resourcendateien.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The table-section is the area of the docrc file which is intended to display the context of context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script required the documentation to be displayed directly. by flagging the function named and pressures of Ctrl; H for context-help the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the contextlist (Contacts List) and the file-binding.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of scattering context-elements that are to be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can simply save your file docrc and save it to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc / apps / quanta / doc / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then, create a folder (so, as you have indicated this in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and it's worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. the documentation have been used to the & quantitlus; -Repository for use by the & quantitlus; -Community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked on the best web-platform platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantitlus; are you not alone. it is possible to divide the declassified resources (DTEP packages, workstations with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else to whom. at different places there is an email to send, such as DTD DTD's package (DTEP) with e-mail, toolbar-toolbar with e-mail, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main Archive, from where all the other & quantitlus; -users can download it. the contributions are reviewed and only available when our team needs them as correct and user-fully for publication. in order to ensure a beneficial contribution, the origin of the resources is assured, both for our team and later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When loaded, you are asked for your passport for their private GPG-key (the passphrase is not stored), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can redistribute a single resource. in the dialog New resource must be loaded (URL preview is empty) and by clicking on OK the upload will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The upload can upload from the menus DTD DTD-Package (DTEP) to upload the toolbar toolbar, and in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and scripts Tree ™.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading of a resource, still prior to installation, examines & quantitative. in case of problems warns it and it can then be canceled. please note the warning messages carefully. if integrity is given and the resource correctly is signed, a message appears with the indication of the author of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML-languages that is currently not yet supported by & quantitlus; however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of day files in the day-XML format could be necessary. it gives the simplest way to transform a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD shop and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which is to be used. afterwards the following dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target name: the newly created & DTEP; will be written using this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitionline: the string string that appear in! DocBook Day, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Tuning of the DTEP after conversion: if activated, brings & quantitlus; after the transformation the & descriptionrc; -Editor, with the details of newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In the quantitlus, there are some key concepts. to understand this and get full benefit from & quantitlus; therefore, one needs to bring them exactly these concepts with these fundamental concepts without their understanding & quantitlus; little utility.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantitlus, working area divided into three parts: global, local and project-related. this distinction affects a number of components in and quantitlus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantitlus; uses, available. from workstations about actions, everything is selected as globally, in the common folder structure of & quantitative data. this enables the administrators to secure different workstations, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will then be available in a multiuser environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development strategies for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbar. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be anything of & CSS; -patterns to toolbar especially for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder-tree of the project, which means the common usage of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editors window, the treviews with information and the toolbar, please propose and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the box with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document, such as close the current, other or all map, newly recharging, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmarking or version of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click on the editing range, lead to another context menu regarding the written document contents, such as basic processing steps (output / paste / paste), editing of the file under the mouse button, or opening the file, when the string is referred to under the mouse-cursor a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the Editorfensters are the toolbar of the editors. currently, & HTML; 4.01 transitional is shown as default, for which a set of toolbar is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantitlus; the toolbar is adapted to the new functions and the associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar is really light. if they want to insert them into a single day, then click the icon that represents the day. now, you can enter the data for this just added day. if you want to insert the data for this just one day (like anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The Baumansights (QIT) allow it to navigate and navigate in the information, to navigate and understrip them. in the presentation with cardboard boxes, document structure, scripts, scripts and documentation construction sites available.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool, the & quantitative tool which provides. this view displays all files in the project and allows the defering of the files in the project by right mouse-click. actions like Adding, removal, uploading or deleting the files from the storage medium can be done with the indicated context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantitlus; is the use of templates. nearly everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be split into three categories, depending on how they use. global templates are always available, local styles only available for the corresponding users and templates on projects are available only in the project. more on templates is available in.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script. you need additional functions, such as the script should start, edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by links-clicking of the element, the cursor is set in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking of the element there is a list of commands with regards to navigation and refresher the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree-views. with it, some attributes and namespes can change. this leads to the content aligned manually, the changes of all available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. it can be downloaded pre-extracted documentation for & quantitative; 'Documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder into a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantitative, two card-fronts at the bottom end of the window, can be achieved through the usainable information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This map Leading displays information about each in Quanta running script. so, for example, the DTD used the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This map Leading displays every mistake in the market-up of the current document. & quantitlus; -Scripts, which are executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantitlus; workstations are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command shown. the chocolate bar the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in and quantitlus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantitlus; is the skill to send a toolbar to send an email. & quantitative Tar-Archive via & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can save it in and quantitlus, like any other.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable when you want to adjust the location of & quantitlus; files to your system. therefore, autoconf have a number of options to pass to the configure script. to give a complete list of all options, please give. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not running here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems at the starting of & quantitlus, you should check whether your path contains the & kde; 3 am a folder. also, you should ensure that there is no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH in front of your bin folder. the same goes for & Qt;.</seg>

<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and toolbar. it can give in a project many views, i.e., by simple exchanging the view, diverse files and toolbar can be loaded and replace the currently open files and toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored in the menu project or project toolbar, available via settings-toolbar-toolbar, opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of Hquantitative lus, with which one has to do most. this does not only improve productivity, but also allows adaptation of & quantitlus; to its own working method.</seg>

<seg id="2198">Some with & quantitlus; included templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions attached at the beginning of each template quoted before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binär is everything that is not pure lyrics. it can be any file except text, so pictures, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually inserted in documents using shortcuts (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url). some information on the templates are available in templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be used by any text document type. based on these templates, new documents can be created. normally, a simple frame for the purpose and runs the work in appropriate way to be efficiently. some examples may be found in advance tree under global templates. see for more information on the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful when not a new document to be inserted on a template, but the same text area will always be included in documents. some examples may be found in the preamp tree under global templates. see in for more information on the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are used for entire websites as templates. they are a collection of different documents, which can be organized in a compressed tar archive. at present there are not examples in a capsule form.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure by Belieben (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc.) and select File Now as a template it save as a local template!</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, notice that (even if it is stored as a project location) the template is not visible in the project-tree. look in the preamp tree under project specifications.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and save to file as a template store selection as a local / project location. alternatively, the selection can be easily drawn to pulling and insert on the site template.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The production of binary templates is simple: the file is only to copy into a template folder. it can be used all file management functions, such as pulling and inserting or inserting the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select either in the file tree or in the project files. select a name for the template and backup site template. by default, it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project proposals enable a very target-oriented approach. you can pre-create headlines and footprint or dynamic with & PHP; you can insert files or connect them with them. additionally, you can keep a few things in mind in dealing with initiatives in projects very profound.</seg>

<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder list, click the folder overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu properties. the following dialogue will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is canceled as soon as Elterous attributes have been halted.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the tribe of the deposits. if a trunk-folder would be set up, it would specifically disable in this path, except they would be explicitly activated. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like a text element. if nothing appears, one is probably in a trunk-folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows previous or thoughtful text for templates in this folder. this could be general Headlines and headlines for all templates for a particular project and allows to equip a whole presentation already with the matching Headlines / footprint.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have the right-click menu (pointing, right mouse button) on a complete command from folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantitlus, offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & HTML-Editor, which tells about the menu view. the first mode replaces the source code editor through the VPL; the Editor and the Second Figure shares in two parts: the source Editor and the VPL; -Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">VPL; -Editor works as follows: he invites a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can switch to edit and when needed to source code editor, in which the changes made in VPL; -Editor in source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -Editor on a document, the & PHP; includes, it shows a small green symbol the Vohandion of & PHP; code editor. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; Data Editor, continues to edit the code editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode functions exactly as the first one, except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source editor and the cursor in the source code Editor and in VPL; -Editor synchron is activated. with pressures of F9, this mode is already active, the keynote puts the active cursor from a window to another, whereby the position in the document is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation stand between the VPL; -Editor and the source code editor allows to select Settisation after a click or automatically. in the selection automatically, you can choose between synchronisation after a click or automatically. in principle the recommendation applies: a small spanking for quick calculators and a big spanking for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so Tools Documentation is possible to choose. with this, the processing of invisible tags at work with the VPL; the editor will also be called when a new document with the VPL; the editor will be created, and this is the reduction of the suspension of the pendent Kodierens.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags allows the storage of information on the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines. Meta-elements can be added by pieces of the two buttons below or removed. a click in the list enables the modification of the content, such as key words on the column name and key word key on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS-rules are the new way of designing the design of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list or delete a change on the list is exactly as possible with the meta elements. the editing of CSS rules is currently not currently supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS-style location by pressing on the file-open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is like in a text processing, possible thanks to the arrows, possible. among rare circumstances the cursor is working as usual. text can be inserted through one-type and be deleted by backtaste or removing button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags will be done in the same manner via the toolbar, as in the code editor. it is note that inserting tags previously already existing identical tags will not be removed, e.g. if a anchor day, surrounded by text, each other realms must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbar like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled. they are later published in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists are to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for examining the style templates. in contrast to other programs for breastfeed runs, the search for specific elements is possible and the execution of the style template is followed.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparisons. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merging was very complicated, because one of the respondents have done many changes and at the same time had corrected the settling in many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts in together.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used to me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no evidence on the places where perhaps only the herbulation had changed. that made these changes was a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So that was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white signs. later, more useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you would like to compare text to an example, just copy it to the clipboard and insert it into one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that did a lot of work was the comparisons and assembled from folders. this function changed & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way-assembled is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently of each other at a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows 3 Quell files at the same time:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you with the comparisons and merge complete folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; at the folder-together:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and renounces the possibilities of today's color monitore. if you have frequently asked Kode, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tablers are displayed visible. if rows are only different in a certain number of white signs, you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left. (no hassle more, if someone changes the recess.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is equal and the other is different in one line then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files are the same names, but in different folders, you can make your tipwork easier by writing only the filename in the first file.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Gramed 3 folder-2 folders, kdiff3 folders, kdiff3 folders, kdiff3 folders, kdiff3 folders, 2 folders, 2 folders, 2 folders</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog permits the manual type of filename, the selection of the file browser (file...) or selecting a lastly-opened file from the list. you do not need to specify the third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of differences between two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the knofolder... you can also select a folder. if you choose a folder, the comparison will be selected, for B and C however a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the filename from A to the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If collapsed, the input field is active for purpose and can be dealt with. however, it is not necessarily necessary to specify a output file later. you can handle this step later on the store.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button will open a dialog with settings. here you can specify options before starting with the comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text components from the clipboard into the active comparative window. the comparison starts then immediately. in opening dialogue, you do not need to select files, you can simply enter the dialog with the Cancel-button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop off, just drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let him fall over a comparision window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind it? sometimes contains a file for example, several similar features. if you want to find out how similar to these features, it would be a relatively large effort. you'd only need to create two corresponding files, put them into & kdiff3; now you can copy the relevant sections simply, paste and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can't delete anything from & kdiff3; just drag the falling out of text into a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and breakdown of text into another program than cutting and pasting (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case, your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the info-line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest a while above the line. then a small help window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source code are the letters A, B and C assigned. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be modified via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is realised, one sees in the color that file differs. if both files differ, the preset colour is red. (colour for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files. that's in the next section (bring together) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left besides the text there is the summarize column. if differences were found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages the colour is not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +), white signs are relevant only in string and commissions, for the preprocessor and in few, rare single cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, divides the summarize column of the text is interrupted in the points where the relevant source file has no lines. if the Zeilenumbruch is activated, the line is dotted at enclosed lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparisons) also has a info-line with the inscription edition:, the filenames and [changed] when you have edited the result. usually, it contains already text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, the storing is disabled!!! (use the buttons to the nearest / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons use are used, every difference appears at the same time a conflict that has to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking the left mouse button in one of the windows the first line of the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. (this will also be a jump of position in the windows, where the top of the group is otherwise not visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for the current range and on the left hand a black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, by automatic transmuting or by manuals, no more line is left in the group; then, in these lines the text is displayed; no line in the quoted, then you may change your mind and perhaps another source. this text appears either in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you might just copy and insert them elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merging panel, however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. go cautiously with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources the options ignore or ignorance C / C + + comments are enabled, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This navigates mainly with the image running and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are in one of the windows, you can use the arrow buttons, right, top, trl-beginning and strg end, sip as you can also used by other programs. the excess column next to the vertical machine bar can also be used to the Naviins.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the Augabefenster you can also use the other keys to machining. with the insertion button you can switch between entry and transfer mode. (preset is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summarizing columns, synchronizes the view of all windows to the top of each group (as already in the section) and the editable output argument was explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the next / previous conflict (Strg-bottom / Strg-above), to the next / previous conflict (Strg-Picture Away) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Picture Away) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Picture Abway) or to the next / previous conflict will continue to solve as conflict. therefore, between detached and unresolved conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the markings into the clipboard, you must press the Copy button-button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insertion). if this option is activated, whatever you mark, automatically puts into the clipboard and be careful with this option but carefully, as you could slower the content of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilenenden will be saved according to the underlying operating system. Unix-variants are using a Zeilenvorschub\\ r\. Kdiff3 keeps the Zeilenvorschub\\ r\. Kdiffuser does not keep Zeilenenden of source files not, so you should use & kdiff3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of last used files will be automatically saved and restored at the next start. (menu Settings- &gt; Kdiff3 Options...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with a fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog provides you with variabler width to choose from, you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you activate this option, differences are displayed in Kursiver writing. if the chosen script does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be illustrated. on these systems the button presets is automatically an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, when pressing the tabulator key, the appropriate number of spaces are inserted. otherwise, a tabulator notes is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you put entering or return, the entry of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection will automatically be copied into the clipboard. the manual manually copy the clipboard then.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which Zeilenende type you can store for storing. the preset value is the generally usual choice on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">While the same of files sought & kdiff3; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white signs can be ignored. the second step compares each row. in this step, white signs will not be ignored. also, while together, white signs will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a Weilenvors'\ 'at the end of a line, others can only look identical. if this option is activated, Wagenedervors appear, however, like a whiteboard used. during which together, this option must be disabled. in addition, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In preference, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis are numbers and related characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-'). in the result, the differences are shown nevertheless, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In preference, this option is disabled. changes in comments will be treated like changes in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive search for even smaller differences. the option is activated in default. it is effectively with complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the automatic jump-off mode determines this setting how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict is continuing.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solve automatic all conflicts in white signs using the chosen file as a source. (preset is manual selection.) That is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you just need this from time to time, then use the automatic selection also conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignorance C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter to Scannen of folders and run by a gathering. look for details under documentation to the directory-compare and contours.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version exists the Suffix .orig. if already there is already such a backupfile with the Suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the user interface. the changement of this option does not affect the current program. you need & kdiff3; end and reboot that the change is active. (this option is set in the KDE Version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is gathered there globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following co-settings can be adjusted for each entry separately. if you activate this option, the top settings will be applied for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection of paths for coding is a brief reference, which is the local coding. (this can not be changed here and has a purely informal nature.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file code for source files. this influences on how special characters can be treated and interprets. as the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared and combined with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding for the storing should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing wire, they might not work with your codec. (e.g., your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing wire can be used only with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output from pre-processing poles.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to press highlighting changes in white signs into the text or review of nails. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignorance C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences between two of three files will be displayed. but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files. -gt; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is shown next to the normal nor a second overhead column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the space on the screen for long lines. blending you simply use the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Inserting window side by side or overturn. this can also be useful for viewing long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes, consider the differences and then decide to bring the files together. a simple click will start together. a simple click will start the filename and use the filename of the last source file as preset names for output file. (if this function is used to perform the merge again, then the name of the last used output file will be kept.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it is transferred first to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor, which corresponds exactly to your requirements. you can use this function for example to cut odd parts or to correct the recitation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">While reading a file it is handed over to this external command. if a normal default command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is only used in line processing. you can write your own preprocessor that corresponds exactly your requirements. each input row must have an associated issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind it, allow the user more flexibility in setting up the slide results. but for this, an external program requires, and most users do not want to program itself. however, the good news is that in most cases be sed or perl completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this process command for Zeilenabra to convert the input into big letters: sed's /\\\\\ n /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'The\\ 1 contained in a row.\\ 1 contained in a row string refers to the found text in the first staple string.\\ U converts the found text in big letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might begin to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs which support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring numbers is actually a already built-in function in Kdiff3. but it's good for example for a further pre-processing wire for Zeilenlike most suitable. sed / [0123456730.00 -] / / g 'Jeze sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several repeats once. then you can separate the semicolon ';' to separate the settings of each other:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead, sed you can also use something else like perl. perl -p's / REGEXP / replacement / switch 'allerdings are in perl some details different. where sed\\ (and\\) required, perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after normal pre-processor will be kept for display and consolidation. further operations change only the data that the Zeilenic-Algorythmus can see.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal Preprocessor, the Zeilenabra requires the output of the normal price processor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text does not change or differences, you can not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often you need to edit programmers in a folder many files. this is why you can compare with & kdiff3; complete folder rekursively and merge together.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes for every object a suggestion to bring together; you can adjust the suggestion in front of your start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate that and displays the simulated changes without being really performing,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... selected selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparisons and merge individual files very similar. you only need to open a folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are assembled, folder 1 is used as base. if no target folder, used, uses & kdiff3; folders.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, do not execute them. to execute the corresponding menu item or press the F7 key (see further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will notify you a small message window of the current progress. if you break down the folder, only the files are listed until then were compared.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scanning is complete, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folder that was found during the scan, is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a single mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can double a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or by using the arrow buttons for left / right. the directory listing includes two functions All subdirectories and clapping with which you can catch up all the folders and folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, the file comparison will start and it appears a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the type of file is different in the other folder, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the collation action may not be selected automatically. if that will perform together, you will be notified about problems of this kind again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the above picture, are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, the colour is also identical, although the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folder will be regarded as identical if their entire content is identical. then, also folder the same color. at folders, the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea to this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a paper which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red becomes.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C not have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a folder and B): error: contradictory data types. as long as such failed items exist, that may not run together.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B does not have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a folder and B): error: contradictory data types. as long as such failed items exist, that may not run together.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to synchronize is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option catalogues is active. then chose & kdiff3; the necessary action to be identical to both folders. if you have an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but are not identical: together, and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as the visible data name for the output file only B; right after the assembled step & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are assembled and using the option of new file taking place (unsure), then examine & kdiffuse; files are different, but the exact date is identical, but the exact date is identical.. Solange such errors are not eliminated, that can not run the folder of the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While together, a file will work after another. she Status-column shows up Fertig, if it worked together successfully, and according to other reports, when something unforeseen occurs, you should make a final review and see if the status is right in order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When in the setting dialog the file-comparative method is selected, Kdiff3 more columns will display. these contain the number unresolved, soldered, not whiter and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or combined.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the just selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at a time. if you have selected all of the clown actions (even in all subfolders), you can execute it together.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Note: if you have not specified any target folder, then it will be used as a target in the three-folder mode C as the goal, using the two-folder-together B as the goal and will be used for synchronize A and / or B as a destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check back to see if all the entries are displayed in the target folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options to be skipped through the particular entries. check these options to avoid unnecessary surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To perform all the entries: select directory-compiled / continue in the directory -menu or press F7 (the shortcut), select the current element of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If by conflicting data types still exist invalid actions, a message appears on the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialogue window will be released with the options, simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Simply dial if you would like to see what would happen without the really changes done. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiffuse; then leads certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is needed (merge a single file) then it will open a combined window (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are ready with a file, select again directory / continue or press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialogue will appear. then it leads to the next item.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; to make a mistake that appears a message and detailed state-information. at the end of the list you'll see some error messages to help you choose the cause of the problem or to skip the problematic entry. this way, you have the option to choose another action for the entry or to resolve the problem before you continue with.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were made individually, you notice & kdiff3; these comments (in the current session) and leads them together later, those entries are not stored or stored, these entries are considered settled. only when you change the together action, these entries are once again summoned together.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings-menu from & kdiff3; (menu settings - &gt; Kdiff3 setup...) now has a section called directory clapping with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files, which are indicated on the indicated pattern, are displayed in the elementary tree. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid space-card: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folder must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folder that match this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree. it can be added more than one pattern using the semicolon; as separator. valid space-card: '*' and '?'. preset is * .orig. * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folder that match this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree. it can be added more than one pattern using the semicolon; as separator. valid space-card: '*' and '?'. preset is * .orig. * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are also ignored by CVS. many autatic generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be adjusted to a .cvsignage file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems files a Verlies -attribute. in other filesystems have a preceding point. a file is hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the subtree or not. this option is enabled in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">With links to files: when the option is off, symbolic links are compared. when the option is switched, the files are compared to which the links will show. this is disabled in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When links to folder: when the option is off, the links are compared. if the option is switched, the links will be treated like normal folder and removable links. a link to a folder of a link to itself would lead to a final grinding and & kdiffuse;) This option is in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Introduces a complete analysis of each file and shows the statistics columns. (the number of solved, unsolved, non-whiter and whitening conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binding analysis, and much slower if they are applied to files which do not contain any text.</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare big folder over a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change of change and the file size. however, this velocity of speed is necessary to use caution. please use this option in preference.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to Trust the release date. there is no real comparison instead. the files will be identical as identical if they are identical. that can be useful when copying the amendments set. please use caution. this option is unfolded in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronize mode when two folders are compared and no target folder shown. in this mode, the proposals for together will be selected so that both the files are identical. also, the results of composite files are stored in both folders. this option is in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file is proposed as action. (this is considered uncertain because it is provided that the other file is not also changed. you should check this in any case.) This option is in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a folder is replaced by another or deleted, then the original version is renamed and receives the extension .original .When an old backup file with the .orc extension already exists, so it will be deleted without further backup. this also concerns normal combined files, not just the composite folder. this option is switched in the default file.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Usually, the folder-level view remains visible to create individual files; you can switch the window cleiler with the mouse. if you do not want, you can switch the option directory & text window untouched in the window menu and switch between the two views on a change between directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file just by double-clicking on. nevertheless, you can also create a corresponding menu item. you can also run a single file directly without the folder menu. once you save the result, the status will be put forward and the file will not run once again when you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status however is lost if you read the directory again: directory -menu: new read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports networking with the help of KIO-slaves. Kdiffuser uses this for reading files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folder to the opening that are on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file to a ftp-server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed wine archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things should you consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be mashed. (# - &gt;% 23, vacyl- &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file called / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes through the used protocol. it follows a brief list of constraints:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it may not be distinguished as a link indicates a file or a folder. then, a file is accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit authorization or modification of modification. therefore, the entitlements or the modification of change from the original. (do not notice the option familiar to the size.) (This is only possible in local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main reference purpose is currently as differences-viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop first always start the built-in differences-viewers. in order to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences-viewer and then select in Kdiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually, we need & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, when it is considered as a chpart, it takes up a patch file in the Unified format. then decreases & kdiff3; the names of original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then starts & kdiff3; the program patch running to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In Konqueror you can click on a patch file and click from the context menu Preview in - Kdiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files since the creation of the patch file have changed.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the same of two files, a very small toolbar, and menu. that leads or the equals of folders is not supported in the Kpart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiffuse (now, it is already. furthermore, the name KCAT3 already indicates that it can bring together as the program diffuse 3 from the Diff-Tool-Collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I am using GPL-programs already very long and have learned a lot by going into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone on or go through it.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure script not the right prefix to KDE. in the default configuration parameter in / usr / local, but then KDE can not find the resources for user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find further information on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white signs is different, these lines will appear to be identical as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line will be considered not identical. if similar lines add next to each other, this is the but this one is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will remember any difference in the files where he begins and where it ends. that's necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is simply saved as a text file and it is a lot of effort to create an own file format which could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was so far too big. you can recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C. to convert bigger amounts of text should be used to be another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; no src linnen; published and the text cannot be clear. what does this mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; already uses many colors to differentiate of difference. even more highlighting would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and crowds come from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiffuse; use, need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how you can use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of last changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or the file Changelog in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">In order to compile and install on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use following command at the base folder of & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">As & kdiff3; autoconf and automobake, you should not have any problems in compiling. should, however, difficulties occur, please report on the & kde; -mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or switching stages) copies the marked text. inserting (Ctrl-V or switching) adds the text from the clipboard at the current Curing position or replaces the current markings.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences display: files that are identical in all folders are not in the folder structure, and consequently not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you will need to refresh changes to those options the folder with the function Refresh.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries shown to display the differences. that also results that identical files are not copied into the target folder. if the target folder these files does not already contain, they are missing according to the target. (the behavior will be switched in a later program version probably.) This option is in the default version.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source with the labeling A, B and C below the menu bar. if you have attached to one of the buttons, the lines will be attached to the bottom of the selected group at the end of the selected group (if the lines are already present), they will be removed in clicking on the button accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In preference, this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager shows a miniature show of all virtual desktops. it is fairly handy to see the ongoing programs on the labour market to change their size, to end them or move it. this works both within a working area and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications in it. applications can be selected and even move on the desktop and the other.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within a shelf; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on: if on the empty background of & kpager; couplating the context menu, the context menu and the name of the application as well as the entries minimise, maximize, On workspace and finishing. the commands also make the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. appears only if I clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. appears only, when a application was clicked.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this approach marks, the window within the bed can be moved, with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in & kpager, the names of virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cruising this field leaves the & kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if its name is indicated, together with name, the names will be provided with Ordinalfigures, & eg; 1.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crucified, the background of each desktop is also shown as a background in a set-up base.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the running programs are displayed as a small window in the & kpager; otherwise, only the empty employment areas will be shown to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here, the view of the program window is selected. simple features simple right-corner with the proportions of the program window. symbol shows the window with its default symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here, the arrangement of the & kpager; -main window will be determined: classically, & kpager; in a 2xn grid, appear like Pager applications in some other Windowmanagers; waagrees shows all virtual desktops in a horizontal and vertical in a vertical series that is very good for the representation of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to pager-miniature program in the control bar. it has the advantage that he will be able to display and postpone the windows as symbols or with their content. furthermore, it works outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right click on the right button of the mouse within the mouse; and subsequent selection of switches... makes the dialog settings appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment, this cannot be changed in dialog settings. but you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc using any text editor like e.g. & kedit; or, if you do not have a despatch for the file, you need to register as user root or login to your system administrator. in this file you need to assign the key windowTransparent mode and to give it a value. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click, as soon as the mouse-cursor is tempted for a while on the same point. it is meant to help people who suffer the repadditive penal-jury (RSI) and those of every mouse-click sorrow. additionally, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain, who arises in the click of the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also suffer from pain, which are connected with the use of your computer, you should seek a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To put it yet again: even if & kmousetool, you can avoid pain, which is caused by clicking with the mouse, it is against pain caused by the defect of the mouse, useless. and as with all the ergonomic aids applies: the result can be dropped each different.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitoring your mouse movements and takes a mouse click once you break the movement short.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the smart step activates, makes & kmousetool; a break after it has stimulated the squeeze of the mouse button. in this way you can run the pulling of the mouse button. in this way you can run the pulling upon a heavy mouse button. in this way, you can push the pulling a little practice, but you get used quickly from it.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This buckwheat must be petrified after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a single mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Is smarter delocates, the screaming lapse (1 / 10 s) is active. here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after the downward of the mouse is waiting, if the mouse happens no questioning of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now, this feature goes by clicking on the right and back, followed by a break, a click with right mouse button. a slow road is saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes .txt. the first time will be started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound appears delayed, you can decrease and shorten the reaction times. to this, you choose sound & multimedia, select the sound system and here the rider General. there is a sliders sound buffer that you adjust to a lower value to shorten the answer.</seg>

<seg id="2508">Setting all the settings back to the values used while opening the dialogue. have you already pushed the button, the settings will be reset based on the last dolls of the dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the presets. in particular, the smart move should you first off off. if you then got accustomed to the automatic mouse, you can later make the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">When you use the audible click, it may be necessary to decrease the answer issues of & kde; at sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse-click without effect remains: the click on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that does not pose a link, does not lead to unclaiming reactions. you can therefore leave the mouse in such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse crates, you should clean your mouse. it's usually fairly simple. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse gel, but also the roles that come with the mouse ball in touch.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to find the mouse ball. as that happens, from mouse to mouse, it should be clear when you view the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you need to see the roles. these are on the sides of the hole, into which the ball was used. the dirt and the dirt drain you easily with a flat blade or the fat scratching bag.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system collapsing the execution of & kmousetool; if you just use a failure to move, it means that & kmousetool; the operation is no longer able to finish the mouse by leaving the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; under a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem consists of you yourself run a mouse click. this will be the status of & kmousetool; return and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another passage.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it. however, a different click on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to generate a keyring area. safe zones for the mouse buttons are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the titles of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligence, but I don't manage to edit the text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart moving is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can deal with it. it is very easy to copy and paste it into the clipboard or insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse upon a pressing mouse button. but, some advice is to help:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Use the smart moving not only when you just start using it's start & kmousetool; to use it. instead, you decide at the end of the text area a mouse click and hold the switching button down, while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and move it again with the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this time gets a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when doing the moving time it starts. later, you can use the smart step also without the audible mouse click. but, it requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; to use, the XTest extensions can be installed for & X Window. this should be the case on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker, and are set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; pressing the mouse-mouse as soon as the mouse-cursor is short perched. this program was developed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome and those of the defender of the Moblasts.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts;. for normal work with & ktts; are filters not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filtering, text is edited, before it is sent to the Speech Dispatcher program. they are useful for enhancing the pronunciation to replace false language and abbreviations or to choose a suitable language and speaker or to handle certain shortcomings of language synthetic designs and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the program "Speech Dispatcher" works with a text. sets four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is withdrawn from all other orders and keeps these orders. if the edition of the screen readers are read, the orders will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is becoming hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these jobs will be continued after the release of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the nearest priority. a message underbreaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application, the news is used. while you want to read a long text on a website, you can write with a mouth. & kde; alerts are also messages. read on this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple textbook entrees. every order you encounter orders from cardboard card is a textbook. KSayit is an example of a applications requiring texts. text calls are intended for output longer texts that have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders are processed in queues, except the issue of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen readers, as & ktts; just such a prereading, this edition will be halted and ended.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen readers. you will be applied to normal warnings, messages and text items as well as on & kde; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and enter it on the next filters. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future, there can be even more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Drawing departs replace parts of a text by other text. the pieces of parts can specify either as words or as regular expressions. it is possible with predefined chartering orders: -) by text or for the diformatting of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -reformer use an XSLT-File (XML; Style Language - Transforms) around & XML; from a format to convert into another format. included in the scope of delivery of & XHTML; are included in SSML from a format.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker-selection filter, you can send orders on the content of the text or dependent on the program, which sent the text to & ktts; sent to a spokesman. if you have set the text on map for a female voice, you can let text read by KDE news about it. Siehe. in read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied for voice settings. if the filter is certain that its rules are not correct, it returns the text unchanged at the next filters.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text message, a message, warning or a & kde; -notifications to & ktts; sent, it is edited by all the activated filter on the page. the processing by the filter is done in the order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of furnished ordinary filters. is a filter not crossed, it is not enabled and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter here. select the type of filters and it will be shown below the below servers.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the installation of fonts, you must enter a list of words or regular expressions. these patterns will be found in the text, then the text is exchanged against the associated spare parts. large and small-mail is compared to the comparison.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Type your filter a name for your filter. this name can choose any number, it must differ only from the name of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the string labels in the column, and replace it in accordance with the string of the column. the list is processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to postpone the distinctive word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save the current list or simply download a list of a file, the entries are attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Here is a language registered, the filter is only used when the speaker for the user order is one of the languages available here. click on the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you click on mouse click the & Ctrl; -key pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered, the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separated by comma. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application-ID run programs get you with the program qdbus;. the & Dbus; -Numbers must be weed. if for example, qdbus; the application ID Kopete-3432 indicates, you can only type copy.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string translation filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the chest Diversity region when match. are all input fields empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When compared to words the string-generation filter parameters use in the form\\ s word\\. these words must therefore be limited by separator (blanks).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & kde; -Editor & # 160; controls, you can call it in the dialogs of addition, or work as help to pooling these expressions. controls & # 160; for & # 160; expressions & # 160; expressions can be found in the package of ambigtils.</seg>

<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc is accessible via the environment variable PATH, also ranges xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the Speaker filter, you can send texts to a particular speaker, who is furnished on cardboard card, or to a spokesman with specific properties. you can for example set out that texts should be read by kmail from a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; a text handed over to the filter, it looks for a spokesman for the text. the narrator will be chosen by speaker properties that sends the text to & ktts; sends the text according to the speaker card narrator. with the Speaker filter, you can rewrite the elected speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Here is a value entered, the filter is used in case the text contains the ingiven regular expression. is installed on your system of & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; controls, you can use this with a click on the button to get help with input.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve a faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, d. h., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the properties of your desired thread. if the text meets the above filtering conditions, the speaker is selected to view the desired requirements. click on the button-right to view the dialog selection.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to store or load your spokesperson or to delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The Speaker filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Desen filter if applicable. you need to register at least one condition.</seg>

<seg id="2676">The list of the above languages can be incomplete or obsolete. therefore, you draw the description of synthesizer to the supported languages at rate. look also on the website of ktts;, according to information that are not included in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The "Speech Dispatcher," uses a adaptable module-architecture for linguistic synthesizer. if you want to expand & ktts; for making use of another synthesizer, get in touch with the development team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The program xsltproc is used for support for SSML and for the & XML; it is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the command apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile & kton; compile, you need a current development environment from KDE (Version 3.4 or later) including the packages, for the program called "Speech Dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you move the source code of & ktts; from the source textarchive for purchases or which you have downloaded the tarball, you can download and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use & kton; use, check first if spiny Dispatrons is properly working with your language synthesizer. to do this, you can use the shell scripts (SPD).</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktis; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; that is the Speech Dispatcher program, the program for Speech Dispatcher is to be developed, so that the establishment of Speech Dispatcher is directly possible and the script above is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is disassembled in individual sentences. the user can refrain from typing or baritise, repeating the output or break down.</seg>
<seg id="2684">When an application declares text to & ktts; therefore, it may indicate the properties of the preferred microphone for the output. so, if you have appointed a narrator, whose language English and its gender is female, it will automatically be the most suitable speaker. if you want to know more about how & ktis; a spokesman choose, see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">When you click on map Editions to add them, and therefore click a spokesperson on the list or on Edit, the card-card speaker is displayed. for example, the installation of the module for Interactive is shown. details of the modules can be found under.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable Festivalprogramm. if the path is contained at Festival in PATH, you just need to enter.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text, which is handed to the festival. if voices, the & ktts; are known, this setting is automatically set. generally, that Western languages ISO 8859-1 use, eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders, you place volume, microphone velocity and toning of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some regulator and display this grey, the voice you have chosen does not make these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Several voices such as multi-syn voices need to be loaded on due to their size for several seconds. if you mark this approach, these voices will already be loaded at the start of KTTSD, so that (with a maximum memory consumption), the first sentence is synthesized.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this approach can not be selected, you have not yet to be appointed spokesperson (or forget about it).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this approach marks, it is displayed at the start of kttsmaking the program window, but not the program window visible, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this approach marks and kttsmgr is still not, it appears in the system area, as soon as KTTSD appears to read a text. this means you have the possibility to stop reading or controlled otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here are all orders in queue, together with the application which has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sets and the straight upworked set. the spokesperson ID matches the column ID on the card card narrator.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this series you can slice in the order that is selected in the list below, or go back. (but not every order consists of several sets).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With a click on OK, all changes of settings (also adopted on the other card maps) and kttsmgr added to the icon in the system section. then click on this icon to display the program window again.</seg>

<seg id="2703">On this map, you can set up special actions that will always be executed when the text message is interrupted by a message with higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of language orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is withdrawn from all other orders and keeps these orders. after the edition of Screen reader has been read, the orders will be recorded.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have priority the next-next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is becoming hot. a warning holds the output of messages and normal text. these orders will be continued after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Messages have the next priority. a message underbreaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks news. if you want to read a long text on a website, you can talk to & kmouth; still someone welcome the room straight.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Displays a text message by a message, warning or the output of a screen readers, adds & ktts; the audio-overs in the queue one.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file will always be replayed if a normal text application is interrupted. if both introductory sound and introductory news is active, the introductory sound is eliminated in front of the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card map only apply to normal text copies. for messages, warnings and expenditure of screen readers, there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktts; Knotfy messages, start date, start date and click notifications. the map notification appears.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice of voices, speakers, the volume, the sex of the voice and pitch. also marks for the control of pronunciation from for example abbreviations. SSML is a part of the VoiceXML specification, a further W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the Ra _ diphone voice (british male) since this is the default one, the festival used in the SSML's output.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or toning in the festival configuration dialog do not have 100nbsp;% is set, SSML text is usually very monotonous.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional filters (SDB-Filter). SBDs subdivide the text into individual sentences. thus, you have to synthesize yourself with the entire text application. hence, you can also jump on the cardboard card orders - or shrunk and abort, even if the language synthesizer this is not directly supported.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the above-line application filter. when the first start of & ktts; it is automatically set up an arderline application filter. you can change its settings or add additional statutes filter, but will be off.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to try and read the speaker selection. check the Speaker selection once again. place the speaker selection once again, change some properties and consider how to set the selection of the speaker. of course, you have to have set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"" "" "" "then faster with what can be started, since only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text block that can last very long." ""</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then stop or cancel the orders on cardboard card, even if the language synthesizer this function did not support.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal sequence of rules will be automatically set when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched, only removed. change anything at this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Proposing line, compare text with a regular expression for propositional and add a tectator (decimalcode 8) to the statutes have automatically removed from the text. note that the standard constitutionator filter is only allowed from the text.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD-filters are never applied on & kde; -News (kimo), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have extracted the normal typepline filter, you can insert it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On cardboard card, you can revise the speaker settings for the application. the card card is displayed when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the chief on cardboard card). in other words, no spokesperson will be set.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable spokesman, which displays all the properties of a furnished spokesman. if you do not choose the settings of the microphone or edit, select & ktts; that narrative. otherwise select & ktts; the narrator, which corresponds to the originally listing that originally provided.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker features, clicking on one of the selection codes.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select here the properties of the desired spokesperson. if this property does not matter, you give nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Highlight this approach if the property should have priority to other properties. you can also set multiple markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor when the issue is, it is always treated as a priority property. you will often use this property. the only case where you would like to specify the attribute language, if you know that a specific application text is sent in another language than that of the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all properties in the area who corresponds to the above below, click on the optional speaker manufacturer and then use on speakers, which corresponds to the above mentioned below.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 for the last text box is in queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number, the input 0 is required).</seg>

<seg id="2798">This guide explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & control center; that enables the administration of the network interface, routing and DNA settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kystcenter; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings, via a uniform, integrated user interface. it can be viewed by selecting K Menu kControllers.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way, like other settings from the & spa post; create the areas of & knetworkconf; for the user, create a simple interface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After the installation, a new module network set in & kcontrolcenter; shown here. the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by choosing kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in & kmenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware can not install. physical devices and their drivers have already to be able installed and configured, so that & knetworkconf; the device is at all executing and setting the setting of the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed at the install of & Linux; installed and installed. networked devices later, the drivers will need to be loaded by adjustment of the following files, according to the core version, be loaded:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module network settings is loaded when the option network changes in & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. when starting the module network, this, the platform used on the system automatically detect automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform can not be recognized, the suspension latch is offered. it is the platform to choose from the list that is best suited to the distribution and the release points. by flagging the setting non-once again, the setting may be made permanently. at the next start of the network settings, then this selection will be automatically expedited.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the setting settings is only possible in system administration mode. previously, all options are gray shown, what means the settings may only be considered, changement is not possible. in the system administration mode, you can switch to the right lower end of the module. it is necessary to input the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system-system mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The rider network interface serves to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from the rider network interface, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The Settingsgated network interface can be arranged by selecting the desired device in the list and instructions of the button interface... in the dialog device should be edited.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the button below shows the dialog with further possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection Automatically, TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. the DHCP- or BOOTP server will be required at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP- or BOOTP server can be required either. in the selection list may be either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system selected.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection manual can be set without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration. in the input field IP-address must be specified the desired TCP / IP address. in the input field network mask is the SubNetwork.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is marked, the system initializes the interface between the boats. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values given in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be assured that the IP address in the network will not already be used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console; you can determine if the requested address is already in use. in doubt, the administrator should be asked.</seg>

<seg id="2820">A machine with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers may only be able to understand IP addresses. if the computer http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS comes to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator for attribution part of the equestrian center allows for easy handling of this list. entries can be added, removed or modified .DNS entries can be arranged through selection of a sign and up or down-classification in the list with the buttons, or floating in the priority.</seg>

<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetwork.sourceforge.net you can download the latest version of the source.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of the binary distributions (usually rpm-packages) is sufficient when & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm multi-package and in a & konsole; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with a graphically surface like a package or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & Co. not, it does not require the development planning with libraries and other libraries.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This will only be recommended for experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; however, the following commands should do so.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given to basic networks, in the second part all of & knetworkconf; altered configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not substitute any knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of PCs into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Current IP networks with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4) is operated. IPv5 has never found large distribution. IPv6 is expected that it is in the near future. this description is therefore concentrated on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP-address of a network interface is assert. in foreign networks, at & eg; workstation is the contact persons serving the contact point, which may be a valid IP address, or if available, DHCP is not easy to use. in any case, the IP address can not be chosen arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specially for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded in the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines through setting an gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, there are usually addresses in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is big enough for networks to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route that leads the loopback address (localhost = of your own computer). the default route is required for IP redirects.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local press. usually, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files are stored by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file will sometimes change dynamically to DSL connection, so that it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections, you can find other content than specified there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file will be sorted by the script in SuSEconfig. another level as expected may happen.</seg>

<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you have to select the backup files that can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or a folder in the local file tree. it is saved only this file or a folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Flag files in a local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select them in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been introduced, the dialog settings for backup. in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you have confirmed the settings, dialogue will appear. dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the rate of data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Flag a file or folder in one of the files in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder is checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Flag the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick. only the marked files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right in any of the archives, click on one of the archives and select the "menu" menu.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the verification process has been started, the dialog settings will be checking for checking in this dialog, you can still review your selection and change the working folder for the review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the review, the dialogue will be reexamined. this dialog shows the progress of the audit plan as well as data throughput and the constant time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you establish the reproduce, the files needed to be restored, this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives, which belong to the ticket for the bandmodel. it is restored only the selected file or the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Flag the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and choose from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been launched, the dialog settings for restoration. in this dialog you can still review your selection and change the working folder for restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"" "" "" "if you have confirmed the settings for the restoration, the dialogue will re-establish." "" "this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as data throughput, and the constant time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to regenerate the bandthreadfile with the bandcontent. this process clears all the existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">Through this, a backup profile will be created with the indicated data and the standard settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should be carried out; the list of rescent files will be automatically updated according to the currently selected work system.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders, which are listed under fbackup files, is that only the files are stored in the same filesystem, such as the folder. folder that are available on other filesystems. each entry is tar independently of the other files.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files changed since the final incremental backup, a snapshot file will only be backed up. only the files are stored, which have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to establish changes since the final incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes all files to be backed and a new snapshot file for the next backup will be created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files is gt; and lt; files was not yet implemented at the time of creation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings at your menu item Cow... in the Settings Settings You can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the machine file for the bandwidth (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-reproduce -variant of the bandwidth.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this attitude is active, transmitted and dat. before the band is included the command flow to the drive. with some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing assignments can be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched, tries & cold; to lock the way to the bandwagon. possibly this setting does not work with all bandwagon.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched, when solving the integration of & kdat; automatically the tape is automatically rejected. use this option not for floppy Streaming.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched, tries & cold; the hardships will support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you have to communicate & dat; in any case the block size to your bandmodel is disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & dat; a band is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the belt. this file should only occupy a disk block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this character string is bname: seconds, the bname of the full name of the system is formatted to which the band is formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the epoch where the band is formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the directory $HOME / .kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives, who run directly with the GNU; - tar do not work. even other tar -versions should work, as long as it does not deal with incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup banger. this symbol is only active if a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; -viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can't know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files. furthermore, allows users to provide quick access to information about problems linked to their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksexpresslog; helps users understand what your computer power is in the background. the program is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can not know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system is stored in the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, allows & ksmiclog; experienced users access to information about problems linked to their server. therefore tries to provide some more advanced functions, with whose help the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful features. among other things, include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included in addition and will be explained in the subsequent chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot, displays & ksystemlog; functions available, with whose help the single protocol-lines of a protocol file is easy to filter and sort. the individual options to sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & Co-op log; first, the most important protocol-file of the system - the system protector will not be displayed, and it opens up instead of being a small label window, so you will have not started using Systemverwalkright. the protocol files typically find themselves under Linux normally in the folder / var / log, for the normal user normally no justification for reading.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter out after a chosen criterion or upon a given string player. then, select a log line next to the filter slot. then, a protocol line contains only displayed, if in one of the columns, the string of the filter is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. select the character string protocol only with the entries in the selected column. select the name of a process in accordance with the filter file, so clearly shows you & kswith log; all the protocol lines which have been sent or produced by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. record-lines of stage error will be shown with a showdown color as protocol-lines of step instructions. the color-line presentation of protocol lines can be switched on-setting dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain process (for example in the system protocol or on cron protocol), you can use the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the launch of the samba server. in this case, use filename.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump the option to new lines posted in the context menu of the main window, to display all the new images-lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksexpresslog; allows display of multiple protocol files in separate sub-directories. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open additional subwindow and manage. once you have selected a window, select a protocol for display from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksexpresslog; does an own website on http: / / ksmicrology. forum-software.org. You can find more recent information on the sources of sources of & ksmiclog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksexpresslog; see also in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksmiclog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv;. this section guides a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V init quickly developed to the standard for controlling the program starts at the top of the system in the & Linux; and therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful and simultaneously more flexible than the traditional BSD Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further in historical aspects here (e.g. because I know nothing about myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important, because maybe someone might try to frame a machine to System V init without a reinstall and re-format. therefore, you need to ensure that the old init was removed from there, if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV init also differs from the BSD init that is the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.d. this is called rc.sysinit and the following further folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. in principle, you need a script for any system service, which you would like to start at the top of the system or when switching to another running level. system services involve not such things such as setcures that will be started only once. such views are according to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should turn on / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems do not own this file, even though it actually does not have much use for this. you can also want to run a rc.slate in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks for different places after the program init and starts the first to find it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should start a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably note that the preset running is 3 is. if you want to change it, you can perform / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have got a break, then you come up it by restart the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you fill -l in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there is no right files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stops init actually system services? simply: each of the scripts is written so that it is an argument as start and stop accepting. you can actually start this script from hand to the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one includes, the script will be called along with the argument stop. if he included an S, the script will start with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; an server-running level, which leaves the only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. additionally, I could also have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; start.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv;. it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another index device is simple to not say, you simply drag an entry from the available system services to one of the six rounds of system to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move it between Runleveln or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. thereby, the entry will be removed from its original Runlevel (or its position), and then does not happen if they extract an entry from the area of the disposable system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are delayed when you move them into a new area. to simply select them from the menu or select from the context menu, and paste the target area, even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The Sortivorrow of an item can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you will need to edit the collision of the surrounding entries, before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no way to restore entries that were thrown in the trash. be, so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to enable the different workspaces (disposable system services, Runlevel 1 start, Runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor buttons, to meet a selection or below the past.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another runway, move it with cutting off to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel by inserting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the type or name of an item manually, press the input button to open the Properties dialog. use the tabulator button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to shed the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss you require all entries in the menu file a confirmation before it is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they are saved by & ksysv; restored. changes to the presets are saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveln and now the machine starts unstable. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard Runlevel at a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services provided with & ksysv; for running on Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), then you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way to start system services in these distributions are simplified, but unfortunately not a standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution: please check if all configuration files are available from the respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just quit without notice if their configuration files are not available or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; running from distribution to distribution, may even vary from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information on the running level so that this manual is inflicted.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refer to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it's enough to read the chapters adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you have made changes, you need to store this. either use the appropriate icon of the toolbar, or the entry saliva in the file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is an easy application. the main window comprises two card cards, the user interface and the user listing. for example, select the desired users or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it appears on the dialog box or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some map maps are only shown if you have advanced system settings. only if you have space restrictions (Quota) for users, a cardboard card will be produced, in case of shadow passcodes or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD unix devices are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2994">Map version Passwortverwaltung appears in case shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD networks.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This map only appears if needed for at least an built-in filesystem path (Quota) and initializing (recognizable on the file quotas user / quota.group on the filesystem). here you can change parameters for each user, with the limited constraint in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for any filesystem. the current file system is chosen with the help of the field file system with space constraint.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Map groups informs about group members of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, you will find in the field of primary group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by using them in the great field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog features of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select Add from the menu user or group or click on the matching Add button. the operator or deleting the selected user or the selected group is analog.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO-System, remove the boot-password, remove and change the time until the boats of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, change operating systems, modify, change and more.</seg>
