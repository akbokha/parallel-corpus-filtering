although I had visited the US for at least once a year , I would go there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely big .
as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I have anced with American music , American writers read and run its sport .
indeed , this country had such a pro@@ found@@ ly effect on me , that I was mainly done because of a American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am at The Pel@@ ican Brief , who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspir@@ acy of a oil Magn@@ um who were the Supreme Court of judges who were s@@ nat@@ ched his interest .
I was caught .
free to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; It was it , as if that is the absolute truth , do everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the US .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming , that you can always be the one you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I had even written a very nice way of love about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump .
much was written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most remarkable aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me , as he is dealing with his bot@@ t@@ iness .
he never ends with his opinion behind the mountain , as it says so beautiful .
he says what he thinks , how a former colleague put it , and declar@@ es publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ ino , Af@@ ro@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans and women .
nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes that he won in the Republi@@ can presidential elections , was the highest number given by the party of nomin@@ ate Candi@@ date .
I was sp@@ ell@@ bound .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I could not fix Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist program , which takes people from all over the world , a deep believing man , with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also opposed tr@@ umps of world@@ view , not by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours with the &quot; Phoenix One &quot; playing in the game .
toler@@ ances of intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity that I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr who fought for her life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es who always with lots of patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise couns@@ elling me helped me much with my career .
these people and those made by them em@@ bodi@@ ment my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump becomes his way to nomin@@ ee Republi@@ can presidential election , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , most of the White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the discussion with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , I broke almost the heart .
maybe it &apos;s unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters as a rac@@ ist .
the people assigned , told one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superf@@ icial and respectful and indicates a lack of ability to understand the ones that act in a different way and think .
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the p@@ ect@@ onic changes in their communities are not considered .
could it be that these voters , of which the most white are , for Tr@@ ump , because they would like to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed me ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in the United States ?
maybe .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comments the cru@@ el decision to rise a man who look with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ .@@ d. SC ) : as much as &quot; u@@ drawing of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ as &quot; ; wording of white in alignment of the wh@@ ites and wh@@ i@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) as it was called the big Van Jones , has exactly killed what America has done so magnificent .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it &apos;s nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background you like , America is always welcome .
for this country , as its president , twice the Son of a Ken@@ ian@@ ki , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
but with the choice of Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of the white Americas on this promise , saying , The hell of plur@@ alism , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again on the rod , say it .
with all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who died in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton had Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the quantity she rep@@ lied with a voc@@ al &apos; No ! &apos;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ cked the crowd .
&quot; have Lat@@ ino a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answer them .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she and her voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a mon@@ oph@@ onic and vo@@ ci@@ ful &apos; NE@@ IN . &quot;
Mr. Khan ended with words : &quot; God be praised that Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is now tr@@ umps country , she said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find any place in this new America .
and that leaves me my heart .

that the music , which is played in both places , not just the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located at the edge of a great gar@@ bage dump , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among the tourists , but the worlds origin@@ ating from the nearby semi @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for several years now the La B@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( musi@@ ban@@ de ) has now been playing in the community : one out of children and adults in the existing Symphony Orchestra , which with their music instruments an opportunity to overcome them surrounding poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the church of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English Zeitung The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mex@@ ik@@ os , is known for its drugs abuse and bonds .
but this changed after an acci@@ dental encounter with a French pilots who started a musical project and the youth provided a rare hope .
the young band members take their obligations to the Musik@@ gruppe very seriously , says the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
once they come out of school , they run back home and immediately running after lunch they run by the dust streets to meet their great passion .
they always come l@@ ach@@ end and playing with sh@@ iny eyes and play in the vort@@ ex you learn to play day after day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , ob@@ oe , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from Mül@@ l
more than 7,@@ 000 kilometers south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that lies practically at the top of the greatest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments produced from re @-@ value waste material :
music with re @-@ prepared instruments , made from local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for Musik@@ instrumente in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where rec@@ ycl@@ er began to turn part of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez in order to convert parts of the waste in instruments .
instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , double @-@ bass , guitar , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all of which were produced from the gar@@ bage .
the re@@ pertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article in Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local ec@@ ologist and Musi@@ cians apprenti@@ ces the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , to the initial time :
first it was very difficult because we had no space to rehear@@ se and we had to work in the same place where parents worked in the gar@@ bage , the kids had no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : one out of waste was in violin .
today there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments from rec@@ er@@ ated material and which is called The Rec@@ ycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) is characterized by the musical performance on :

and here they turn him into something beautiful .

these East African countries are demonstr@@ ating how technology and team work can successfully fight against illegal fishing
photo © FISH @-@ i Africa - a project that makes the wild fishing fighting .
this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports international , practiced solutions for environmental problems reported .
re @-@ release is done as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices on the common usage of content .
in West Africa , this ship was already known that this ship was already operated in liberal and illegal fishing , before it looked towards the other coast of Africa .
the east African countries were therefore up@@ lifted and little incl@@ ined to welcome a legislative re@@ aker of this kind on their shores .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ors , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ised quickly against the ship . they refuse to go one of its har@@ b@@ ours and so@@ aked himself to give him a fisher@@ man permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply remember everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leit@@ ender of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ man Authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship was discovered and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
2013 , the ship was then driven from the waters of the region : it was not succeeded to catch fish there .
ultimately , it was also comp@@ elled to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia because of pill@@ age the land stocks .
the core of this initiative , the criminal practices crossed and resources protects , was FISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries who had driven the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and stand on each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the Ren@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts project ending illegal fishing . this project provides a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dream @-@ i Technical Support &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is im@@ pris@@ oned , is secret , due to it extremely difficult to feed . there@@ with , illegal fishing is a leading cause of the over@@ fishing of regions .
through the deliber@@ ate cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems may harm that a del@@ ici@@ ates balance .
however , while taking action against illegal fishing , once were ham@@ pered by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ dles and also through the sn@@ ail , with the information between individual countries , the actions made today in real time , with trac@@ eable on FISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries can interact with each other for example lists existing licenses , news about suspected activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a harbor site .
Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea , via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to mark ships who fish in forbidden areas - such as double @-@ lines travel - such that point out that a ship invites its captured fish on the road to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence , where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal off@@ ense .
countries , which are against illegal fishing , can then refuse the assumption of such ships in their ports . what means that ships can not sell their charge . and that they might even be forced to pay for pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it is a considerable financial loss for the owner , meaning that the illegal fish@@ y decre@@ ases financial anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , leit@@ ender director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that supports himself in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports a FISH @-@ supporting .
a closed front
the aforementioned platform was created to attract valued 20 million USD in lost sales , which will lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to the illegal fishermen who penet@@ rate the East African waters .
East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing vessels which attracts the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also those illegal fishermen .
among which practices include actions such as the Seg@@ eln under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit licence papers , indication of fant@@ asi@@ en@@ ames , the fish @-@ protected species and the fish@@ ings in nature areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they targeted the lack of international co @-@ operation and make the weaknesses of a non @-@ established control system &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before a ship could illegal fishing and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You dar@@ ing to do my port &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Com@@ m to me &apos; . and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ ole tries to close a grey @-@ i now .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , Charles @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ects ships .
it has revealed criminal networks to spread counter@@ f@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships who used several fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent ident@@ ities and it has tr@@ acked fo@@ sters ships and found .
thanks to its collaboration with Inter@@ pol , the international authority to combat crimes , the international authority can share information on illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the organized crime &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system to help the FISH @-@ dres@@ ser , dil@@ uted ships to be precise .
photo with friendly permission of FISH @-@ i Africa .
Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , helps the illegal vessels to make you hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide its activities and position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Princip@@ analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g Mat Tr@@ acking , an NGO , which also deals with fish@@ eries data and FISH @-@ i technical support .
some of the ships are turning on for example their automatic Identi@@ fication systems , with which they can no longer be loaded by satellites .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system which connects various information levels with one another . it aims to help a lot more collabor@@ ating ships with greater precision .
a model program
but , a patient @-@ i &apos;s team can actually influence Africa &apos;s team influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO sky@@ Truth , believes that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth will open the Platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data , and through which the position of each individual vessel can be displayed worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it con@@ ven@@ es with the neighbors to get a better picture of who what where doing - this gives easy sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to uni@@ fy themselves and combine their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project to run in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that FISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only crimin@@ als but they also cr@@ inge .
ships who had used to reck@@ on without a license and hardly expected to reck@@ oned with consequences , they now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in the Berlin @-@ i @-@ participating countries took a 33 % increase of fish@@ eries fund , since fishing boats more licenses purchased .
after FISH @-@ i Somalia , Gre@@ ko was refu@@ te , Gre@@ ko 1 found the inspec@@ tors there on board Schle@@ pp@@ ets which is prohibited .
photo with friendly permission of FISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries also notice these successes . &quot; the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we are a study object . &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars had disappear by illegal fishing .
in 2015 , six countries joined together to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . also , they fight against illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as a FISH @-@ Level . &quot; with certainty , the goal is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , the recent member state in Somalia could announce their first major tri@@ umph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag at the same time . and not only the ship was used without a license and were used Schle@@ pp@@ ets which are now prohibited .
the ship was also included in the forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; with the take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing tackle , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for FISH @-@ i this is a further success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collabor@@ ative operation works to protect the oceans actually works across the world . Emma Bry@@ ce is an independent journalist and lives in London . there they writes on the subject of environment , technology and nutrition .

the roads in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of severe demonstrations .
it is regarded as a protest against the decision of the Government to stop the referendum on the president of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

the political and economic situation of the country is deteri@@ or@@ ated continuously , resulting in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans caused by a acute lack of food and medicine .
many representatives of the Opposition saw the chances of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance for a fundamental change ; however , ultimately , the deport@@ ation of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .

especially large waves beat the news of polished oppression in the central north @-@ north of Marac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators pulled back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement from the police and armed supporters of the government .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country , some protest@@ ers discovered the police forces , including those women in the An@@ den@@ state of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira carry no red@@ ness , because otherwise there could not be anything that many national gar@@ den@@ sts do not have !
meanwhile , a info@@ graphic render the amount of supp@@ ression per day :
thus the dictatorship of the country has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had question@@ ed the validity of the demand for an am@@ im@@ eter proceedings - this has now been demonstrated in the eyes of many people &apos;s presence on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s about it :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ d@@ ado claim that 1 % of the signat@@ ures are counter@@ f@@ eit .
here is your pay@@ roll !

others regard these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government which have undertaken little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and would rather have engaged critical voices .
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the markets always take more about frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they are hungry to participate in a strike , rather than working or buying .

this is an adapted version of a interview by Ale@@ jo Gó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on August 23 , 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine news page .
the interview was translated into English and will be released with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to join the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentin@@ ian city of Cordoba , part of the present .
now as an adult man said Qui@@ j@@ ano now in the frame of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera passed in the province of Cordoba to his father .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argentin@@ ian military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting at the Bür@@ de , which bears the same name as his father to the brutal m@@ oods in the prison La Per@@ la , he was watching over at the age of 15 .
34 years he considered the sur@@ name of the family .
in the situation at that time , I believed that it was fine .
I felt like an obe@@ di@@ ent .
as a child of 15 years you don &apos;t realize that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ y tri@@ umph@@ s . during the Argentin@@ ian military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was dep@@ uty chief of the Secret Services department , 141 in the prison La Per@@ la .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
fil@@ ing up .
but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor , who has been charged for ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kid@@ n@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and who said before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parent and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went with us in the sports hall . there I had struck me with a lad , who did combat sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him and a couple of days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and challenged me to identify my friend .
he said ,
you are a dick@@ head , you have made yourself with one of the ERP .
pass only that they do not escape one day and I must save you .
the Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revolu@@ tionary ario del Pueb@@ lo , - revolution@@ aries of the revolutionary arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party in Argentina .
that is why he offered me to go back into the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me , I would become sal@@ mon .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . because so my father brought me up .
on the military base , I had to destroy the papers that had heard the pris@@ oner .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , Pro@@ pag@@ and@@ amat@@ eurs , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ As dr@@ ones are tor@@ tured the prisoners &quot;
my father took me a total of four times in La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time , he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he command@@ ed me to ascend . he led me to a bar@@ k , in the cars , furniture , TV , refrigerator , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible - stood .
all of this was stolen .
he gave me a small into a se@@ aling box and command@@ ed me to wear it to the car . when I opened it I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump in silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen objects were question@@ ed and talked with an id@@ post .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I j@@ umped into and sees a couch that were tor@@ tured on the human being .
it looked like a field @-@ bed and a metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that it reached the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person that lay straight there .
they sel@@ dom a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs onto the bed , mas@@ hed him with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals .

the st@@ ank into it was horri@@ ble ... like a nar@@ ro@@ ar win@@ ch .
years later , when my father stood under household rest , the same smell came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately again and gave me clear that the smell of a body in need is .
I have never forgotten this smell .
and I wonder@@ ed : how is it possible for someone to do so much suffering from one another ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed . &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he brought me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were cap@@ tiv@@ ated by hand@@ cu@@ ffs , and were joining up .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked men were cap@@ tiv@@ ated with the face - all were cap@@ tiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
near the entrance , people remain silent on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my Father re@@ marked that I saw the pris@@ oner , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What Are you so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have un@@ advised , Why did you get my ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and killed by soldiers .
I know that because my father told her home .
beside La cu@@ ad@@ ra were some rooms that were referred to as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there put together a man and kill .
( according to information given by survi@@ vor@@ s , the Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , the director of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former folk chambers .
the road that you came in at here is also the way in which the kid@@ n@@ apped came here .
when you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were given a number assigned to the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
if they survived the torture , the prisoners were cast into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be displ@@ aced .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ emis@@ as - for the dis@@ appearance of the people and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war@@ ute &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things to your home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at that time in the age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war@@ ute &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - how they called it - was . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when I was later in the military - I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - was clear to me that war is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs that you have fought one enemy .

but if one walks into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothing , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not a war , but Vand@@ alism .
that is theft .
I always wonder@@ ed how my Father , the director of the security forces , with this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just do not understand it .
I was also officers at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to penet@@ rate into a house and ste@@ al all of it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a criminal , and I said , And thou that you appro@@ ve of the car on the road ?
you are not crimin@@ als ?
he explo@@ ded before W@@ ut , struck me and cr@@ ying :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you independently .
for that we need nobody else !
so was my father .
I have no only good memory of him .
when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of that at that time , on which I had a jacket and truck con@@ voy from Wol@@ le . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
back then I accused the defense of being a co @-@ conspir@@ ing with this crime . I har@@ dened , no problem , they can lay me to the burden what they wanted .
I was anyway there to say .
&apos;@@ The dis@@ appearances of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &apos;
now , where I am getting older , I find Reu@@ e .
I have children . if you first have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and re@@ alis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I went even so far to say :
good , you have gr@@ illed during the dictatorship of people . but why the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children are kid@@ n@@ apped ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother was killed .
it was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked me the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could just put them in prison .
I guess it was just decided to kill these people . but for what their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not be able to pass these people to those who were able to pass their mort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the dis@@ appearances of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act , which one can do to a man .
my father told me when the democracy was introduced again , brought them machinery to eliminate the imm@@ ort@@ ality of the prisoners .
they were conceived and somewhere dispos@@ ed - no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but anything else remains always .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to get it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about twenty crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought , showing my father , was created during a conversation , as he stood under a house ar@@ rest .
I made him endeav@@ or because of all of the gr@@ ills , which I had to experience according to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt internally pulled me and wonder@@ ed what the whole exagger@@ ated Patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; which it was supposed to defended them .
then I cri@@ ed :
how can you tell us what to tell me ?
I saw how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me to participate as a child to participate .
he only prov@@ oked to Na , &quot; Na me . &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
2010 first I first display the first display .
I finally realised that he was a crime .
no one can dict@@ ate to me that I was prop@@ elled . I finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under the house ar@@ rest , even before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : among other severe , un@@ law@@ ful freedom of liberty in 154 cases , murder in 98 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent deaths in five cases and a case of kid@@ n@@ apping of one under 10 @-@ year child .

the jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the cl@@ esi@@ on to the mag@@ nit@@ ude of the verdi@@ ct .
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been witnesses , the historical La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera ended up in August 1975 and December 1978 committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty for crimes against humanity . the Court issued a lifetime subject of adhesi@@ on in 28 cases and in nine cases of adhesi@@ on between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there was freedom aud@@ ited .
eleven of the original 54 accused died during the process .

all accused were members of the dictatorship of the military , including former military @-@ related , former police and civil workers .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes the elderly in Kyoto on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible motor@@ cyclists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the shield with the translation errors at a center in Kyoto , where one can pro@@ long his driver &apos;s licence .
the photo was spread in social media .
execution of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese City of Kyoto , customers were a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long his driver &apos;s reputation , in the last month witnesses of a particularly mis@@ erable translation .
on a shield the Japanese word of loc@@ ates ( codi@@ le sha ) , the &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; means , but perhaps also with mal@@ icious rear @-@ thought and # 82@@ 12 ; are translated as &quot; fri@@ ght@@ ful drivers . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be found on electronic entries from the 1st to 20th of September and to read in the building itself .
processing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in the social media .
the error was the trans@@ lators of Julian Hol@@ mes , an employee of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the places of local people .
the Kyoto daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto , simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the incorrect English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate option if also gram@@ atic not quite correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; el@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) replaced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the pre@@ f@@ ecture Kyoto exc@@ used for the translation errors . furthermore , they explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from transl@@ ator and that the translation has not been tested for correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the alleg@@ ation :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are truly sorry that older people felt by the inadequate correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News put themselves more detailed by the phenomenon of &quot; fri@@ ght@@ ful &quot; older motor@@ ists in Japan apart and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been den@@ oun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older motor@@ ists . according to the police , the proportion of older motor@@ ists who are involved in accidents , but certainly cause for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture Kyoto , for instance , were created in 2005 1.@@ 9@@ 41 by a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents of sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , the sen@@ iors 1,8@@ 03 produced by a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
in this way , its share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the total number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of sen@@ iors caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
the name of the re@@ porter in the published version of the article comments on the light which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese appears to be even against older motor@@ ists :
the article on Yahoo about the translation errors , including the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible motor@@ ist &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
- &quot; This is wrong , the translation is actually not , or ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is common throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and in Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true discovery site for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
to transition , one requires two important skills : passive knowledge , in order to understand the starting text and to active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is the case with speakers . in general , the conviction that trans@@ lators in the target language - should not be in the source language - native language .
thus , a French mother tongue , for example from English to French transl@@ ator - not from French to English .
photo by Flick@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a mother tongue , the translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of superi@@ ority , reasons , or the relatively small number of English speakers , which may learn Japanese .
some companies , who even have no foreign employees , make translations still pe@@ aked internally . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered to be the best of transl@@ ator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Flick@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the conf@@ using and pu@@ zz@@ ling sent@@ ences that emerge through machine translation , show that this technology can still no longer replace a human trans@@ lators for a long time . this also applies to some languages .
some of the rar@@ est English wor@@ dings in Japan , including the mysterious scre@@ en@@ ings which often sm@@ ears T @-@ shirts or po@@ ckets , are used only for sty@@ li@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .

translation errors may be as a jewelry yet acceptable or at least harmless . but by big companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect careful translations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city of Kyoto continues to use a serious source of translation for their translations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Venezuela : protests and c@@ ens@@ ation measures on the internet and television take
main page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ensa y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7th April , reported ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an Internet users , that they would have no access to the online radio station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet pres@@ ences of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
also other online radio broad@@ band &apos;s protests in Car@@ acas , which were organized by acts of opposition groups who oppose the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the protests started in early April after the Court of Parliament resolved the Parliament and had the presi@@ dents of the Parliament on the executive and the chief Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ out@@ it . he pointed out that the connection was k@@ issed and recommended the U@@ sers , V@@ PN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Z@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your V@@ PN .
it seems that Internet sites ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ play@@ Net
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Vene@@ ti@@ ers with internet access , especially in times of distur@@ ban@@ ces .
traditional media have been coverage since 2014 during the reporting of protests . at that time , the Commission asked for telecommunic@@ ations to report about the demonstrations , as the Commission would continue to report about the demonstrations , as the Commission considered this as &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
astonishing that it continues to be cheaper than two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay through a locking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) is in@@ accessible , but also two other on @-@ line transm@@ itter . this also applies to the website , where the National Assembly is carrying out their meetings .
previous research inquiries made by the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique that fails to respond with the DNA information from certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds f@@ law@@ ed or denied the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS locks : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transfer was set on Thursday , April 6 , set when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flores , carried out in cust@@ ody the protests in Car@@ acas .
Flores was be@@ aten while he was police in police .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on broadcast again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government is regulated the Internet connections : in order to allow the Venezu@@ el@@ ans the access to multi@@ medi@@ al coverage of the current events in the country is increasingly difficult .
in Paraguay many girls will ma@@ stered many girls in order to receive education
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was as a child a cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s fighting for the rights of children and colle@@ cts things from other crimin@@ als who have been the victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Cec@@ ilia Ro@@ jas . use with friendly permission of Kur@@ dish .
the following article is the short@@ ened version of a report by the draft which is published by Global Vo@@ ices by courtesy of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; V@@ acas que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ underlying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , which is edited by Global Vo@@ ices of Latin America and published .
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga has lived eight years in a household where she was not with the family who lived there , was allowed to eat .
shortly before she gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house spoke full of pride about she . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have become of something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ enga has never been treated in this house as a daughter .
when she became ten years old , she began to work as a cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , one calls in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the store is quite simple : a big family with little money out of their min@@ der son or her mother &apos;s daughter to another , rich@@ est family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head .
but what is not mentioned , is that children must provide a countless number of days in house@@ work which will never be paid and victims of abuse and mis@@ management - and all this within the framework of an agreement that cannot be up@@ lift .
the practice designated as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widely used in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ enga worked for a few years for an organization working for the rights of the boys and girls .
in doing so , she spoke with cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered stuff , resear@@ ched and p@@ ran@@ ged .
she tried to name things by name because the sense of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ mean itas , guaranteed in general st@@ agn@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is one on the one hand the family that their daughter stir@@ red in faith that they will ex@@ clude their education to improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something from themselves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family is where the girl takes up and whose exploitation is just@@ i@@ fies with faith that there would be someone a chance , who otherwise would not receive training , and maybe even hung@@ ered .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is mis@@ led , his family will only learn how many years later .
sometimes , they even learn of it .
in January 2016 the so far @-@ known phenomenon , that is held in the twi@@ light of par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú came to hospital , her body showed traces of violent g@@ ain@@ saw . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military owned Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who work as officials from the population .
in her house she lived in V@@ aqu@@ ería , a small town with only about 3.000 inhabitants situated 250 kilometres to the east of As@@ unci@@ ón .
end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira broad@@ casts long as long as a stick to Mar@@ ín until they suffered fatal injury .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the ass@@ ass@@ inated child was a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organisations such as UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep @-@ rooted practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they designated the cri@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest and demanded that there is &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows as children , &quot; m@@ our@@ ned Tina Al@@ var@@ enga .
without papers it is much easier to hurt the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of sp@@ ars and almost 60 civil society organizations called for a rapid investigation into the case .
they want to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
the everyday life of a cri@@ ad@@ ita
cri@@ b@@ itas will not only be exploited as labor force , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was ten years old when the farmer who worked her father to sign up and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to all work and began to sell on the road or on the market sweets to earn money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina has been sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ enga worked between four and six hours every day .
at the same time she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
Friday for example puri@@ fying it the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ k@@ fied the floor .
when the school was finished , she went home again and had time for learning .
the more she finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because they had dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ enga says it had never to hungry , but did not get in@@ definitely food . &quot; I could get more books from the library of the households than eating out of the fridge , &quot; they remembered .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , which was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at some evenings of the landlord Al@@ var@@ enga , to stand beside him and editorial from opposition parties like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to give no faith in the reports of official media via the regime of the dict@@ ator .
he held them for intelligent , but did not enter@@ tain someone with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who spoke , while he talked about politics &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they not often allow me to visit my family , because they think that I would like to return &quot; poor habit . &quot; with this they argu@@ ed that Al@@ var@@ enga belonged to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , to speak at home again their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ í .
their Lord feared that they would have their formation , that she would have allowed her to lose back again .
but she was totally clear that she got up for everything she got up with her hard work .
also in school , Al@@ var@@ onia discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that almost never talked about , bullying and the cab@@ anas that crime are exposed to when they go to school .
because the other children parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ ad@@ ita is .
I was able to invite anyone to my home . I had no friends circle at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in time when friend@@ ships arise , I sens@@ ed especially distinc@@ tly that I was not part of any group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga .
the company che@@ gt the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can find advertis@@ ements for cleaning products and inf@@ n@@ anny in Paraguay .
the administr@@ ators of the group is PE@@ PA Kost@@ ian@@ ki , a city house in the district of As@@ unci@@ on .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who is playing with her in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
for learning .

the ad got five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had been a second @-@ year girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , provided her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; wrote them .

in the course of our history we managed to establish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice born during the Spanish conquest , where the Spanish Con@@ quer@@ ors had to be divided into Paraguay ) and the system of Men@@ s@@ ú ( where the workers were subj@@ ected to their tri@@ bute ) and the system of Men@@ s@@ ú ( where the workers employed as half @-@ slavery ) , that many girls and boys come into a system of slavery from which they become easy victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social inequality in Paraguay and on the show of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
draft law pres@@ cri@@ bes to Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

six@@ ty Egyptian parliament@@ arians have recently voted into a draft law on the regulations of use and use of social networks . &quot;
if he is adopted by the Parliament , users and users must register social media in Egypt with a government authorities to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law , then a place would then be set up , which is tas@@ ked to use citizens a permission to take advantage of social media .
within six months with the adoption of the Act , users and users would have to register on the website of the site with their proper names and recru@@ iting numbers to be able to use social networks .
if it is failed to do so , that might be a punishment of up to six months in prison or a donation .
the draft law , which consists of six par@@ ag@@ raph and used in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de Application , which runs through the Internet and used to communicate with others using voice , video content and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced upon , as the draft should not make an indication of how Egyptian authorities should im@@ pose the users and users the registration . un@@ clear is also how they do not register , in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee the regulation on the stage of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliament@@ arians and Pat@@ rons , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user accounts and users received from the telecommunic@@ ations of telecommunic@@ ations and a password &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocked . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to inv@@ ent a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to which it would require to submit information on its identity to access the network .
but so far it is not known that such plans are .
experts and experts on the spot are skep@@ tical regarding the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; conduc@@ tive Forsch@@ ungst@@ echni@@ cal &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( EI@@ PR , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I doubt strongly of the technical capacity and understanding of any real authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine it as much as they could even control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take it seriously , it means that they should establish a strong surveillance system to filter citizens , permit or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to carry out a court process .
that is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be deb@@ ated at the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance and enforcement shall be successful or not , the draft is consistent with a pro @-@ military thinking in the parliament , in which respects will be maxim@@ ised and to be assured that no de@@ pl@@ ating scar on the image area is , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year the MEP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y proposed a bill for cy@@ ber crime to be found guilty for those who thre@@ aten to be found guilty to thre@@ aten &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the northeast of Iraq , the veter@@ an H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq is to protect the spiritual Persian leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the bigger family of the Leop@@ ards , which goes through Africa and Asia , are among the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to sav@@ ag@@ ery , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they are getting less lo@@ ot , at risk .
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
as R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; is the Persian Leopard the only remaining rob@@ bers in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the prosperity of ecos@@ ystems also depends on the fact that a big rob@@ ber is present .
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards in fact in the free hunting ground is small and goes against zero . when the team in the video provides that they have a shot of a big cat in the cam@@ af@@ all , R@@ aza are in pure joy .
as a trained Biolog@@ in , R@@ aza is passi@@ on@@ ately assi@@ onate to another side of their country , which does not only exist out of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals living animals and educational programs from Nature Iraq for six years .
it has been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to the fact that protection zones for wild animals are set up in the Kur@@ dist@@ an area .

in the beginning of March 2017 , the progress made for the northeast rose Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years to re @-@ establish the lives of those who had been hit by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; from March 2011 . an violent earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima had spar@@ ked disaster .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ newspaper has its headquarters in Send@@ ai , which lies in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i in Japan . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was in Japanese northeast which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring forces of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ished whole coastal cities from the map .
to this end , the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima experienced a nuclear accident , already alone because of this already 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses .
the special report from the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o shows what progress has been achieved after six years in order to re @-@ establish the life of local resident .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authorities as well as survey results of the affected people themselves .
the housing construction in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned range of spare parts ( accompanied , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were completed .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i had the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here , 80 percent of the planned replacement parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has 75 percent of such houses finished , whereas Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima forms the final light in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima .
however , one still makes every effort to continue even six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated from dom@@ it@@ ters ( res@@ umes , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ j@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare parts re@@ um@@ ble .
after the triple disaster , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in homes and accommodation .
in December 2016 still 36 000 people still lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such cases .
almost 40 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated population of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima still live in emergency accommodation , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in case of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . more than 75 percent of ev@@ acu@@ ated vessels , which have been shel@@ ving after the disaster in homes .
for ion , the number is here at 34 per cent .
the state of works and everyday life in the three affected fields
as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper was able to determine 10@@ 74 from 1100 schools , affected by un@@ happiness to December 2016 , which makes nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ecture .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of shipping har@@ b@@ ors in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima only 30 percent of fish@@ eries har@@ b@@ ors have revi@@ ved their operation .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have drawn in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian , in co @-@ scale .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the agricultural country in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima .
it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear un@@ fail@@ ing , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed A@@ cker@@ land of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , are in the &quot; nuclear pl@@ y@@ zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of tourism , the tourism once again reco@@ vering once more , but also the Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima remains far more de@@ pressed .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are over 90 percent in the same state as before the un@@ happiness . Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima can only show 75 percent in contrast .
however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal population , it seems to be harder to earn their livel@@ i@@ hoods .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to obtain a overall picture , the newspaper led numerous question@@ ings under the native population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ated methods . they asked them about the status of reconstruction and also how their feeling has changed compared to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Newspaper .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o conducted a survey to bring more information about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population .
the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 % of local resident , measures have taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ amis .
however , 55.@@ 9 percent of the respon@@ dents are still not done enough in terms of disasters prevention .
as it stands for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ated from the f@@ ecture of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima
in their edition to the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ newspaper has increasingly directed its attention to the situation of ev@@ acu@@ ated Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima .
Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima had to experience not only the tremendous earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima was also witn@@ essed a witness of the worst , disast@@ rous cases , atomic particles in Japan .
of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima have nearly 63 000 people displ@@ aced in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , slightly more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , had been converted into permanent spare parts .
after the booth of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima off their home f@@ ecture .
in the ro@@ aster areas , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated areas are still in temporary shel@@ ters , older than 50 years old . they have to compete in real homes , because the efforts for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima have to compete with massive construction projects . this is a part of project projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo .
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when one encounters people from other countries , the different language appear to be larger than the common ones .
after a while , one reali@@ zes however often that a more connect than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces to expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we cover themes that are often fewer attention in the reporting than they deserve .
we talk to five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment where they have felt very much with someone about language and country borders .
Ver@@ on@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Queen Cam@@ ar@@ asa talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world ; Adriana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brasi@@ lian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care : last Friday had taken him a police force during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . land@@ es@@ far took away millions of demonstr@@ ators to a protest against salvation .

doctors performed him on this Saturday and now have moved it into an artificial compromise .
his state is considered to be critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spread quickly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police be@@ amed to recognize that with a stroke attack . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
according to the incident , the police police were known in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been exp@@ elled until completion of the investigation into the incident of the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he defe@@ ats in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with its impact on the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police force was be@@ aten by a protest@@ ers and land on the intensive care station , his face would see six months on TV and all oppression would be justified .
the Facebook @-@ Page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , divided the video from Lu@@ iz da Luz , which one sees how Mat@@ eus was attacked by the police , and several sanitary briefly to give it to him .
another video of the same scenes , but from another perspective is also fil@@ med in social networks .
in the shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state of state , internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,500 euros ) to cover part of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .

Go@@ i@@ ás , a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ met@@ ry was mur@@ dered by his father , because he had joined the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we got the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman , having been attacked by an polic@@ eman , having taken him with a stroke .
police force
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only State in Brazil where it came to brutal police officers against demonstr@@ ators .
polic@@ emen put in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via loud@@ speaker ste@@ aling against violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this includes a report in fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers around the country .
once again , the Brazilian media is ob@@ struc@@ tive by clicking the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window board .
the fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically on a crus@@ hed glass window in order to illustr@@ ates their titles with a photo their titles .
on the other hand , the O Glo@@ bo preferred a title @-@ story with a fire @-@ driven bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alism reason to report more about a broken window , as well as the protests of thousand people who serve to defend a special matter .
this one must also recognise if you are strictly against any type of state damage .
here , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is also an absurd , dis@@ proportion@@ ate meaning , and the typical non @-@ violence of the military police have pl@@ agu@@ ed by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators &quot; on the confrontation with the police . &quot;
the villages of the de @-@ in@@ duced nation@@ alization in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost 100 % of sugar in Cuba closed the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
the People &apos;s Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an Province of May@@ o@@ que , is commonly referred to as el Central - in Spanish sugar@@ s - known no matter what there is no n@@ enn@@ al@@ able sugar@@ s on site .
it is two years ago , when the activities in the sugar factories were mixed .
after the awakening , the sugar@@ ro@@ gas industry stand still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its installations , until only the sc@@ aff@@ old was left out of steel and concrete .
approximately 290 workers were forced to inv@@ ent .
some altern@@ ate the work .
other re@@ signed and comm@@ ute every day to the factories , which still mah@@ len .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who runs every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar@@ s industry does not smoke his sleep .
he heard that it is in the east of the region of sugar mills , who are after a long in@@ active time in operation , because they have been received .
that was something he was not expecting .
ni@@ ene reminds us that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I would get the sugar@@ ro@@ hr@@ factory would not be kept , but the promise has not been kept .
the sugar@@ s industry have already resi@@ sted the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ effici@@ encies , the bad administration and climate change .
in 2016 the production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced quantity .
this message would have been a motive for alarm for the country a few decades , but the poor harvest@@ s are no longer any news .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar@@ s industry off ?
the old railway track of the congreg@@ ation already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction of the sugar@@ s industry was an economical need : the 155 sugar mills were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became in@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production goals was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories , which can produce sugar for at most than 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives promp@@ ted to such measures were the low productivity of sugar farms and the sugar@@ s in the world market .
nevertheless the sugar price increased from about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound remain , according to the 2016 published report &quot; agricultural perspectives &quot; from the OECD and FA@@ O , agricultural and food organization of the United Nations .
if the current level of 2001 would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.@@ 6 million tons ) , the raw material would manage around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day comes with security into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from there , the process of restructuring in the sugar@@ s began .
in the following years , the inhibit@@ ing of overall 98 sugar mills , more than 65 million people got their full gu@@ ess@@ ory for further training .
the same happened in the sugar@@ ro@@ hr@@ factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked since 1967 in the factory .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , who speaks to the closing of the factory , is the word he repeated the most , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
nearly all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
thus the place will be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time - working group .
in front of the first half @-@ year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially distributed documents that would only be removed with respect to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ at and date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , but the Minister could not appro@@ ve any of the off@@ ence .
from there the responsibility was over , and those letters have always been more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge for two years and he was one who received his letters . &quot; the land had no money for those who were still in operation in the company , he in@@ sured .
Eddy Re@@ yes , 64 years , wa@@ its for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was opposed to his will at the feeding of the factory , in whose construction he helped , particip@@ ates .
with each part he remote , dism@@ ant@@ led he of one of his 31 days @-@ years .
the best developed industrial sector in Cuba and more important work@@ space has been exp@@ ended .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for jobs and services , which generated the systems in the municipalities where they found themselves .
we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mut speech given 21 October 2002 , the dam@@ aging president in the eyes of the present people saw , when he had guaranteed that for the areas , whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would run smoothly .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar mills
since 2004 sugar cane is only extrac@@ ted high by the deposit .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years , the People &apos;s Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , that many things changed , but not always for the better if a factory is closed .
when the sugar@@ ro@@ hr@@ factory closed , or better , when they began to dism@@ iss them , they also listened to the road to asp@@ hal@@ ting , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , ni@@ ene and Eddy had to look for factories .
they have been made to spare parts .
without future perspectives , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production is not even for care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant will continue to be impos@@ ing .
in late 2016 N@@ ene came to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty , the old soldiers bring an ann@@ u@@ ity of two thousand Pes@@ o a month to retirement the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is no thought@@ ful person , yet he gives the lies , that one told him .
they have their cars for ten years .
N@@ ene is about 65 years in R@@ ente , not because it is lacking in power , but because he is bitter .

first Nations you@@ ths use Hip Hop Hop to express their own culture
recording of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First nation .

young people of the First Nations communities in the whole Canada deal with subjects that are important to them . they do this by Hip Hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour we have worked directly to schools and youth centres , in order to teach youth groups , son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audi@@ o- and vide@@ o- and live appearances .
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Quebec with ten C@@ ree communities and then worked with the C@@ ree Hip Hop group The North@@ stars .
the workshop will increase the young participants in conversation such as &quot; cultural identity , language , discussion , love , self acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes up to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which the young people are the main actors .
because workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize other workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &quot; Na A@@ ks@@ a Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ an First nation in British Columbia , for example , called the History of Highway 16 , also called &apos; highway of tears , &quot; on the almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or mur@@ dered .
the cases were largely not illumin@@ ated .
the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the mot@@ if of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of the globalization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youth have not always domin@@ ate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First nation have recorded , the ref@@ rain will be made on C@@ ree .
the young@@ sters got some help from Gary Jol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hip Hop Hop group , who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
on the fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an is available to the St@@ rop@@ he magazine , also a translation into English , translated into German by :
sometimes I feel as if none were ever interested in me
but I try to go on earth for my days
this is the day when you will take our cry out !
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise one day to us
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad living
this is how they can grow and also lead to our youth
so they can do that , which determines the Creator

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu will be displayed exactly on the menu , are nearby the entrance sho@@ a san@@ gu@@ u ( res@@ umes , &quot; Plast@@ ische Modelle der dishes &quot; ) issued by every dish that is served in this restaurant .
the customers look at these plastic @-@ dishes and then decide whether they enter or go on the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic geri@@ es .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a variety of these small companies that just produce those sculp@@ tural dishes produced by the German film@@ makers Wim Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese are these plastic @-@ based foods so usually they do not even reflect on them . however , a new trend is now turning it into show@@ y phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
from Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published in the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sho@@ gs .
now in the special sale : new with plastic geri@@ es decorative panels , as they are shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
many of this artificial foods have been turned to kit@@ sch@@ y group@@ ed objects , as in this case , refriger@@ ation magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ hin Cool@@ er &apos;s magn@@ ets for a new show at Tokyo station .
the new boom Tru@@ e@@ ets is becoming increasingly we@@ en@@ ched .
in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular guide with seafood ) is turned into a cell @-@ stand .
for this tri@@ ang@@ ular bowl ( lol ) we have found a good use as a cell phone .
also this part we have produced for the exhibition at the Tokyo train station .
and here is an apple that runs your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is just the beginning of a growing approach into the com@@ ic .
some mobile plu@@ gs and mobile devices allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or sal@@ mon was used , a popular to@@ pping , served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; if there would be someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wow , cool , now I can listen to my mobile phone with sal@@ mon @-@ s@@ ats ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only couple .
this interest in plastic geri@@ es can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our new mobile @-@ stand has the shape of mel@@ mel@@ ting ice .
in addition we also have routes ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ yb@@ ines from dried sal@@ mon .
other skep@@ um plastic geri@@ chte can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the has@@ ht@@ ag # SU@@ P@@ TION .
if you would like to know more about the origin of these trends , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which dedicated to satisfying the restaurant industry . as for example , jump to the sho@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic @-@ based foods are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survi@@ vor@@ s of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media via the in@@ famous &quot; struggle against drug trading &quot; in Mexico , the missing and un@@ covered regularly only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy which brings that fight with them .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , Chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Kart@@ ell , thr@@ ust the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
on the day after a violent di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , someone does not look at the m@@ our@@ n or in the communities who have learned to live with the pain .
thereby lies behind every cor@@ pse , behind every bone mar@@ row in the hundreds of married gra@@ ves , the stories un@@ spoiled parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose gu@@ unds may never heal .
that is why the Mexican news portal Anim@@ al Pol@@ í@@ tico holds the digital project &quot; Apr@@ any a Vivi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug dealers , &quot; ) to give this sacrifice a voice and tells stories about people who made the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
Anim@@ al Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the impact is much more profound .
for example , if shops are close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and all communities therefore need to drive a lot of kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vi@@ das que cam@@ bian por el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as fear lives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who fled every weekend of married tom@@ bs after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Rod@@ r@@ í@@ guez , who settled in just a single day her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of their ne@@ ph@@ ew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we prepare for the task today that we have asked ourselves to go and go to gra@@ ves after the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras M@@ ata .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electr@@ o @-@ business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment they have no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but it does not get paid because that demand a mort@@ ar de@@ valu@@ ation .
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ i a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explains why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those who are to fear . we have to show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and government leadership .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Anim@@ al Pol@@ í@@ tico , made this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central mex@@ ico .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be seen as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
disease and Sens@@ ation@@ journ@@ alism I have been known for some years now .
I am passing on every day of time circles and see the front pages with images , which can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the Only , which is bl@@ amed or sad . it works , like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or do this as normal .
it writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year c@@ ous@@ in thinks that he will be fool@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) will be when he &apos;s big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the off@@ ence when going through the streets .
for me it is as if they were those of the people who have lost someone and those who have fear that they have happened to them too .
I see our weakness if stories are on mere figures in a stati@@ stic .
the energy e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness of the people is incredible for me if the death of six people and the dis@@ appearances of 43 students will be justified in a neigh@@ bor whom they were &apos; emerging . &quot;
I think they try to speak out that they are spar@@ ed by such trag@@ e@@ dies , if they are not st@@ ir and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four month Re@@ press@@ tion in the Haupt@@ stadt@@ kultur@@ kt : how a family with@@ drawn with threats . &quot; therein , she describes how armed crimin@@ als month for month put money from their business until they had been destroyed not only the business , but also their family apart .
you think of all that you have lost and about how many people can change your entire lives in just a few days .
the pain over never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , telephone numbers .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are from each other , the better .
she included her report with the words :
we want to be arrested for others , for you don &apos;t know when they will run or kill you .
I was wondering if wines would solve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the reply is no , because I forgot how you cri@@ es . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega released the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of the violence signed by force . &quot;
in the introduction he asks questions about : who takes care of the child of a mis@@ led woman and a man who was mur@@ dered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ik@@ os ?
it is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is a Wa@@ ist and he tells us he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , potatoes , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the fl@@ utes with water , sugar and milk powder .
he relates to the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are un@@ important compared to the pain in his eyes - an explanation of a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old he told him that his mother disappeared .
but that was not the day when his childhood came .
his childhood has been past two years ago , when he was just a few blocks from his home , the bloody bodies of his father saw , created by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez saw the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and fighting against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of people , according to the Council of public security and the Government of the United States Government .
alone in 2010 the prosec@@ ut@@ ors 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this is equivalent to the in@@ cis@@ ion of 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories , that leave organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only few stories are living ever ahead of time . this project reminds us of those we must not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ any a Vivi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; has established the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective is to raise the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trading that the country has tor@@ tured in the past four decades in a understand@@ ably manner .
if a picture is worth a thousand uncomfortable words
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flick@@ r User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this entry and the pages to which he links , contain images on which violence is shown .
the point check is important in a moment when it is about to raise a rum@@ or , or to make a for@@ gery .
but how is the years after something the first time is sur@@ faced ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , t@@ ends to continue to exist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic Congo ( DR@@ C ) .
since its first release it was leading irre@@ plac@@ eable , trag@@ e@@ dies actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false p@@ airing of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology by Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - deny the fact that there are plenty of car@@ ef@@ ull reporting about events in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions to our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
2010 passed a gas station to the village S@@ ange in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo , ki@@ pp@@ le around and explo@@ ded . there were 230 people around life .
after the civil war in Africa the second @-@ largest country had been neglected and thereby devast@@ ated . its streets in the region have become dangerous paths full of stro@@ kes , which were difficult to sail .
typically , the gas station fell victim to the victim .
administration &apos;s representatives described a fire@@ ball , the d@@ utz@@ ing houses un@@ covered , including a cinema in the vicinity , which was full of people who illustr@@ ates the football world .
houses ver@@ bled and res@@ ump@@ y cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the un@@ spo@@ ilt .
a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria &apos; . from Im@@ g@@ ur users Myst@@ ical Mon@@ key , 12 . January 201@@ 5.@@ Mehr@@ ere photos of the incident form the grey @-@ full scenes of this day .
above is an example of that .
it shows chains of short@@ com@@ bs which are on the floor when people watch them .
but here history does not find its end .
over the years , the same photo has been applied several times into social media , blogs and other platforms , but may not be attributed to related trag@@ e@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , B@@ oko Har@@ am took the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye @-@ witnesses reported dra@@ st@@ ically by atro@@ cities before they had to fle@@ e .
houses and shops have been burnt down and Lei@@ ch@@ name were located in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a local people for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were das@@ hed , shot or burned .
only by means of satellite images , the following time could be previ@@ ew@@ ed .
the cause for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the arm@@ ies in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict @-@ conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ an and an attempt to win the B@@ oko Har@@ am in the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture taken from the Democratic Republic of Congo back to , when it was mis@@ diagnosed as proof of the fact and the potential extent of attack :
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ ac@@ re of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris .
it is not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this abuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of undes@@ irable supplements ; Africa Check has documented assign@@ ments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all of these cases the picture was presented as a test@@ ament to mass charges .
another step further bring personal comments like this example mis@@ understand@@ ably the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange joined in Myanmar with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Br@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a light@@ ning , published by the United Nations , those who were able to fle@@ e , rape and alle@@ ged deaths , some by burning .
while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , post@@ ers like the following that these descriptions with photos from the Democratic Republic of Congo brought together :
this picture comes from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab news across the 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein being said , mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims ; in addition she had used the image of the Democratic Republic of Congo to cover this information .
the original report , which was recently launched on 26 April 2017 , can be called here .
other intelligence agencies , which de@@ du@@ ed AF@@ P as their source , had also mis@@ diagnosed Th@@ ein being this statement , but did not get the image of the DR Congo in connection .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this false cross @-@ cou@@ ps range until the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from anywhere around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information borders can exceed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a comm@@ ited picture look with the search engine Tin@@ ax has found under 18,@@ 8 billion images ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 photos that have been very similar to the occupied image of the DR Congo .
they come from a mis@@ ch@@ mas@@ ch private pages , platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek , and Portuguese .
some have passed on false reports , others have tried to infl@@ un@@ ning the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing .
we have indicated examples of the ab@@ usi@@ ve exploitation and associated with the respective countries on which side they have been published . we want to be clear@@ er the range than by the language alone .
in some cases the countries ( which in some cases were also associated with each other ) several examples of ab@@ used use can be used .
here some cases that can now be completely washed away ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false p@@ ups from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the or@@ an@@ ised countries point on pages or servers , over the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ s@@ ling are still available .
the countries in Gray are examples that are subject to met@@ adata and information which are available about Tin@@ y@@ Eye , probably also for@@ f@@ eit@@ ing examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the picture from the Democratic Republic of Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( was directed at Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread at the &quot; war of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this post , a blo@@ gger of Quebec City not only identi@@ fies the folder , but also discussed the abuse of the picture from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the persons and the re@@ juven@@ ated trag@@ e@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los c@@ rist@@ ian@@ os ( in Nigeria they burned up Christians ) .

la Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca quot@@ ed as its source of the Spanish news Agency E@@ fe ( though not known whether the original report has the image ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ ote after the mass@@ ac@@ re of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this here , who were used to illustrate the image of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; have clearly seen no pages such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster that dis@@ si@@ sts this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster design@@ ates the faul@@ ty use of the picture since 2011 in connection with Nigeria , then promoted by a post of U.S. , anti @-@ Islamic comm@@ ent@@ ators in Pam@@ ela G@@ eller .

this article focuses on the continuing hard@@ ship of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar , but the work of an article of the Indian Express with the image of the Democratic Republic of the Congo ; the article of Indian Express had not included the publication of our contribution to this picture .

Iran , 2012 .
a Association of students of the@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter for the support of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims about the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and to illustrate the image of DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
a resident of the Old Town , Pie@@ dic@@ ast@@ ello of Tr@@ ento posted this message to his side to express his solidarity with the s@@ laughter of Nigeria 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from the Democratic Republic of Congo was seen as a evidence for the bom@@ bing of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an ab@@ usi@@ ve use of the picture from the Democratic Republic of Congo , with the one hand a twe@@ et , the sympathy against the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ ac@@ re and on the other hand the attempt of a Blo@@ ggers , the alleg@@ ations , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are tr@@ acked to del@@ ig@@ ate , since the photos of it were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the Myanmar Government published a jud@@ gement on what they came as &quot; deliber@@ ately fin@@ alised news and photographs , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions regarding Myanmar . &quot;
this jud@@ gement that has been published exclusively in English also includes references to counter@@ f@@ eit images of rum@@ ors who run H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to set out that Muslims are Budd@@ hist@@ s kill and the other way ( which often is spread by bur@@ mes@@ an nation@@ alists ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ie ри@@ ст@@ и@@ ан@@ о@@ ф@@ ш@@ и@@ я пи@@ л@@ и б@@ р@@ ь@@ к@@ ц@@ и@@ я ш@@ и@@ я ш@@ и@@ я ш@@ и@@ я , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this mail , which was directed to the members of the Russian @-@ Orthodox Church , showed clear that the picture of the DR Congo are not showing Muslims killing the Christians .
Saudi @-@ Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this message ev@@ ed@@ ged that the president of Myanmar had commented that the president of Myanmar with me that mon@@ ks and politicians took part in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims ; and brought together the story of the picture together with the picture .
the article was updated in 2014 and is currently included in this publication .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article by 2014 on Stu@@ dents who were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the show@@ room An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly stated that the image does not origin@@ ate from the k@@ ill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar glo@@ omy attack . &quot;
as the picture later in connection with the mass@@ ac@@ re of B@@ oko Har@@ am from 2015 in turn , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to res@@ ist that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ se@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ ger U@@ y@@ uy &quot; ( Nigeria bur@@ ns , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo di@@ pped , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ has@@ ht@@ ag , and used a discussion among Muslims according to the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the proposal to Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities were taking these events , the mut@@ ually in the name of Islam , a greater attention z@@ ol@@ len .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was dot@@ ted as a test@@ ament to the mass@@ ac@@ re of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ et@@ et ) . but the messages that were connected to it were inter@@ ven@@ ed in any religious context .
instead , the goal was to focus attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of the media reporting relevant to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was supposed to be written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ ac@@ re , translated it discussion , like this here on Vietnamese and explained it to fal@@ s@@ cription .
from the message , in which the picture was contained in the Democratic Republic of Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are further confirmed examples of an incomplete use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
at other accounts , ag@@ greg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the cap in Grau ) , inks are also no longer fully re@@ trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data @-@ yiel@@ ds with UR@@ Ls and tim@@ es@@ - / data stamp exist on the web cra@@ b and termin@@ ate them via image file in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all of those cases , which appeared only clearly after the original un@@ gl@@ am@@ ity of 2010 , the picture is ultimately possibly a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( frames ) that under@@ go this post@@ ings . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in terms of major discussion about silence in connection with the murder of Christians from Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second fr@@ aming also uses the image to discuss how a African life is under@@ valued as compared to a European or French life .
religion should be understood and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is imperative to examine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question is what happens when readers cannot give these images longer any longer .
with social media , there are two people who are acci@@ dental that the water round about a tragedy .
suggested this mood of mis@@ carriage and false information , that actual atro@@ cities are in@@ true and nar@@ row@@ ed it the actual gr@@ auen of what actually happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been given in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that with@@ hold of images of a ref@@ us@@ al , to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern that violent images readers and audience are des@@ ens@@ iti@@ ze and give them the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which was supposed to work like violent media on it , others ) .
while there is some way to discuss violent inci@@ dents in the news media , fact that they are indispensable for the current news report .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of the smaller languages

a blog with the name of Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ) attempts to offer language excited a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to be translated at all .
such words are available in any language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these non @-@ translated words are already well known ( as the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all resi@@ sts stub@@ born every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes some context is required to exactly understand what is meant by that one word .
these unique words have been collected quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist came from &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird , in order to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog you can find the example words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - pick you up your parents in recognition of how to make you tried in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - The convenience or la@@ zin@@ ess that you feel after having war@@ med up to cold days in the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his Blog About :
they sli@@ ces other cultures , reve@@ aling other mind@@ set and ar@@ ouses our curiosity .
sometimes you will affect the world around us and classi@@ fy the Lingu@@ ists on this site still want to publish more of these &quot; un@@ wa@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and ev@@ oc@@ ative of these small languages .
Red@@ ner of the &quot; Tre@@ asure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are much appreciated by the trans@@ lat@@ lat@@ able , they are invited to upload their favorite sw@@ ers here .

in Sri Lanka with the worst nav@@ al disaster of the decade
the is@@ state of Sri Lanka is currently looking at the worst of flood and waste @-@ cat@@ astrop@@ hic disaster in the decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon which usually stands in late May , by strong rain falls the rivers cal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , gin , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tit@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 district in the south and west of the country over the banks .
after an opinion of the cat@@ astroph@@ ism of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of men are mixed because of the flo@@ ods and mud .
more than 400 000 people have been affected by the last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people were brought to in for a safe residence .
the rains left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the waters in some areas went slowly .
health and hygiene relationships are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible fields .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood@@ disaster :
flo@@ ods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water periods of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like Azz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et provide regular updates on the high water situation .
many use the has@@ ht@@ ag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly flo@@ ods are wor@@ sen the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ eber@@ crisis , war@@ ns Save the Children , after further rain falls are already on the way .
today tomorrow the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus rose up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ag@@ oda during G@@ alle also flood@@ ed with G@@ alle also flood@@ ed because of the yesterday evening water p@@ eg@@ els of Mor@@ og@@ oda E@@ la .
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and another five are used for transportation of emergency services included in their flood@@ ed villages .
also various organizations and start @-@ ups have explained to help .
Facebook page like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tory in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water supply and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue @-@ ships Dro@@ h@@ nen require for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and life @-@ needed goods for high @-@ water @-@ offering -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 , if animals in this area need help .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) tells people to share their location data using the App for inform@@ ing the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ centers .
last year after the disaster of the Tro@@ pen@@ stur@@ m Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me held a &quot; high water aid &quot; button , which allowed it to call a vehicle to pick up aid and donations . these have then been sent to the Sri Lan@@ kan Red Cross free of charge .
similarly , they led a &quot; SOS &quot; button , which had more than thousands of requests and 150 successful bo@@ aters for flood @-@ water and land@@ slide holes as well as completed people .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , they bring people in need of safety and contributing to the help .
this has prevented the loss of further lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
when I joined the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and love friend on the Women &apos;s March .
I trusted her my four year old daughter , they trust me their children ; she is my rock in the branch .
for a minute , we still call for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ id , we are working for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of rainy and people , some consider the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , bound from an American flag , others sk@@ id@@ ding blocks to Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend look at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things concern not you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led these entertainment .
people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslim &quot; that has built up in their conception .
it is Muslim me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we are practi@@ cing our religion differently .
we identify with it being Muslim to be a Muslim . but somehow we all put together into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well designed in our collective imagination , that as soon as Muslims , who are not to fit sub@@ lim@@ it@@ ated there .
to be de@@ fi@@ lim@@ ated
I am not alone .
this is even the poet , whose poetry in America is mostly sold : Rum@@ i .
which images come in mind , if you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ an Sh@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a orthodo@@ x@@ er Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an , and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the western performance the religion is Rum@@ is deleted , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a great part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims from this world .
another consists of the reduced images of Muslims that have been colon@@ ized by Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image is determined by the dark man who should fear and the exotic wife you should save .
the landmark Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ assembled in the 19@@ 70s the story behind these pictures .
but these pictures also rise further today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to fle@@ e them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have worked for three years in the message industry , and I have seen how this powerful , failed scar@@ ring are domin@@ ating our news fe@@ eds .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries over the last three decades , while the USA were not even able to elect their first female presidential election .
this nar@@ ration fails to recognize that if French , Muslim women are hin@@ dered to carry their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and s@@ our Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover the entire body , which both sides are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group is raising its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this powerful Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it seems to be seen that the first Muslim prayers on the American ground of Afri@@ kan@@ ers were talked to have been brought down with slave &apos;s craft .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative has under@@ gone our collective imagination to so deep and f@@ law@@ ed , that often Sik@@ h men and children are aimed at the target of anti @-@ ag@@ asy attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ations .
because of these stories , we tell and about the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the other . &quot;
belong to 1.7 billion
in the news industry , we do more than just stories to tell stories that are based on facts .
or in alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative that help us understand the world .
and my industry is amazing to realize the Nar@@ r@@ ative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we are here in mind where seven million Muslims attain the highest degree of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation that come from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my gu@@ ed parents arrived in New York to live her US dream .
my mother lay her first jewel design on 5th Avenue before and my father was working hard in skyscr@@ apers of New York . skyscr@@ apers were made possible thanks to the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh and the name of Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan was re@@ thought of the world of the world , my parents were un@@ um@@ wo@@ unds Muslims and Americans .
but am I now un@@ um@@ wo@@ unds Muslims and Americans ?
sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t tell a pig meat , I say - rather than to recover my Muslim recipes or to make my hand@@ some pick@@ pocket , to wear all the Muslims - &quot; made of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I Scher@@ ze , we do not wear all pick@@ pocket with us .
we do not need to be the@@ ological expert to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ar , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists who strive to fight for widespread lies of Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing band from a well @-@ decorated Islam@@ ist cel@@ ery with cred@@ itors , Th@@ ink tanks and experts for Fal@@ sch@@ information which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and about the way we tell them , Islam@@ abad is in more than just a stran@@ ger that a woman has im@@ poses the head of the head .

I want to explain that .
I was born as the Muslim but to be a Muslim but was only born in my imagination when I was four years old , in a pro@@ visional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York .
if social @-@ scientist describe religious life , they refer to the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim belief and behaviour might not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my friend , my neigh@@ bor , my neigh@@ bor , I would see that I am Muslim when she could look through the 15 feet of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ ab@@ end@@ ly ritual with my daughter if I lie in my arms , and her the Arab verses to protect the protection of the Qur &apos;an and called Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one you can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim belief is perhaps not always visible , but my Muslim origin is always part of my shadow .

affili@@ ation is the image of my grand@@ mother &apos;s mother @-@ on @-@ hand with her sisters , as they win a contest of art of the flower head in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the image of it that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : N@@ ano , surrounded by its finished and un@@ finished paintings paintings , Su@@ fi hid ; and one cor@@ ans with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and forty @-@ four chapters that she can virtually maneu@@ ver@@ able .
Muslims said to be the prayers , which she said to me , If I have a bad day .
Islam has to be in it , as she brought me to God , Allah M@@ ian , what God means my only Lord .
for a nation , which - over centuries - by a &quot; Empire &quot; was established , a company formed with the name of Ven@@ erable Brit@@ ische Ost@@ ini@@ dia company , it has a deep meaning , God , my only Lord .

belonging means to grow and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my zu@@ f@@ ander@@ ed grandfather was cr@@ ying .
inter@@ rup@@ tly , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana Ja@@ an un@@ wo@@ unds to his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he had not allowed into his arms in a half century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions Kurds and Palestinians , their families , as were in my grandfather , from colon@@ ists who have dealt with the Muslim world as at the game risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Islam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meant to know that in the last two centuries Europeans all have imposed all the way to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that the first fli@@ pping bom@@ b was shed in history before a century on a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir and tan of British empire , was called &quot; hazardous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous . &quot;
even before there were air@@ planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim trunk of 1.7 billion to one go deep into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ ess ; our un@@ cover@@ ings history .
it means to remember that four@@ teen years ago the migh@@ ti@@ est military in the world , with troops that have gone beyond any continent apart from the Antarc@@ tic , in Iraq , to follow weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means to know that more than half an millions of Ira@@ q@@ is buried among the ruins of the war .
its American Muslim means to know that the su@@ icide rate of veter@@ ans since 2001 has risen by more than 32 percent .
it means knowing that if a tragedy took to the USA and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name which tells the story four times more than a story with a white attack .
it means to know that forty years ago the first prayer call , the A@@ za@@ an , was called by a liber@@ ated black slaves named Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad cl@@ av@@ ed and brought to this country two hundred years ago .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X a US hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people filled up the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life count .
an American teacher , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist who has inter@@ sec@@ ted inter@@ sec@@ ted ident@@ ities , but in doing so , they communicate to others .
the Nar@@ r@@ ative of 1.7 billion contains more possibilities than a sor@@ c@@ ator , but is represented in the reduced branches , &quot; we &quot; against &quot; they . &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , well knowing that power@@ fully and privileged people will build on this branch of structural f@@ us@@ efulness .
structural Islam@@ ism consists in the Muslim registr@@ ar that began with President Bush and extended to President Obama .
it consists of penet@@ rating monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration officer that takes a five @-@ year old child in hand @-@ cell .
it exists in a country that ex@@ cludes its boundaries towards people from just the countries that are bombar@@ ded it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ Fly list , &quot; which takes largely Arabs and Muslims into the Vis@@ ier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are the wars that we are leading and the bom@@ bs which we ab@@ throw in Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and about those we are not telling , we are here today .
in a study entitled Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University were a scienti@@ fically striking image and coordinates them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with regard to evolution .
Muslims received the sli@@ gh@@ test score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations , which we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are deeply committed to det@@ ach the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stand back decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous representation that we ste@@ er in our news transactions .
at least , there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to reconc@@ ile our lives with tap@@ ed ident@@ ities and forgotten history .

but I &apos;m concerned about this difficult global point in which we find ourselves .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1,7 billion .
there is one reason for conspir@@ acy the@@ or@@ ist the@@ or@@ tic that existed in the dark corners of the internet , now carrying the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ entially because they have made Muslims too . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years ago , they had not given them yet ; now they are masters of great areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am worried about the realities and the story that I was not aware of when I was so old as it is now my daughter , but who did me to become a non @-@ found Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot;
things that I have left here like a bread@@ th herb in my speech .
things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sec@@ tions which makes our humanity a story , where someone is made to another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations will be held at the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ abad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more than one hundred academies speak about our problems with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools , or we can read in our newspapers .
Posters of the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of the Islam@@ opho@@ bia Studies Network .
all of us have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where there is Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and humans being be@@ amed by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in public perception , four decades ago of the Stan@@ ford .
we must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of this , conscious and un@@ aware the &quot; other &quot; to soli@@ di@@ fy , as it is my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , while he already made us a new future , in which we have already broken lands and &quot; to other &quot; people bom@@ bed , far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for nar@@ ration wants to safeguard urban diversity
local news , Flick@@ r @-@ users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to connect here and now despite a language barrier to someone ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Tre@@ asure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the number of stories written in its original language .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written report , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of major cities .
in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages do not pass that born children there .
for the creators of the project are :
the mass display of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that will not forget diversity - safe areas where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to attend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often , it is often linked to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just@@ i@@ fies these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to appreciate to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format you can learn and translate their story first in her own language , or explain it in English .
even if the participants do not have professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , they guide their devot@@ ion and their representation to the fact that the audi@@ ences can be att@@ ained .
they give laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows for example a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ ellers R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou con@@ cludes also the opportunity to explain for their country typical customs of narr@@ ative art .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the barrel of the rab@@ bit and the p@@ add@@ les in the language Sh@@ ona from Zim@@ babwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the importance of his plot , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a wide ridge he shares his sense of the inclusi@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have heard !
you were attentive ...
you were very happy with me !
so far the events of Tre@@ asure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand it . all that are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS , in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls for res@@ ump@@ tion of the sovereig@@ n debt
with the aim of a re@@ examination of public debt by Puerto Rico , which took place on 72 million US dollars , participating in the past 3 April 2017 , various religious and civil organisations involved in a mass demonstration ; the march depart@@ ing in the Capit@@ ol Capit@@ ol , the Government Building of the Capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was declared by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano por la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; ( Bürger@@ Front für die Neur@@ exam of debts ) and the Eastern Church General Meeting in Puerto Rico .
the inter@@ c@@ essors of the ren@@ unci@@ ation of debt has also submitted a pet@@ ition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico calls for the politicians , ben@@ ker and government authorities , who are responsible for debts for their corrupt .
we call for financial testing and editorial committee without personal interests in public debt , with strong , our working conditions appropriate re@@ mun@@ eration , which acts in favor of the economy .
we will er@@ pressed and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os refused to pay a debt that is not their place .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with decl@@ ining pen@@ sion@@ ations .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not to the eastern territory of the USA - suff@@ ers from a serious financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on the socio @-@ economic development , a law on the state responsibility before , as an alternative to existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
the measures imposed from the outside without participation and conviction of the citizens of danger , being rejected by the people .
the demonstration took the name of &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

his name was kn@@ itted from the directory of the Ad@@ ra pris@@ ons , in which he sat in place on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information on its current state or residence .
the intro@@ duc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory exists his friends and family a voice that push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for its involvement in a free culture , many of us have started to think about its own destin@@ ies , actions and decisions .
why are we today ?
what did we have chosen ?
what have we given up to extreme beliefs about this process ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in cust@@ ody sy@@ r@@ ist government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the Ad@@ ra prison , a non @-@ military facility to a unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; police police Bass@@ el reported on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military bed from his cell in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported it was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who presented themselves as a insi@@ der of Assad &apos;s government and inform them about her husband &apos;s death .
his place of residence and condition continues to stay unknown .
a leading the Creative Commons in Syria and active on projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a vital role in expanding access to the internet and to the knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and currently trans@@ itional the Director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , the Bass@@ el founded on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
maybe none of Bas@@ ed cultural prototype are forward @-@ sigh@@ ted than the work he began with a group of ar@@ che@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 in order to rest@@ art the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cru@@ ci@@ ast@@ le of numerous ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations and here in Greek @-@ Roman architecture typical with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would act on it , this architecture , which em@@ bo@@ died not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this stri@@ pe into the digital ar@@ che@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
typically , bass @-@ b@@ ur of this project has not yet been shut down .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the man &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my entire life in order to dream of freedom and bass clarinet taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call its name n@@ enne .
Bass@@ el brought me English at , even when he was already in cust@@ ody .
I learned to read English well , to write and speak .
he has always shared his knowledge with each one that was asked . he taught other incar@@ n@@ ini , English to write and speak .
Bass@@ el has opened my door to technology . he taught me to use both computer and smartphones .
he brought me the internet upon me .
he has also brought others to others how they use computers , at least theoretically , without being able to actually make one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the writer of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a commission that she wrote in the years 2012 till 2015 her husband when he was in cust@@ ody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ oura have worked together on the book for one year .
she sho@@ cked the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he translated them from the Arab to English .
the book is license @-@ free available .
cover from Youssef I@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It takes place &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens during each visit ,
that I have failed in the world of your enchanting sight ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment , in which we embrace .
that each of the dangers is no matter ,
everyone of the f@@ ences , fol@@ ds and gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I forget the thr@@ ong of prison
and I move into every detail of your voice and words .
which I am with passion for me ,
if your eyes certainly say
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ eliness .
to return all the moments
and about your absence to smile and smile .
I over@@ came myself , that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the det@@ ention of Bass@@ el wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
a year for@@ ting my soul
during a time
I am in your c@@ age ,
and you are still in c@@ age of monsters
Bas@@ ed History is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 , against the regime of Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , the Syrian network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for Human Rights ) has disappeared more than 65,@@ 000 people .
those who were arrested or killed under violence by the regime disappeared , were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nest@@ y International has died at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans in prison .
the stories of many more people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we reiter@@ ate our demand today in the hope that we have to do so for the last time .
Mos@@ ambi@@ que : because of corruption administr@@ ators , release from release back to prior release .
Mos@@ ambi@@ ental re@@ acted with anger in a cor@@ rupted case where a government link after half of his sentence returned to the place at the state apparatus , where the corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for di@@ version with four other def@@ endants ( roughly 800 000 Euros ) for 22 years imprisonment .
the money came from public funds at Moz@@ ambi@@ que airports whose Council Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately demanding his re@@ inst@@ at@@ ement into the company , which happened on April 19 then .
in accordance with an opinion by the General Assembly of the Republic , which were regi@@ stering to the request , there would be no obstacles of Cam@@ b@@ aza to resume their previous post , as the firm did not pursue any discipl@@ in@@ arian procedure according to his det@@ ention .
however , many citizens do not include action well .
the Centre for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de p@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , brief CI@@ P ) , a local institution that advoc@@ ates for public transparency , do@@ omed in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to resume the director :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clar@@ i@@ fies the lack of transparency and even greater transparency in relation to the efforts of our law so the CI@@ P .
what we take note is that the company should initi@@ ate a discipl@@ in@@ arian procedure against the as@@ res@@ cu@@ ing process .
the company seems to see however and promp@@ ted no adequate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Muslim &apos;s social media , also reject this behavior as well and considers the case as &quot; dis@@ war@@ dly &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent guy , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a sentence and took half away .
he may hold lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could give advice and to pol@@ ish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has en@@ acted to re@@ integrate into the company which he helped to cause damage .
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will be eager for his silence .
resistant !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ cans and Student der Political Science in Brazil says that director poss@@ essing no moral :
Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state because he off@@ s it and cannot believe you be rewarded with someone in such a way that the state has already suffered so massive .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is lacking the mor@@ ality and serve the state ; * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead , only served themselves by the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as hand@@ some it &apos;s an in@@ exhau@@ sti@@ ble money source and the state itself is tired of this man who was un@@ loaded and finally condemned to a long det@@ ention .
honestly speaking , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ er@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind you that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remain the Moz@@ ambi@@ kan@@ ers not only for ever as the first independent president but also as a sharp , collap@@ sing and - next door - proph@@ etic speakers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of his most famous sil@@ ly depic@@ tions was , when he confirmed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ambitious person is capable of all , also the f@@ ather@@ land for its ambitions , its own individual interest to sell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tactics but he does not apply from his ambitions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ambitious man is the same time crimin@@ ally . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were off as well :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was running 10 years off and came free .
and today the firm puts him in , in which he exp@@ ire money , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ Vai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Su@@ g@@ inal Show ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik )

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users to in@@ justice
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar P@@ ae &apos; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or Sp@@ alter@@ b@@ se .

according to data from Facebook users in Myanmar , the popular social network recorded its Post@@ s from the net because it contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word still is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people ost@@ ensi@@ an origin , or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective . &quot;
Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; Contin@@ ue &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese manuscript ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of Hass@@ en@@ language in Burma in the social network .
in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely valuable con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is commonly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat Hass@@ an in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism but the word itself is not automatically calling to Hass@@ an .
the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also post@@ ers in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed as to its use .
moreover , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings which have the same letters as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ mes@@ o also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar P@@ ae &apos; ( Sp@@ alter@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ n@@ utzer A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends has been cle@@ ared today because he contained the word of Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a spiritual manner , whether it might be k@@ issed his back pain by giving a word of word .
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the Fr@@ age@@ face ( la ) at Bur@@ mes@@ o - res@@ embles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there have been several reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ills is the opinion that they will reduce hate speech radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook analy@@ tic be powers before it def@@ ends all the post@@ ers that are made in suspic@@ ion , racism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fil@@ tering the word automatically .
automatic shu@@ ism will not understand what you read on fac@@ et .
what it should do instead is to analyze the post and control it by checking the next words .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar P@@ ae &quot; ( Sp@@ alter@@ b@@ sen ) .
the good is that these three @-@ legged nation@@ alists are spreading the Hass@@ an , a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circum@@ cis@@ es its nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all who distribute the Hass@@ an , the efficiency of this strategy might not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ aker demonstrated that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often will start a cat and mouse play , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described as Facebook started to clear his posts as he wanted to tell his friends just that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive by Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ir@@ on@@ ically my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited the ch@@ icks , post and parts of content for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook community standards was not addressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook has a large number of people from people who have no negative purposes or they just try to portra@@ y their opinions against the hate speech radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed , who has nothing to do with Hass@@ an :
post without hate speech made by Facebook .
in the post , the author informed his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have to do more before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ y@@ mes@@ an internet community to ask for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform but it does not work .
such words to be cen@@ sored only more hate within the different communities .
it seems that they started out this without a local context or technical support and have forbidden as words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they didn &apos;t try to correct the fal@@ sely solved Post@@ s .
if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefit , they would have a big sales to them , this would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has taken care of for much sp@@ aghetti among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now cur@@ led by Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ an &apos;s language to see whether their post@@ ings will be taken from the web .
here you can see some scre@@ enshots from Facebook @-@ Post@@ s that were not a Hass@@ an Pictures , but yet away :
with permission to use .
the Bur@@ mes@@ an lyrics &quot; is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and pe@@ an curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to check out whether Facebook is the mail which the word of Kal@@ ar contains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screens@@ hot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screens@@ hot , used with permission .
in the last five years there are extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their votes and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks is also planned to secre@@ tly in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area Rak@@ h@@ ine , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands of escape to escape .
Facebook was meant for his failure , the bal@@ u@@ ber@@ ing hate speech on his bur@@ mes@@ an sites led to control , critic@@ ised .
yet instead of being able to lau@@ re@@ ate the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ at , it would have better to focus more on context rather than on code len@@ ght initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is the end with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding @-@ ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country un@@ anim@@ ously decided to un@@ anim@@ ate a law which shall betra@@ y this practice , so that the pro@@ of@@ ed age is now at 18 .
prior to this change of the adul@@ ter@@ ation , some members were held in du@@ sting and Muslim religion . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aja , the leader of the inter @-@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , the representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered , that the state does not inter@@ f@@ ere , since that , age is not the maturity pun@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened in no matter of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner for the UN &apos;s right to meet the min@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the min@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; every human being under the age of 18 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married with 15 in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent , and at 18 were 8.@@ 1 percent .
2011 confirmed the statistical summary of the country that since 1997 @-@ 2007 were married more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys below 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media @-@ movements that seek to drive laws to inf@@ ant @-@ marriage , followed at the foot and delighted with great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this outcome .
however , it was not all smoothly .
a Hind@@ u @-@ leader Z. B. had no concerns , the critics of the children &apos;s @-@ toe , they should , is dam@@ n to take care of her own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition to tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point raises doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the law .
but early in 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which contained himself in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the President of the country must appro@@ ve and declare the law asser@@ ted .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a status update which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle click on Inst@@ agram again :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ramb@@ har@@ at : the draft law against the children &apos;s marriage was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for this and not a single against against it .
after having decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of the social media @-@ users had been enthusiastic because the laws on inf@@ ants have finally been changed .
Facebook @-@ Member Lo@@ vell Francis , who have a Council meeting in the Education Ministry , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary mis@@ erie needed that has gr@@ inding the core of the thing , but know what ? the marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now , and that is almost any price worth .
while A@@ bel Jackson of opinion was , it &apos;s definitely long enough to manage the practice was Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public Status Update on Facebook from Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which said , &quot; suggest@@ ing news !
the sp@@ ic@@ etz has been decided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ low Mut@@ ota , which listened to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group that said quite openly about how important the adoption of the law were , noted :
the mar@@ qu@@ iring age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent from the religious of the 18 years .
the draft of the notification obligation was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
the House of Represent@@ atives are 41 members and they were present at the voting age 35 during the vote .
all MEPs were agreed to vote for the law .
the children &apos;s @-@ toe is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ ren@@ ri@@ dent @-@ abuse .
many thanks to all the activists that have fo@@ stered him out .
Con@@ gr@@ ats .
a thanks to our members .
but a possible hook is indicated in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aja , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u @-@ Organisation of the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aja has proclaimed his intention to undertake stra@@ igh@@ tened steps , should the law be passed and he seems to rede@@ em his promise .
while the General State of Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advocate of the law , meant that it would be legitimate if Mahar@@ aj would want to go against the law , most social media users , one would approach the debate on the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed in front of :
dear Sat , when we , instead of holding the discussion so general , in a way that would have only panic and poverty , when we would say the state to protect our daughters above that they may be beneficial to them , that they may be beneficial to them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial approach to the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children &apos;s before in different grad@@ ations are legal or still the norm continues , although there are laws they sub@@ ordin@@ ate them .

by the mir@@ rors of websites , Turkish users can look at Wikipedia @-@ content
the English @-@ language Wikipedia @-@ site was presented on January 18 , 2012 , regarding the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and PI@@ PA copyright legislation in the USA , internationally l@@ unk@@ ed .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month Turkey witn@@ essed the popular and crow@@ ds@@ ourcing principle based enc@@ ycl@@ op@@ edia Wikipedia .
day after day , more evident how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porter and fans of TV @-@ cir@@ cuits to be opposed to the lock@@ out .
although many en@@ gene@@ tically modified Internet users are used to use@@ able tools for block websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article published by the New York Times on the fact that Turkey has the third largest V@@ PN emb@@ lance of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been arti@@ cul@@ ated by Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society on Har@@ vard University , will find regular block@@ ages of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
to China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world , when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be locked there are now several Mir@@ r@@ or@@ pages ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
one solution came from IP@@ FS ( Inter@@ fac@@ tion File System ) as the platform for all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centr@@ alised pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator PC connections ) which does not base itself on the system of domains .
the content is available in spite of the legal pro@@ hibition .
in a Blog@@ post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we &apos;ve heard the news ( about the block@@ age of Wikipedia ) , we put everything on it , snap@@ shots of Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed manner .
this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia sites , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wiki@@ pedi@@ a.org .
IP@@ FS was also found that this step was performed independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only scre@@ enshots and no li@@ ve@@ - or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent@@ ing the sper@@ re .
Crist@@ ian Con@@ sonn@@ i by Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a Mir@@ r@@ or@@ page of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to get similar mi@@ r@@ or@@ pages , when in the particular country Wikipedia is being locked .

essentially the server re@@ dire@@ cts the request to the right Wikipedia @-@ site so that it &apos;s possible to see the contents of Wikipedia yourself then when they are locked in Turkey .

the motiv@@ ate him to carry him a camera with yourself and try to pre@@ ach the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nept@@ une seems to bring to the international stage as an animal world .
and his hom@@ etown directly next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering it the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that ste@@ er the attention of Nept@@ une world .
he described on fac@@ ebook as it helps him this first class position in his work :
I live on the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photograph@@ ers ! !
I turned straight back home when suddenly Nav@@ ar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) had invited me . he had received a call from my father , that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a leop@@ ard .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran out with my camera and stayed in a few minutes .
my father watched it and showed me the place on the other side , where the leop@@ ard was located and I immediately began to cr@@ ack pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar is aiming to work with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as sc@@ ary about what they look like .

also , due to the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the bu@@ ff were suddenly appeared . he immediately drew us , we see ourselves and he star@@ struck me through the s@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar is the logo &quot; I click for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I cli@@ cked for environmental protection ) on his pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese and wild animals is not always easy .
he wa@@ ited 22 days long , and lived mostly in a tent in order to take a tiger in the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings from Ot@@ ters . until 12 days , it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect picture of birds , who live close to the tourist accommodation .

this entry was dra@@ fted by Kay@@ ona@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community @-@ organization from India .
a revised version was published here as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid having the greatest care , the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use an pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Prad@@ esh give women that they respect the social pressure to respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should consider the norm to receive this practice in life .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto became condem@@ ns from the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a by a hy@@ par@@ al , and come across from her family and the village community , having raised a bud@@ ding relationship with name .
the tradition of their wives also did not name by name , is also spread among men . however , they have far less chance to fear , if all , in fact , they should not dimin@@ ished this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health professionals , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and became very quickly the main issue of the city .
it is a place just for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the int@@ ric@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs that exists in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and is committed to the dism@@ ant@@ ling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ an has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera in the un@@ cover of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected , and manages these clubs .
it reported on how these clubs are created a safe place for these women , and at the same time they were made towards the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of the change .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini in her discussion showed , acted by women who did not name their hus@@ bands in the name .
she decided on this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify with .
speaking the name of their sp@@ ouses is a bread , which they all sustain fully paid and never question@@ ed .
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition asser@@ ts that a woman respected her husband and wishes him long life .
a woman who does not die this is considered a list , as a woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it up to this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband at home , at home , at home as it does .
she showed the video of the discussion about her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law , and my husband has long been silent , after the video was over .
Pra@@ k@@ ash my husband , turned to me and said , I shall call him from now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed it is a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Prad@@ esh .
after the vide@@ o@@ projection , the women were looking for discussion with an exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked everyone , &quot; If we could not tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean to not respect us ?
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married since 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their sp@@ ouses over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine from the village of Wal@@ he to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the break@@ age of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which women married the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise just stood before ; another decided to let him out the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ alin rush to have broken with an ancient bread , the women decided that they could actually try at home to name their hus@@ bands in the name .
and they stopped their word .
in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , and asked what ideas she put in his head : his wife could not stop his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she grew ten@@ se , she got afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband at a participant was less obvious and the situation was art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reported on how women tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead , which indicates the Hus@@ est@@ atus :
why do women only need to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red spot if he did .
he laughs , and I listened to him , to carry him .
the other women have not completely heard of this , but mean , they are now in a better position , to choose to give it in some days not to bear .
for many women the discussion is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are doing a trip with any discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women make sure who could hear what could hear &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and spoken about things that they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
for so many years I have been working on these issues for so many years and yet I have spoken about some things such as our ident@@ ities to our adul@@ th@@ ood , nor ever speaking .
it feels great to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is linked to clothing .
some women in the group have carried only sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most it &apos;s okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ine @-@ cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a tro@@ users , wearing ; they have not been dre@@ amed .
after much contro@@ vers@@ y and discussion about the advantages of their own wardrobe , mor@@ als connected to the Sar@@ is and much more , sh@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ te Roh@@ ini its own pair of tas ( Upper hem@@ den ) into a panel , so that women could carry them .
next they have decided now to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can carry Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is certain that they will do it .
on the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion club , I have already changed something , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things get slowly into roles :
we have only made small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then listened to the name of her husband &apos;s name .
some , including me , make it even , but only if they are alone and not any other family members here are .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the eil@@ ing around more freedom of movement or their own wardrobe - at the end of a hard to navigate .
by giving each other self confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explained :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each one of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and other people about what we talk about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably not recently made .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the fall of the det@@ ention Chinese dis@@ si@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o had attracted attention in the international community , after his lawyer announced the end of June that he has been sent to hospital for liver cancer in the final stage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o which calls on democratic reforms in China . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Department in China referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and a speaker tells , he did not consider it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , China still receives views from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or give him a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely eliminated .
Hong Kong Free Press has put some reactions from abroad .
united nations
Zei@@ d Ra @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the high command@@ ar of the United Nations for Human Rights , met with the end of June Chinese official to discuss the fall of Li@@ u .
but a spokes@@ man rejected , however , to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to facilitate treatment abroad .
Norway of Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister in Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway has been best@@ owed , after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian Government dis@@ ks that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were repeated until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the Sal@@ oon drove back to China , since the exports have been blocked since 2010 .
once the message had spread that Li@@ u was seriously engaged , the Nobel Peace Committee brought his hope for an unconditional release to an unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his price in Oslo .
due to his det@@ ention he was not able to uph@@ old his price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was invited to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house ar@@ rest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the peak diplom@@ a of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , made China also called for the release of Li@@ us , as she divided into a declaration on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all limitations of Mr Li@@ us wife as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
de . USA
us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad said that the Americans said &quot; him that he has the opportunity of treatment abroad , so that it may help him with his genre . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of US message in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the message agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the message sent to the Chinese authorities to release their message not only Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house ar@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the challenge of the US Embassy attracted an angry response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of State , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interv@@ ene and ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple :
protection and freedom such as free access and access to the medical care of his choices on which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal systems as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have just introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally , so that he can follow himself in proper medical treatment . ht@@ tp : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government at Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needed , and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg .
previously diplomatic sources were reported in Beijing of the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns , whether the vort@@ ex could be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by Li@@ u the visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um urged China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to turn away from his family .
Li@@ us An@@ walt i told AF@@ P previously , that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day but the police have always kept the room in the hospital and that it is Li@@ u not allowed to speak and contact someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um is on :
Canada asks China to stand up its international human rights violations , including freedom of expression , preserving and release them in the exercise of these rights .
France
France &apos;s State Department called for China in a statement on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all treatments that he , regardless of where , needed . additionally , his wife and family may have contact to him .
although the F@@ ack Sender f info reported that the French Government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Foreign Ministry known that there is no further information , if France will finally record him .
Taiwan on Taiwan
the Council of the Federal Republic of Taiwan in Taiwan , called on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show a greater tolerance to those who are peaceful means of fighting for political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ w@@ anese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party , China also called on to allow the sick Li@@ u to let themselves be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very concerned in a statement on 28 June by Li@@ u , that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it &apos;s my faith that the initiatives he took and for whom he was strictly pun@@ ished to have led to a harmon@@ ious , more stable and aff@@ lu@@ ent China , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world .
I felt very moved and encouraged to me when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected people , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the charter of 08 signed , which stands for democracy , liberty and the rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem sil@@ ly since Singapore is recognized on an international level as an independent state .
but according to the judicial Minister K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be considered to be a city .
this remark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osph@@ ere .
during the meeting on a meeting of the International branch of the Law@@ yers &apos; Association of the State New York , the Ministers agreed that many people critic@@ ized the domin@@ ance of the only political party in Singapore since they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supported Singapore should be considered as a city .
... nobody has question@@ ed whether new York was a democracy ...
this is because most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a land .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the judicial Minister , &quot; to rot@@ ate the logic to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian practice of power in Singapore .
and then , after all of our efforts and sacrific@@ es to create this valuable land , we say that we will not eventually be a country .
it seemed so vul@@ gar , it had the s@@ emb@@ lance of a flight from the responsibilities , a must breach .
Singapore , if you are not my country , then is it then ?
the reasons behind Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , given the first appeared , in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore and cities should be compared to Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are led to a party permanently . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the topic , then again the good old ly@@ re of the author@@ it@@ arian makers have to be the pre @-@ Democrats leave the twi@@ sted logic as it fits better to its power .
in the end of the last week of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , they were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our J@@ udi@@ k@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
corresponding questions tar@@ ed with non @-@ responses to rational style .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am to clarify his opinion , since they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore was not a country , but a city , so the country is part of our town ...
in short , I do not understand anything .
I would be very thankful when our wer@@ ed K Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am the strain on himself would be clar@@ ified that point where he was paid up to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by sending his comment on the blog , he pointed out to read the full signature of the conference , so that it could be better understood to understand the context of the statements made by Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the e @-@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore was more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said why the elections in Singapore would be so un@@ equi@@ voc@@ al even if we were looking forward to free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is engaged in Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party in decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously does not refer to this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who is acting as a leader of a growing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ian statement .
I am talking about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore , very embarrass@@ ed ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and to the members of the old Gar@@ de which I expect - whether I agree with them or not , but this is another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes that he really believes and is aware of what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review explo@@ res the gu@@ arding of Shan@@ cour@@ g@@ ams of Arg@@ um@@ ers :
does Mr Shan@@ gr@@ am &quot; committed a mistake &quot; or was it a fre@@ el@@ scher speaker ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are only viewed as an independent and sovereig@@ n state ?
if not , in which country the sovereig@@ n rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the government design , the statements made by Mr Shan@@ gr@@ am are more serious .
why does the Lon@@ av@@ aries feel of their military service , they defend only their city but not their country ?
whom does our Prime Minister pay b@@ ills ?
what is the value of our pink @-@ certificate ?
is we the citizens of a country , or the inhabitants of a city ?
, the magazine Jour@@ ney of a decade to the affir@@ mation , Singapore is and has always been a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this set seems to have become so anno@@ yed for many days ...
nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we always were a city .
we have always been a city / islands state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian n@@ ed flan@@ ders .
screens@@ hot of a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices also asked his speakers : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect about your home country or home country ?
their answers will be published here as part of a continuous sequence , with the rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world and to be revealed to another fac@@ et .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question I am asked most about Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you American ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I am living again and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation is held , it is considered to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ or by giving personal questions .
to my clar@@ ion then usually follow the default response : &quot; Oh , Ro@@ cky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans cook maybe in@@ war@@ dly against war@@ dly when they are held for Americans , but uns@@ ett@@ led me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that is different to us of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag well visible at their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
it was like I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - Donald Tr@@ ump , ahead of the march in Iraq and September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always worn small oc@@ eros @-@ leaves at their luggage to differenti@@ ate themselves from their amer@@ ican neighbors .
we have a free health care !
with us there is no weapons !
Equ@@ al E@@ hen are legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ use &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is supposed to be considered as the toler@@ ant country of ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends , which I ad@@ mi@@ red .
nothing would make me profit if one would also conf@@ use me with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
firstly : being called &quot; nice &quot; to be said to be in essence - as the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; ( who has one &apos;s own Canadian double ) .
if Canada were really a nation full of people like N@@ ed flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has .
there are no no@@ oks and edges , nothing that you can encounter .
inno@@ cu@@ ous , means to be in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no attention to earn .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that pass around one .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , a main bone of the Canadian is .
we tend to care for our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; perhaps simply cool polit@@ eness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans do not talk often across the fence with the neighbors .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I have now uni@@ fy with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Just@@ in Tru@@ deau die Stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; our Prime Minister has made Canada straight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band has released a music video , which took the Jun@@ ta par@@ ades , which took the power in 2014 and , despite their promise , the civil government , continues to restore the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det girl ) of the band tattoo Col@@ our describes a young man who tells them about the rules he makes his girlfriend .
although not expressly politically , the music video refers directly to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was har@@ med by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to song was a great success .
only within the first three days it was shared on Facebook high up@@ loaded video 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8.@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month even the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The dict@@ ator has been blocked in Thailand after a group of activists representing the public to watch this video .
the video can interpret as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular how it beha@@ ves with the position of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
look at once these recordings of the video , which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand has been pursuing in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may relate to the dra@@ stic section of 44 of the pro@@ visional constitution , which gives the com@@ mander @-@ owner of the host @-@ making @-@ decision making important national issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians , and other persons , who are viewed from the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to accept activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit has been decorated in the army to super@@ vised the online content and those individuals to be car@@ ded , the monarchy will be prosec@@ uted , will be prosec@@ uted .
Thailand sets a stri@@ pes against &quot; harvest Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ ä@@ ts@@ aber ) .
on 20 May 2014 , a war was launched in Thailand .
two days later it came to a put@@ sch of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to be prosec@@ uted , their decision is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ti@@ ers , although security officer they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax claims .
in the video even shown how people will be tos@@ sed in a black tank , before going into an interpre@@ ting one another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison , because they supp@@ os@@ edly created &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and internet pages will be used for long periods of adhesi@@ on , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band , who took the Sal@@ ut out of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; who was already being used by coup opponents during the protests 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the vul@@ ture towns in the eastern part of the east .

the post @-@ war company is very slowly reco@@ vering in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the region of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has passed over 20 years since the Georgian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ hic war was officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the deser@@ ted villages of the Northern District in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ Chil@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
different ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , de@@ preci@@ pice , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians were living and worked as hard times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the largest part of Russians and shr@@ ases are living in the area .
such settlements are also known as viol@@ as host@@ ages .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived , today , there are only a few hundred people in these spirit @-@ cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 the total population of the district population was 16,@@ 000 people after having lost over a decade .
in 1989 about 45@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it all is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s came to be called the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas are symbo@@ lic@@ ally symbo@@ lic@@ ally and the devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling apart and quite rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native old man .
he begins a conversation and it falls to him difficult to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it all is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why talk ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
there were church centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that serve all of the community .
now there is only paved road with feder@@ ated spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and contributed their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have meanwhile abandoned the district .
in the Gei@@ ster@@ stadt D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , there are approximately fifty residents .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the chron@@ ology of K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ka , which can accommodate one or two families , one can recognize at the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
as she re@@ discover me with the camera in his hand , they immediately move back .
&quot; our mother banned us so we photograph ourselves , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is simply forbidden to us , that is all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers to their girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small tur@@ quoise mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence farming ( cultivation of land products for own needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable @-@ growing .
it is difficult to get back home rounds .
the district management provides free candles and bread for the villages .

about ten years ago an older woman moved to the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to jun@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her older daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina does not leave from Ab@@ b@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will be forever in Ab@@ b@@ asia , &quot; she tells them .
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial support from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she instead supports her young grand@@ children .
Gal@@ inas monthly rates are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you do not have a vegetable garden or house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; is it too .
T@@ ante G@@ alya tells you and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit us .
but we cannot do this ever - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neigh@@ bor appear on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ alya to meet you . &apos; You said we could dism@@ ant@@ te zu@@ cch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what is going to happen but we will generate zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
I had a conversation with her husband and the five shared children in their house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she remembered the village life before the war .
in spite of their relatives , that live in Central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ asia just collap@@ sed ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently purchased land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative det@@ ention town in Ab@@ b@@ asia ) .
we want to build a house there , but it will still take something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it explains it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets for each child about $ 9 children &apos;s money .
her husband works in the cab@@ al .
the young family has its own farm .
close to the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as Kindergarten was once close , they maintain pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
it tells us that at first it was a very anxi@@ ous situation when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time she lost her en@@ vi@@ ability .

&quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or a few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact , it has more to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was little work and everyone lived like it was right .
I remember each day as the city and the war were once . &quot;
as our conversation ends the end , a small boy bur@@ ns to us over .
he runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies from the window and another boy wr@@ inkl@@ es behind him .
he plays with the ball , who then over@@ lt the hill .
a group of children now tr@@ itting the ball .
while they run , some of them throw them stones at the falling building .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which care for dish@@ on@@ eness in their life .

in Mexico &quot; M@@ om Africa &quot; migrants at her long journey
Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Br@@ ack was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org .
on the road of migrants to cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the mex@@ ican city of A@@ isl@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ ik@@ an@@ erin , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink cor@@ ne@@ sts and gold @-@ coloured ear@@ rings in t@@ ed@@ dy@@ b@@ ular form .
it is called Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born there in Tap@@ ach@@ ula . nevertheless , they know a lot under the name of Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) become a destination of Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ an who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with deposit , to@@ ast@@ ing walls and beds made of metal .
in the first @-@ room there is a par@@ rot in a c@@ age .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an immigrants come here .
sometimes , Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez comes the people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept on map .
it does not want anyone to decline .
she also helps them and takes them to the hospital when they are sick , they bu@@ ys them medication that they can not pay them , they mass@@ aged them with a Bal@@ m made by the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable nickname for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) posi@@ ed with Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
foto : Amy Br@@ ack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao gets with his sister to get to Boston to get there her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , however it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then pull toward the north .
the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he says that the Ha@@ iti@@ an and the Afri@@ cans often travel together to the distance and that , Afri@@ kaner already talk on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance , and has worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world .
when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he has started his journey to the United States .
he has been guest at Mama Africa for months now : he sold SIM cards to save the necessary money to purchase the ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we will never go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respond to smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez told her guests to send her often text messages if they went away to kiss her or to report her about the course of their journey .
it declar@@ es that her Christian faith is the stren@@ ght of her work .
she does not know much about Africa but their guests have brought them to cro@@ issants like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very popular here but it is not the only fun@@ fair hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
we visited this winter in Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family in their little house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the Bu@@ ac@@ et will be sold to numerous African migrants at a cost .
he started to help them get a reasonable price then he offered them his house for one dollar the night offered .
for the moment there are 25 people mostly Ha@@ iti@@ an .
some sleep on blan@@ kets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchenette outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explained that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they experience .
I crossed the border via the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived three years , he was directed after a raid on his work place from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he had escap@@ ed with his wife and three children who wanted money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and one unknown , an all @-@ inclusive , has offered to it its roof .
some months later the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa is all back crowded .
in the courses , the passengers consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has given 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about her house is full , but it is also nost@@ al@@ gic , because of those who went away .
like a respec@@ table grand@@ mother flo@@ ed her in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair@@ care that has made her a manifestation , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and old .
they laughs , while they rehear@@ sed them in short .
Ya &apos;s fu@@ eron , &quot; they repeat each time . &quot; You have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang &apos;s inhabitants are forced to install on its mobile phones .
a check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter @-@ User ...
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the Handy @-@ users at the Tian@@ shan District of the City of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile phone notification , in which it indicates the District government , a surveillance app called Jing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hin@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is supposed to obtain access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities may also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women in the autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they had installed shortly after they had installed the app , news with a private we@@ aker group .
in the communication of the police , the app was standing and monitor the sources and the distribution paths of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
Jing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
Jing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with System @-@ Categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is the block@@ age of porno@@ graphic web sites , of online fraud , Tro@@ jan and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to control their own home network .
this app with the filter for min@@ ors should help the children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; government actors or even h@@ acker can manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or to ste@@ al from it .
this implementation is consistent with other measures to take control of digital activities in this region .
while announ@@ cements about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often d@@ ull for those who live in distant , pressing ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ cont@@ ent@@ ment in conflict zones , the authorities often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ e@@ em@@ ian Internet dis@@ cir@@ cuits .
das auf Twitter based media @-@ Out@@ let &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( here@@ with ) , the cen@@ sored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where he checked the inhabitants in@@ discrimin@@ ately whether they had the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian are sure people use the official Jing@@ shan App .
a mobile not@@ i@@ fications required that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have comp@@ elled people to use appliances needed for older people .
this is a form of cap@@ tivity through the ber@@ wach@@ ung technology .
we are back in ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from the mainland China &quot; ( res@@ umes 中@@ 国@@ 語 ) also published a Jing@@ shan product description , out of which software is able to up@@ lift the password from a Windows operating system , and thus receives unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .

sleep or death , part 1 : all sh@@ outs after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane illustr@@ ates his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and imagine that you &apos;re all alone in a place where all are most important .
everything has gradually dis@@ solved and a truth is revealed , which is clearly recogni@@ zable , both from inside and outside .
one that makes their name all honour .
one which has turned down into a list of feelings and expres@@ sions , which allow no met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when you see the reality back and you behind the scenes - beyond the action , the beautiful scenes and the performer - transform the characters into being of flesh and blood , and all sh@@ outs after death .
all doubts dis@@ solve in R@@ auch , and you become aware of your existence , even though the earth turns on the axis of the disaster . you will realise that you are caught up here between the walls that your parents , and in front of them your grand@@ parents , stone built up stone .
they left me and my Father three times , but this doesn &apos;t yet come so that I mean &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the boss of the security services , it formed - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he demonstrated his power over us by demonstr@@ ating even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we have known .
five teenagers were das@@ hed during a peaceful protests as we@@ ed from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it came from , so that the city sh@@ reds the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Allah Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all neighborhood co@@ v@@ eted , only my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ im@@ los , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that came up into the arter@@ ies with state safety @-@ organisms and their compli@@ ces .
in the third night the things had cal@@ med down , after the power supply in the neighborhood was stopped .
I broke the silence by doing several times &quot; All@@ ahu &quot; Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house , cri@@ ed out .
I heard my voice by the silence re@@ lu@@ ct@@ antly .
a few minutes later some of my friends were bra@@ ve enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , real friends opened to me ; we con@@ feder@@ ate us to a grand image that filled my expectations completely and fully .
in such a moment you are aware that you liber@@ ated the spirit from the lamp , but you simply are not in the t@@ ing@@ est .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet with the military security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid down on .
then I learned that : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low swal@@ low - nothing can bring you back your voice after giving them the whole way up to the office of the safety service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Ober@@ st gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
the colon@@ el starts to speak : &quot; let me hear , as you &apos; Allah Ak@@ bar &apos; is scre@@ ams , or you are only then bra@@ ve enough to scre@@ am if we are not close by . &quot;
his bright @-@ filled eyes were looking forward to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really m@@ our@@ n what to look into the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
maybe it was in my Tor@@ u@@ ity , van@@ ity , perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure of my job than I said , &quot; I did not think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I never ceased to look into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fat@@ ale consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t shy back from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary and his father the same with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father the same with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the st@@ ench of the sentence lies before me today in the nose .
he was sentenced to a syndrome , &quot; a spiritual torture , which I was exposed to a monthly .
I scre@@ ams the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I do with myself .
then again through the yard and into the second office that leads through a gang to the individual cells .
I took all the details exactly before I support the room .
otherwise , this time they have probably shared a larger cell .
I must share it with only one other prisoners and may immediately put me in motion without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I attacked on an old @-@ proven communication method : to beat the f@@ ist on the wall .
I learned that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; awakening . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he didn &apos;t answer me at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it appears in none of the surrounding cells a respec@@ table middle aged man , who sees me similarly and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the perfect darkness , no distinctive face can be seen in me , and doctors are not there ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice is similar to what it sounds ? &quot;
all the answers is connected to its existence .
perhaps he was put into one of the big cells .
maybe he will immediately hear .
the investig@@ ator had in@@ sured to me they would not leave him if I stay .
fan .
I would have had a bir@@ d@@ ull in order to disp@@ el all these cro@@ ws , who lab@@ eling themselves in the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be at least 10 a.m. ; always at this time the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens up .
I was always convinced that black was the color of the promise , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ ast@@ ing to the 13th S@@ ure of Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; you are here to hear . &quot;
thus the secret was paraly@@ sed : to protect the state of security before us and prevent the s@@ lan@@ der and terrorists in us , they talk in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ches dial@@ ect - hence they played their denomin@@ ation@@ on@@ ous ground@@ ing card and gathered the narrow eye @-@ field of their view .
this is not a house , this is not a land ; it is a cur@@ se that call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their sound into a hero .
I looked after the hear@@ ings and meet in Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and st@@ ems man ; at least he comes up with me .
he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , &quot; despite the facial expres@@ sions : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join those di@@ edi@@ ve and protest to demonstrations that will soon find an end soon . &quot;
I did not answer .
I acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to , not to answer .
I can truly say more precisely when ins@@ ults and beats after a friendly conversation have become an ordinary communication instrument .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me told me that I had to get used to be pun@@ ished , pun@@ ished although I did nothing to earn these punishment .
to serve in all its diversity .
his command is to te@@ ar me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this lov@@ ingly &quot; gest@@ ion . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably comes out of the clo@@ aks .
your hen are rejo@@ iced on your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him and you cannot with@@ hold your cry .
my hor@@ ror they fell not enough , why they re@@ plac@@ ate the pipe through a cable .
during my first lap , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked earlier as a gar@@ bage dump , or if that belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had four cables up to each other to present ourselves from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within one single hour three of them dis@@ regarded itself three of them while still was on the line .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I listened to scre@@ am .
the ex@@ ecu@@ tion@@ er re@@ marked the cooling and found no favour of a favor , which is why he attacked as a neigh@@ bor to an electric invited rod .
flow through my entire body , enough to provide my entire quarter .
my semi @-@ bare body that lay out on the ground was the perfect electric gli@@ der .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
it must have been like midnight .
I decided to go back sleeping again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours left , which came to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the bri@@ ghtness meets the room &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with dir , ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I responded with the voice of a exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my master , my father has to worry fri@@ ght@@ ful concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be silent and Bewe@@ g dich , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they always had me released .
where do they guide me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ an Rap@@ e Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smok@@ es a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
the photo was taken from A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends the bulk of his time inside ; sometimes he sh@@ red@@ ded to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , every time and again to his couch .
but what you can depend is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine be@@ amed lips .
he lives on the top of his family house , which had listened to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had to fle@@ e from her village in Palestine to fle@@ e from her village in Palestine ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who simultaneously faced the conservative majority and question@@ ed its old @-@ proven opinions about gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and Rap@@ id .
with his music , who often deals with topics like Oriental , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities that reach Damascus in Syria through to San@@ aa in Y@@ emen .
with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as a person who is not restricted in his thinking , and he can sympath@@ ize according to its own statement with the people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , which Y@@ emen , Syria and Libya .
even if he isn &apos;t open it openly , it swe@@ eps up against the US foreign policy a special incl@@ ination .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b regards his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b doesn &apos;t believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , something with its identity as a &quot; Palestinian fle@@ d@@ eter of the second generation &quot; - he said to himself even if he was born in Jordan and never was in Palestine until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own life circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I &apos;m a man , &quot; while in water hol@@ lowed Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan . in this time , it is set for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset .
the j@@ ord@@ an law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking through ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ ing called Jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the lu@@ sures of the warm coffee and the s@@ wa@@ ders of the sick @-@ cigar@@ ette in the nose is primarily of freedom .
sometimes though Jordan is feeling like a prison in the open sky , especially when looking into neighbouring countries .
from therefore , it is easy to do basic things - just as to drink in public during Ram@@ adan water - in order to land not in prison .
recently , the internal Ministry of Jord@@ ani@@ ens received a performance of the band Mas@@ h@@ rou &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some parliamentary groups who support the Islamic Action Front - the j@@ ord@@ an branch of the Muslim Br@@ otherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osex@@ ual front@@ al k@@ ang@@ ular Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradi@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert .
the MP and former press spokes@@ woman in the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert &quot; just &quot; was cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the company .
many pret@@ end to claim the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world , be more dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m that question@@ ed the old proven legitimacy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes in the entire region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , Mas@@ h@@ rou &quot; Lei@@ la the j@@ ord@@ yan people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which continues to apply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement might probably not be so sil@@ ken , Rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually a clear and clear reality in Jordan , which clearly appears to appear in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional ven@@ ch@@ tern@@ or@@ men to Lei@@ be by having his vision of the fate of Arab women to have vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the image shows the sk@@ elet@@ on of a apparently Dutch un@@ well @-@ known woman , whose arms and legs stretches up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who should really trust them .
in the past few years , the number of &apos; hon@@ or@@ ous mor@@ de &apos; has grown dramatically - the in@@ official out@@ ward .
human Rights Watch showed its peak in 2016 . however , the number of hon@@ oring in 2016 reached its peak ; however , there is still more fri@@ ghtening that Jordan &apos;s institutional infrastructure were lacking in order to support women who tried victims of mur@@ dered or domestic violence .
according to a law on the break@@ able control of the year 1954 women , who are exposed to the threat of in@@ family violence , &quot; to in@@ definitely be held in prison , &quot; and for their liberation is often a long @-@ long bureaucr@@ atic effort and the guarantee of family needed that the woman has nothing to happen .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known to do not shy away from themes made in his country long as tab@@ u .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b cont@@ ests that his work is politically , ad@@ mits that he is his music , that is full of explicit ass@@ essm@@ ents on sexuality , freedom and expression , cannot part from politics .
&quot; I kom@@ m out of the Middle East , Man .
I was campa@@ ign@@ ed to politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus was on poverty .
the list of the songs , which are politically politically , can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated many times :
&quot; you are free , and anyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , Het@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he not@@ ices that hardly any one speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals still have been heavily cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b launched an interview for the popular Japanese tide programme Ro@@ ya , to later notice that his comments were tor@@ n out of the context , dist@@ orted and his opinion were cen@@ sored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube it has been up@@ loaded without Buck@@ le , but only has a processed version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b ac@@ quires H@@ d@@ ai@@ b open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that Int@@ ol@@ intoler@@ ance is not talking about homosexu@@ als .
he men@@ tions Abu nuclear , a poet of the eigh@@ th century , which still remained in memory , thanks to its hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b wonders : if Abu nuclear , who later should work once on behalf of the calibr@@ ation , in the eigh@@ th century openly were able to write homosexu@@ ality , why is Jord@@ an@@ ier not ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ rou &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new any more , that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices will be sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ an news was firm several former government officials and members of the teacher &apos;s association , with the reason they had vo@@ iced on comments in social media with the problems that are deeply rooted with the deep in the country .
given the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs in view , only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to indu@@ ce a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ier .
for him , progress is a continuous giving and taking . Jordan has now re@@ vered for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - there is H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , bed@@ ak and inner changes . it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an society .
finally , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also , from an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he dreams not only dreams of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to discover &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region is going through music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bom@@ bs , ext@@ ingu@@ ished and artificial nature . at least he hopes that .
until the time has come , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to follow and accordingly there is resistance .

Neb@@ o in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ bs are as fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta festivals .
one assumed that it is a variant of Tan@@ gi@@ ata Festivals which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of to@@ podium . another theory under@@ lines that the festiv@@ ities , the drums and dancing sh@@ ines over more than one thousand years ago and origin@@ ating from a time when the arm@@ ies of the West in the northeast mar@@ ched to force the indigenous people of the region , the em@@ ishi to force into its kne@@ es .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to catch a few great seating , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . )
I have been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two ball@@ ers are currently visible .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true one - and thus a stunning way to spend their summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high hi@@ ring was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

sel@@ dom , external appearance and body care were as important as in this story , because they help keep away from the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ sty@@ ling .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us principal port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where road @-@ consuming and illegal drugs are daily .
one in April 2017 survey showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region was not safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other middle and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the fallen styles of famous sports , such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more norm@@ alities into the experienced hands of hair@@ styles that can form these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the un@@ parall@@ eled demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the outer limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hairdres@@ sers &quot; bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there are experts with each other to show , who can create from them the ec@@ centric layers on how to see in the following video ( further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to spend young people going to di@@ p their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of receiving a training in hair@@ dressing tools that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered do@@ zens of young people saw that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the beginning of March , and reported on some of their achievements :
in 1995 we were the only professional school in the municipality and the district , where we are very proud , because from love to the children we have built this education community .
Colombia : Lov@@ ing on gu@@ err@@ illas

use with friendly permission .
the following article is the working version of the Beit@@ rag@@ s &quot; Liebes@@ bot@@ her@@ ing in Guer@@ ill@@ ak@@ ä@@ mpfer , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea after T@@ wel@@ ve .
this article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not much more important , people who feel oppressed you to accom@@ od@@ ate his affection ?
it is precisely this question that the two young Colom@@ bian activists from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os of the Young @-@ Youth Foundation is no longer of the head and inspired it to the campaign Cart@@ as por la Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ li@@ ación ( Let@@ ters on reconciliation ) , the young people to leave gu@@ err@@ illas from emerging letters .
just recently , their land was a historic event , and they wanted to contribute their part to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa com@@ for@@ ce@@ F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
international was considered the sign of peace treaty than so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
but in front of the Colom@@ bian@@ Woman , there is a long way to get rid of a real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who have been exposed to illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war @-@ rh@@ et@@ oric , and around the clock their weapons have been carried out in their lives , must now be integrated into the life as civilians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colom@@ bian company in turn , adapted to life in continuous fear and in some cases deep hat@@ red against gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now take in their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian people would have to collaborate and would have to help in integration process .
and that is exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love @-@ party to former gu@@ err@@ illa @-@ fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for any former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters - which should then be handed over to personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea of reconciliation for reconciliation created at the world summit of Nobel Peace Prize winner who took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there were Leonardo and Crist@@ ian the opportunity to speak short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we love the people we love , on Valentine &apos;s thousands of love letters , but those forgot they need much unnecessary .
he plane , he told he continued to share his love with people this year , which took the most urgent commitments .
thus , the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , which now find their place in society and to show up a new life . &apos; letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is prepared to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
up to now , more than 2000 letters were gathered in the framework of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought that anyone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March at any of the O@@ don@@ o region in the region Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on March 19 .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo of the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art travelled to the camp in order to transfer the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC were on how they had done it in the past to counter@@ act the commands of their leaders .
but this time they received no prec@@ ep@@ ts , but letters of inf@@ est@@ ing of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told the policy knowledge stud@@ ded Manuela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a staff of the govern@@ or of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience like :
after we had passed the letters , a former fighters took me through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa com@@ bat@@ ants .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of cottage , in which the gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ d@@ amper live ) saw , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa bar@@ ber who wrote something .
I had scar@@ ed to go down , because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL game @-@ thro@@ wer , a mort@@ al weapon in the thorn berry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I said to him anyway , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what are they doing just ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I rep@@ lied to a letter that somebody has written me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never before in my life , someone has written something such a nice one , so I sincer@@ ely responded to that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I suddenly had the tears of the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ g@@ ged him quite firm and sat down next to the pom@@ eg@@ ate .
perhaps he was tired too , was tired of being all the years of the faithful companion of this c@@ ality , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC , was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of fam@@ ine . &quot; I never thought that someone would give me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is outside a society that is waiting with open arms to us .
up to now I only learned how to handle weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace is re@@ igns , I can learn a lot of things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new votes
finally , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came to a discussion round .
the students were all raised as a war and the F@@ ARC started in sec@@ rec@@ y .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC are the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years we have experienced how the social in@@ justice on the whole of the Colum@@ bian people have eff@@ ected . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to making the society in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this size , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
to hear these people who have never had heard before and no election was right , and to realize that people who are often seen as monsters and even hate , were also just people with beautiful feelings which were turned around by their living conditions and their environment were very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , does me sore .
but it com@@ for@@ ted me that all people - including those who have killed and so much damage , can bring us something and give a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the com@@ mander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the City of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colom@@ bian@@ Woman was made sure that after the dis@@ arm@@ ing of peace would reign .
but that is not the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as it gives inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are prepared to rise up arms and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we of the F@@ ARC are putting on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we give all the def@@ enders of peace - regardless of the race , religion or ideology - to rise above all that dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring victims , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend the life as the basis of existence , will face many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles in our way , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ osex@@ ual and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an region , are exposed to a wide variety of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ext@@ or@@ tion .
with terror , activists have experienced the coverage of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which is like a stu@@ amo@@ is of the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community depends not only on night .
OC Media had the chance to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared with us some of her experiences and talked with us about what happened in the Republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won several months ago the international head@@ lines after reports have been published , which reported the dis@@ appearances , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist in Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta . she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the dam@@ aging que@@ er men rep@@ ain@@ es and put them in secret pris@@ ons in the gun .
&quot; they have brought a mon@@ ster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood , she noticed that she was a woman in reality .
when she was grown up , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , which she moved to Moscow .
after a group of ch@@ att@@ ens received by the sex @-@ gentle of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened to Sabrina .
from fear around her life she moved to the USA last year .
Sabrina : I was acting as an volunteer assistant in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone took my help .
it was a friend of Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ woman who tasted in trouble .
it had no money , so I took it without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of mine . he sent them to his ch@@ y@@ fish friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , which can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
then they made the photos of my documents throughout the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was at present a few shopping links from my car returned from my car , I heard a Male &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I revol@@ ved , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing hur@@ ting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard one sentence , but this time on the Che@@ chen : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , du Sch@@ and@@ ra@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew the person not .
I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and wo@@ ke the end in the hospital again .
apparently , some women had got everything with and starting to scre@@ am .
the man was f@@ lown .
the women had a nur@@ se .
in the hospital I learned that I had two keywords in my right pul@@ mon@@ ary wings .
OC Media : in what ambul@@ ance were you put - in which the men or women of the women ?
Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name dr@@ on ; but the doctor for@@ f@@ ist and lay me among the women .
so I am very grateful .
when I read its name for the first time at its Bür@@ st@@ ard , I got it with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ cas@@ c@@ asi@@ an name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he is respectful to me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got dr@@ ones .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of an alpine m@@ our@@ se .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they demanded me to send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all that was a lie .
they asked absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by moving up without through the streets ; others wanted me to un@@ fold in official TV in Gros@@ ny , and say that I had@@ n &apos;t changed my sex that everything was just bad , and Photoshop .
I have body @-@ size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for her .
some older people spoke to my mother on the streets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a mon@@ ster to the world , not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay down a kn@@ it around the neck .
luckily the neighbors came and delivered them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and already a few hours later stood under the window a car with dark window plates and a number@@ ing plate with a 95 dr@@ on .
going on for the third time it was clear to me that there was something la@@ zy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my human rights @-@ made friends inspec@@ ted the number@@ ing shi@@ el@@ ds - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how did you stop ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for security reasons I want to do not disclose their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with her help I left the country , but then something un@@ belief .
I can still not grasp how it could be .
shortly before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought them without getting a reference , without a reference , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the gar@@ bage .
arrived and chec@@ ked to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stran@@ ger .
I put the SIM card into my cell phone .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you don &apos;t know , just because you left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you st@@ ang@@ st . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine ? !
this actually was my room @-@ number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , we are not talking about the gender equality , but that is a table topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some traditional k@@ au@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements are still in me .
so I wish I also , this se@@ el@@ astic barrier I cannot overcome .
I am always saying that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I actually give myself trouble to watch how the person remembered what they rec@@ alls from their past - thus to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who are d@@ ort@@ on ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the use , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke with someone who had dinner one and a half months in the gun .
he told me that during Ram@@ adan were not arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
possibly they are now focusing on family and relatives .
in order that I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced by blood Gen@@ ug@@ gl@@ ung .
OC Media : are now also still visible by men in these sec@@ rec@@ y ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says there would be not very many .
if , then especially those who have no rich relatives , or were dropped by its relatives in order to put the Cad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know , they will be held there so that they can present them later as terrorists .
say : should they be converted , one will show her body on television and claim , they would have attacked any village or military base .
to understand ?
as if these people were not simply gone , but specifically sub@@ ordin@@ ated to radic@@ alise itself .
OC Media : is this just a mut@@ ation or have you a source of this information ?
Sabrina : I have just met someone who was det@@ ained in the one and a half months in the gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown up .
there have been nothing new since then .
they have just taken them away .
and this so called Lord , this person was himself involved as these people were taken .
until now , they have not been presented as band@@ wid@@ ths , so far there have been no reports yet . we susp@@ ect that such actions are all possible .
why else could this people not be allowed to shave ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; know if these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already in the past ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sabrina : I always contributed my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think that in 2003 I was already familiar to Gros@@ ny as I lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was seen , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , then it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us back to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil democr@@ at@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ultimately it has thrown us back to the St@@ one@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were exhausted ; I had colored eyelashes , carried Rö@@ hr@@ je@@ ans and short lo@@ ops .
the safety of the sh@@ aria has never been cur@@ ved for me only one hair .
in front of the Russian theater in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every night , especially at weekends , a whole group of people met like me .
it was a small place where several ben@@ ches were standing , and the whole town knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phrase , K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ otte is not about the un@@ happiness of another . &quot;
you often say it to children if they are funny about sick .
OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you , because they imagined , you are sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they have never been insul@@ ted , never h@@ unted and never sm@@ itten .
OC Media : how long did this grace be covered ?
Sabrina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row joined the Plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he started talking to television about mor@@ ality .
he did not speak about us per se , but pre@@ dominant over the behavior of women .
nevertheless , you could feel the people in the city started to change .
who@@ ever had wr@@ apped and laugh@@ ed with suspic@@ ion on one time .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic was steadily improved .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t conden@@ sed a lot - 700 to 800 dollar per month are not much in the USA .
besides that I am still active as an activation .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize teac@@ re@@ ffs , mer@@ ges , I beg@@ ining them to hospital and help them to get Es@@ sen@@ sk@@ arten .
I don &apos;t see a p@@ enny for a long time .
I discovered these people themselves when I disp@@ ens@@ ed down shelter .
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : list an Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is Algeri@@ an .
thus nature , it has nothing at all to do with religion .
that is exactly the same as Tsch@@ etsch@@ enen , who want to know you with foam before the mouth , that there are no g@@ ols in them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dag@@ est@@ ors who have the cab@@ aret they have , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet there is it - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so I am unpleasant to hear what to hear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of them - practi@@ cing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ram@@ adan - live with men together .
do you know many thinking about hus@@ bands of men who love men , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a tru@@ ction .
these are two different things - two different types of sensation in order to be precise , different ways of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ash@@ amed for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry that I will get more personally here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I am not sad about it - I just know that I am myself .
local groups war@@ n before an increase of self @-@ murder within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab au@@ er@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty reduction within the native Arab population .
for the last months there has been a sharp rise in self @-@ murder .
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 question@@ ed the dist@@ ressing situation of the Arab Ah@@ l@@ az@@ i community in Iran which is shaped by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he sho@@ ok themselves to his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , the in@@ capacity for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video led on YouTube has held the moments after he appro@@ ached himself .
some people managed to clear the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ ín hospital in the town of Ah@@ mad@@ z .
from the local sources , the com@@ bu@@ ters were so strong that the doctors could not do anything more .
he died short time later .
it was not the only self @-@ murder , who did in August within the Arab Ah@@ l@@ az@@ i minority , and campa@@ igners war@@ ns to war@@ n that even more men could take this life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announces that this month will have some other - Ham@@ id mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - ho@@ oked .
their stories have a thing in common : it was all family v@@ ä@@ ter who felt thanks to the persecution of the Iranian government , both hel@@ pl@@ ess and impot@@ ent to feed their families and follow a secure job .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region where most of the Arab Ah@@ l@@ az@@ i communities living in Iran was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to manage their livel@@ i@@ hoods .
in a century ago the Arabic Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predomin@@ antly autonom@@ ous region in Iran until the P@@ ein@@ avi @-@ Mon@@ archy took over power and took up 1925 great efforts to end the ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the biggest in Iran in the coming oil and gas fields , as well as some of the rich@@ est and most valuable areas for agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slow , and the native population has only little of that wealth .
it is often victims of untreated illnesses , hunger and austerity .
the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ l@@ az@@ i Arabs systematically and in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government has also built a variety of dem@@ ons , the waters from the Arab territories to the Persian regions where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are surrounding .
these dem@@ ons have only led to ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by drying in the region , and to destroy local farming as well as the fish and palm @-@ trees industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab nation@@ als rose by 81 % now .
NO@@ UR Moh@@ ammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director@@ ate General , for co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , announces that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who completed a job , the primary school is completed , 55 % a further school finished and 45 % have university degrees .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance . &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights def@@ ender meeting in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ mor@@ den among the young Ah@@ el@@ az@@ i men .
Doh@@ im@@ i said that particularly the unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ah@@ mad@@ ine@@ z an@@ alogy and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the process of employment :
since functional and institutions do not pre@@ fers Arab labour , the local Arab Ah@@ l@@ ah@@ i will ent@@ ru@@ de access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs , and to force them to earn their livel@@ i@@ hoods outside their native country .
there are people who had to change their suburbs and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i as even Arab names in the workplace are not toler@@ ated , because the speaking of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arabic clothing .
given the given circumstances , which the Arab Ah@@ as@@ az@@ i have to end@@ ure , human @-@ human @-@ activity alert , before the situation is explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world will wake up and take note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is un@@ iting depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I do not identify with the Femin@@ ism even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
the following article is an revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was published originally on the webpage of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was subject to several discussions where many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should have all femin@@ ist * inside .
for instance , women today still earn less money in spite of equal formation than men .
that women are still under strict observation , if it is about what they can do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come sooner or later in various fields of life to a glass of glass , and discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and fai@@ ths .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced of it and I will be twice and thre@@ e@@ fold .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I &apos;m talking about skin colour , on black CIS women , on black women @-@ women , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ pora , when I don &apos;t mention , on which type we have always been physically , se@@ el@@ astic and ver@@ bal dis@@ needs , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists , healed and white inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alist femin@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , all agree on that women - all women - should come together to up@@ lift their votes and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to sing the equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence a institution@@ alised form r@@ ist motiv@@ ated violence that we are exposed to black women in any doubt .
in addition , that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and poss@@ essions earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls are referred to by a migration background to the school as a white girl , due to apparent integration issues .
or that women are exposed in black ship@@ pers and women with a migration background to higher risk , domestic violence and violence employed in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want that all women , all men and at all humans have no skin colour which have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can join me as a black woman , in whose center the white woman stands , which refers to the sex as well as to the skin colour of a person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am exhausted and I will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ orient@@ ated spher@@ es , which always rejected me and many other black women and again and again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I ref@@ uses to maintain an ideology , in which the black woman is a human and margin@@ alized being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I ref@@ uses to join me group@@ ings which are also absorbed through cultural instructions our customs and customs in order to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program .
I will no longer try to create white women the importance of the over@@ cutting of skin colour and gender . for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to consume them for the better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was founded to give women differ@@ ential homes and limit yourself to the white Femin@@ ism is still the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I prefer to get rid of the femin@@ ism and conclude the motion of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism that was born to my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of being committed to a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m that is so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it &apos;s more important than ever that we can define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spher@@ es that are created by us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book of Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus : how we can defend ourselves on our own way , in which they are totally secure and in which the cultural , mental , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered that make the black woman out .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion after they have read these lines , I ask you to inform themselves about the hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , by which the black woman is affected .
in a bl@@ ur@@ ist environment I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this para@@ dig@@ m I exist .
I am accepted because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment in which my life is not rep@@ airing , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even to protect against pollution : the mission of a man , the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by Tod@@ d Reu@@ b@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports specific about international efforts to resolve environmental issues .
in the context of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
jour@@ ne@@ ying Nab@@ il Mus@@ a during the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in the Can@@ oe - with a special concern of Kur@@ dist@@ an in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a kid &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; tells Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of aud@@ iting , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization of Water@@ ke@@ e@@ pers Iraq - an affiliate of Water@@ ke@@ eper Alliance - who work to protect rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;

Paragu@@ ays Women and her harder fight against violence

the following article is the short@@ ened and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ dish . the article belongs to the series of the Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # devi@@ ation zo@@ dic@@ ine ) that reported on the violence against women in Paraguay .
the majority of names were changed to protect the persons involved .
a police force did Ada B@@ á@@ ez that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their expression that had become violent against violent .
since the end of their relationship had passed a little time and the police said that their statement would be placed to the files , but more could not be done .
as a further Frau Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of failure , also showed the acute display of Ada B@@ á@@ ez .
a few days later the second wife moved their ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women actually report to an ad in general , they do not gain any support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who treat them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit , to be victims of violence , in case report to the law enforcement authorities .
content 1 stro@@ kes and Statist@@ ic@@ en@@ 2 In@@ visible missions and a legal system that does not under@@ go any under@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , def@@ ective conversion and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women are genuinely negoti@@ ates , My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various indications and reports , which does not even show the scale of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the figures available are however alarm@@ ing .
in 2015 , there were 9@@ 600 ads generated by the District Court of 9@@ 600 ads because of domestic violence . at 70 % of these , it was about violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence among the peace dishes . there were also 86 % of the indicators of women .
in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically mist@@ aken , 55 % of women were talking about mental mis@@ management .
these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Frauen@@ minist@@ erin Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di only a few of these off@@ ences are actually displayed in Paraguay . &quot; on any woman who will be re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed in Paraguay because of mental abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
to any woman , who will be re@@ funded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; stated at the end of 2014 .
since Lady &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a separate criminal law , the law enforcement authorities can not adequately document how many women are ass@@ ass@@ inated each year by their current or former partners .
only to August 2016 , journalists during at least 12 cases of women &apos;s su@@ icide in the country .
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
according to her estimates dying in Paraguay every ten days a woman is due to violence by men .

invisible abuse and a legal system that does not under@@ takes anything
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z has been the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called his name for him all her former friends .
in the beginning they didn &apos;t want it , but then there were still . this should be rep@@ ented for ever .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but two years she en@@ du@@ red her psych@@ ic violence on one side - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious recogni@@ zable :
I never thought I would be victims of abuse .
when I &apos;ve read about it earlier , I always thought that only women happens to be sub@@ servi@@ ently , because they are dec@@ eived by non @-@ violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana uses social media to report on abuse through Carlos Vera .
without name to name , she wrote contributions on Facebook , in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two years relationship and told how he had formulated it .
many people rep@@ lied to their posts , including Carlos herself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically , whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they enjoyed the so long run by Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they were saying that victims of abuse have at least had some complic@@ ity to blame .
Victoria San@@ tos , which is not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that its former partner she has been drinking .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te cre@@ o ( &quot; I think &quot; ) that is made up of women who are all victims of abuse .
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listening to each other and support each other .
you do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ an case everything started with mental mis@@ management .
her prosper@@ ous partner finally managed to convince them that it was worth@@ less .
then he started to beat them .
Victori@@ as ads in the authorities were without a result , and also of their relatives , they did not receive support .
she conducted a process against her former partner who developed into an un@@ mistak@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and her homeland , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paragu@@ ay laws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good but not applied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a road full of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , sees also great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was deb@@ ated in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ elli@@ la ( # Für@@ s ) .
this has@@ ht@@ ag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
the original design of the law fores@@ ees just Fem@@ izi@@ de to explain a stub@@ born crime and to be tough@@ er as it is in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the bill of law was changed in a few points to also win MEPs for the law , the feared that the path for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of Ab@@ t@@ au will be banned , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and pun@@ ished up to five years in prison .
the initial draft law had planned , most of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) process costs , which must bear the victims of violence at present even if they just want to report and receive a safe place to leave the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ator does not provide sufficient financial resources to make it available :
in Paraguay is being considered as part of a human relationship .
here a re@@ think must be held , so that force is no longer regarded as something Nor@@ mal .
who is silent in face of these facts , makes themselves stran@@ ger and contributes to the fact that the perpet@@ rators are stra@@ ined off .
we have to refund as long as possible , until mis@@ management is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Sen@@ at . however , parts of the law was changed . in fact , some passage of the law was kn@@ itted in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions about the changes are apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for ag@@ g@@ ressor , to turn his sacrifice again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the fil@@ ing of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ as@@ sment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great retreat . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in O@@ man was still exposed to ban on ass@@ aul@@ ts a year after b@@ anning a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website has been blocked because of a decision by the Minister of Information and is found on the website of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bot@@ tom@@ ed newspaper Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago the om@@ anic authorities have made the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting of corruption in the sult@@ an industry .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be prison , where he was fine for one year old .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and put to trial , but later they were free .
O@@ man is governed by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power after having his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , through a state dispute .
since then , he , besides his role as the sole Sult@@ an , the main minist@@ ries in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Ober@@ ster Command , Foreign Minister , Foreign Minister , Secretary of the Supreme Council for planning and President of the Central Bank .
the domination of the sult@@ ans is characterized by the persist@@ ence effort of security forces , in particular of domestic intelligence , including freedom of freedom , including freedom of freedom , defense and human rights , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists , to conc@@ ise and det@@ ention .
the authorities p@@ ains peaceful and socially legitimate activities in human rights systematically and advocate citizens , also campa@@ igners , to express their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and the det@@ ention three of their editors in the last year is a harsh blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its establishment has been reported on corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of Az@@ am@@ n , who was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 and published an article entitled &quot; high @-@ ranking parties &quot; in the judiciary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in this report government accused , judges of the Supreme Court in O@@ man under pressure have been put under pressure to raise a judgment in an inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n from 26 July 2016 on the title page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the Board Member , held from the ISS in front of the Special Department and were arrested on his arrival by the security gu@@ ards .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the dep@@ uty chief @-@ in @-@ Chief of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is had an editor as the editor @-@ in @-@ chief .
the newspaper was closed at any given time after giving the information Minister the instruction had given that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on any way , including online from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 the first hear@@ ings in the trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison @-@ fir@@ ing and ord@@ ained the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned as a disorder in the public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the internet &quot; and &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ation of the &quot; mainstre@@ am of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty on the violation of a publication bot@@ s and de@@ fam@@ ation .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year adhesi@@ on and money stra@@ ins in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one year @-@ year profession was imposed against the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a prison in prison and im@@ pris@@ ons in the amount of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after using &quot; a information network for spreading material that could represent a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a deposit was placed in the amount of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the judgment of judgment .
Al @-@ Abr@@ i said in a hearing on 26 December 2016 in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison on December 26 , 2016 .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following the completion of his six @-@ month prison sentence . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to prison in prison , where he was fine his one year old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Appe@@ al also highlighted the decision of the Information Ministry , the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper sees itself to be exposed to attacks by the om@@ anic government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information received a statement , with which the closure of Az@@ am@@ n was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the information Minister has personally signed an additional statement in which the closure of Az@@ am@@ n has been extended by three additional months and thus giving the Minister again another time against the decision of the profession , the publication of the newspaper again .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where freedom of the press was viol@@ ated in O@@ man .
for example , further injuries include the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and exercising of printing on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online @-@ newspaper of the country , its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the det@@ ention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to end the comprehensive infrin@@ gement of freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately release and un@@ condition@@ ally permitted ;
2 . to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists will be able to carry out their work ;
3 . freedom of the press in the country to protect and
4 . under all circumstances make sure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in O@@ man can pursue their right@@ ful human rights work , and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial sil@@ ks .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it W@@ arri@@ er 2016 in Zambia , figure is carried out by its consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or mentioned in the media . this is an increasing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for granted medical research there are two reasons : there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria have grave consequences in the poorest countries in Africa as elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases through the pharmaceutical concerns are a major problem .
second , research , which is conducted by African scientists , in building own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it W@@ arri@@ er is Director of the Central Bank in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
it grew in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially as the AIDS @-@ epide@@ mic first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he explored on HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the s@@ amb@@ its health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices Dr. W@@ arri@@ er discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and through mis@@ understanding of the media concerning this research .
( Disclaimer : Dr. W@@ arri@@ er is speaking as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it W@@ arri@@ er RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . thereby , I support the s@@ amb@@ ische national program for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I also have a research program for developing molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogen@@ s .
G@@ V : what do you think are the important current academic topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions to have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain recei@@ vers , instead of being creators .
the solutions we get are often not used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here .
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe
the projects are carried out differently well .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go back here because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs much money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how large is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they concentrate , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there are needs for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ agi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
G@@ V : can you describe the advantages and cons of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often there are the limited speed , things to do and the difficult access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here .
the system that uses cookies only against payment ( the so called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , is limited to the amount of availability information and speed of research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the USA to India : like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed manufacturers change global food production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine that reports on environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on is bre@@ w@@ ned in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , as for example Out@@ red@@ ge@@ ous , the first plant , produced by NAS@@ A @-@ A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space , and consumed .
for almost 20 years Mort@@ on &apos;s work was created just by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question how many sal@@ ts can get it .
but beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he re@@ marked that more and more sal@@ ads were pat@@ ented , and that he could not continue using it for breeding .
the patents are not only used for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or cur@@ ved leaves .
in recent years more and more such patents have been registered on ever more plants such as cere@@ als or Kart@@ ing sites . due to these trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts are responsible for food security in the future of food production .
being a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia tradition , Mort@@ on is still salad , however , he needs to be more and more difficult for it , because his work is still more difficult than ever more constra@@ int .
&quot; it &apos;s like to lie in a river a rock , in order to cross the p@@ addle .
so we have to do that now , but it is a rup@@ ture with the breeding @-@ tradition , &quot; says . &quot; I think that this patents go far to sal@@ ads .
and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed any more of a new di@@ at@@ ite , because all the features are pat@@ ented . &quot; he makes it as good as possible and tries to breed the characteristics they want .
however , it is very careful , and endeav@@ or to use no material that is protected as a spiritual property .
it also joined a movement which is increasingly larger in the United States and everywhere in the world : open source Rev@@ ised ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space ISS red , red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at der Sor@@ te Out@@ red@@ ge@@ ous in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station planted and eaten . there will be tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather as if the movement from the IT area would come and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it was launched to make sure that some plant species and gene cannot be protected as intellectual property and are able to help bre@@ ed@@ ate plant bre@@ eders permanently .
in the context of the initiative , in short Os@@ si , , can US bre@@ eder to ple@@ dge that others can use the seeds for them freely .
however , this does not mean that they can continue to do business with their seed , and they can only sell others who can produce their seed well , to breed , and it won &apos;t immediately fold - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ente .
do@@ zens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
som@@ bre views
for the Emer@@ itus Professor of University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si pre @-@ board member of the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and for environmental protection .
seeds also plays a role in larger connections like biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to exploit the latter , or only little by putting seed with natural resi@@ li@@ ence .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; movement does not focus on gene@@ tically modified plants .
all types of plants could pat@@ ented , whether vegetables , Kor@@ n , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to purchase our aim of ecological sustainability , &quot; he says and takes on the increasingly common f@@ usions in the global agricultural industry . &quot; who wants to buy good , local and sustainable producing vegetables , should also know that the way that vegetables are bre@@ d , how this vegetables are bre@@ d .
nutritional su@@ pper without seeds / sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
members of Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ple@@ dges to provide others with seeds at all times . therefore , their approach is in contrast to seeds and plant characteristics .

Os@@ si @-@ suppor@@ ter argu@@ ed that the future of food supplies is com@@ promised , since the available co@@ pool due to the always numerous intellectual property rights to plant material , which is therefore always been restricted to un@@ locked .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Os@@ si , has engaged in her doc@@ toral work with gene@@ tically variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . she found that about a third of all Kart@@ otic characteristics are protected as intellectual property , thus it is not usable for plant bre@@ eders either at all or only moderate .
for other plants there are such estimates , but experts as Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass@@ acres tr@@ acked plants such as wheat in even bigger style are pat@@ ented like salad or car@@ r@@ ots .
a question of view
plants are thus bre@@ d that they have specifically designed features - from such , by which their taste or colour has improved up to such , due to which they ste@@ er in certain environments and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on crop properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders through more and more patents are required . genetic diversity is however more necessary than ever before , as the changing conditions due to climate change are much worse predicted .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spre@@ cher@@ in Car@@ ly Sc@@ adu@@ to to that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos &apos;s activities . with a total of four comrades and working together with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company covers the preservation of genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it considers that spiritual property guarantees other bre@@ eders , since &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patent and protection of plant variation innovations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everybody can follow as soon as the patent is expired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions are helping others with another approach to the same result .
so such protection in@@ hibit innovation not , but encourages it to be made available to the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees the other : 20 years to wait , until a patent expi@@ res , it is certainly not innovation .
and if you have been waiting for such a long time to breed for plants , which have been adapted to the altered environment conditions , one would have already lost the struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general public and we should continue to remain : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to make farmers their work easier .
that &apos;s what motiv@@ ates us and it will be impossible if we can &apos;t continue using the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on is not bot@@ her@@ ed on the concept itself , plant characteristics , but we do not create the characteristics ourselves .
the plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eder we ultimately have no idea how plants do it .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eder in the US @-@ state Oregon and Os@@ si @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who bre@@ d a culti@@ vat@@ ors but also bre@@ d his own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ o@@ cultures , which are needed for their cultivation of mass@@ acres , which is bre@@ d in its varieties on the concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is very gent@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some moderate @-@ sized companies ( such that are moving on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , we create the most smaller seeds companies , even without patents - either lean , or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewar@@ ding or both is the case .

Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eder by laying the plant pat@@ rons of innovative ways : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies , the pat@@ ches .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , since I know that my compet@@ itor will sell my varieties within a couple of years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you will be 20 years ahead of competition , thus making it very easy for my opinion . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
although the US seems to be a leading role in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , however , the concept has now spread around the world .
in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the area of resources , is working together with farmers , and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l works on an &quot; open source code &quot; which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si community for bre@@ eders in the European Union .

at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive powers of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that conventional plant breeding is not pat@@ ented , accordingly , it speaks against the current practice of the European patent @-@ market that has allowed patents on conventional plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a declaration is not yet a law ; it is now the governments of the Member States to put forward this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seeds and seed companies from all of the East Africa to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems explains that the organization currently holds a worldwide alliance for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems , to susp@@ end next year the official start @-@ shot next year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a merger of environmental and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit organization ) US@@ C Canada and the action group on Ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on Ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of the meal - a project and association &apos;s organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - publ@@ ishes a report . in this she believes that farmers will have the opportunity to communicate in seed , making it possible to ensure stable supply of food .
in the report also stressed the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable in@@ gest@@ ion systems - a connection , from the Lu@@ by Os@@ si hopes that soon more people will recognize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly respected where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to clear the people that still more behind their foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives in c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
we are still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities content on the internet .
this time I met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
on the weekend around the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian Government reports the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) which documented human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on them .
August , the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ized this step shar@@ ply and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information are@@ - despite this attack and defending the Egyptian justice and the Constitution through the authorities , to aband@@ on the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , even though it has never been so difficult as it is now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirmed that all technical possibilities should be postpon@@ ed to overcome the lock@@ out and not to give up . we ins@@ ist on having to fulfill our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is known as the first issued website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities launched more than two months of 21 websites , e.g. an independent message across MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ o @-@ speaking issue of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and J@@ aze@@ era , from the Qatar network of Al J@@ aze@@ era because of the &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

next to AN@@ AR@@ I also has access to the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sten and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the spread of Kolum@@ nen and articles that he does not write on access to third @-@ party websites and media .
now the blog , which he established to circum@@ st@@ ain the c@@ ens@@ ors of the Egyptian government , the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , who is also native to the User &apos;s blog , but it is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent almost 500 days in pris@@ oner , after he was arrested by Egyptian security officer in December 2013 , while he reported on the Stud@@ enten@@ werk and a video , how the police force physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada turned to the block@@ age through the government and reflec@@ ting what this means for him :
the , blogs to lock is very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi - and although the locking of blogs may not be significant for the world , so it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It was able to give me the feeling of a state of concern ; a promise , a ver@@ itable murder , pre@@ loading of the national Security Council , the lock@@ out blogs as well as any other web page for which I worked .
2 ) You have proved that I didn &apos;t write otherwise . in other words , my words have influence even if only on a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to the post of articles to get the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
however , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the Mu@@ g walk the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ing and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities held from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this erg@@ ates technical tests in the networks of different Internet Service Provider ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the locking of providers , through the envel@@ ope of Intern@@ ship and Private Sur@@ fing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Net@@ works ( VP@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the blocking of websites began to offer VP@@ N@@ s .
such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block contents and to filter that have access to Egyptian users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is alle@@ ged that the decision @-@ rul@@ ings behind closed doors will be taken behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis with the fact that they can proceed to trial against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and whom will they attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants spread .

day of day report newspapers across Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of many more postcard motives .
some of these lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year old in school &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ one second day is mur@@ dered a police be@@ am@@ ot@@ ter in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers from the army , nav@@ y and air forces to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation the non @-@ violent situation in 2017 reached the highest booth for 10 years .
the Brazilian government Global Justice call to interv@@ ene even the United Nations .
reports such as these are everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; you will find at least the managers of a local paper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the detailed reporting on violence in Rio &apos;s popular paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which they announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision declared the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report about crime who happen at every major city in the world like murder , cra@@ b , sex wast@@ ing , etc . , whatever happens in Rio , is published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so we do not close our eyes to the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a 20 @-@ minute video , that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war cross@@ fire in a country that does not recognise the war .
in the same video a journalist of the newspaper says that according to data from the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territories that are controlled by criminal organizations .
in the article , the newspaper writes :
we recognise that a war will dis@@ appears , if it is dist@@ orted , the atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then asks questions to be disc@@ ern@@ ing .
but we defend the war based upon information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and its partners .
will the name &quot; War &quot; more than they useful ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil does not argue the journalist Bar@@ alist@@ in Cec@@ í@@ lia Oliveira about putting violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this was a just@@ ification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to call the responsibilities at the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as in the analysis of military deployment in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in staff , education and a historical and self @-@ suffici@@ ency of the public service .
to remember : the federal state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent place in Brazil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of 30 violent cities in Brazil according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . this is the most up @-@ to @-@ date available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we look at the record rates per state , Rio on No. 16 , &quot; writes it .
specially belongs to the company Glo@@ bo , the largest media company South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been repe@@ ats the security policy of the state .
these safety policies also belonged to the formation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose objective is to con@@ quer by emplo@@ ying a massive police force a F@@ av@@ ela and a unit permanently station@@ ed there .
in the beginning this was actually led to a decrease of violent inci@@ dents . for several years , the U@@ PP had actually protected following several reports of the tox@@ ic@@ ans and repression against the poor communities who actually should protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under fire .
on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux expressed in one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence established in Rio does not set up the criteria for the design@@ ation &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio seen as a war also serious consequences for the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this calls upon the state to use resources and methods that are typical of a war . this means that an intru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy of &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and is the object of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lost balls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
war hin or her , fact is that the inhabitants of F@@ av@@ ela continues to suffer in Rio .
a week it is now that the police find the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho son@@ g@@ om@@ m to tra@@ verse the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence also this incident has risen : an orch@@ ard died as a result of shots taken by the police from a helic@@ opter .

to stay alive : bel@@ ated Syri@@ ans to plant mushrooms
screens@@ hot of the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal em@@ ag@@ itation and block@@ ages , mainly through the Assad regime against lo@@ y@@ ale troops .
according to victory , a joint initiative of the Peace organisation PA@@ X and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ ei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around a million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege .
especially strong , the region of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are investig@@ ating the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ ac@@ re was pract@@ ised by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , this has been introduced by rebels controlled territory outside of Damascus , under si@@ ege which led to local residents and depend on food and control points through tunn@@ els .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the years of time block@@ ade , traditional food , such as meat have become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large portions of the population . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a counter@@ act , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ in@@ da and introduce the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the conventional foods in Syria and are rarely a very rare part of the Syrian cuisine . nevertheless , they are an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the Belgian East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tion of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news Agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have high nutritional value similar to the flesh , and because one can plant them in houses and wa@@ iters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reported Global Vo@@ ices that has been struggling for the past three years , and op@@ pres@@ t his relief that it gains more and more &quot; to a famili@@ arity . &quot;
to raise money for the initiative , take nut@@ ze in consultation with the NGO gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da , the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge of the plant@@ ing of fung@@ i , such as Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected goal of around 12,@@ 700 million , but until Monday , 04 September 2017 , continued to raise funds on Can@@ Do .
the initiative is reli@@ ant on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of fuel scar@@ city are locally manufactured fuels from plastic , to supply the generators using the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pilgrimage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
afterwards they planted a little mush@@ room in a tub . when done so , they used a bigger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apprenti@@ ces &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the start of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms anywhere in the Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to bring the people the Pil@@ gri@@ ps for various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breach of Bel@@ ag@@ ulation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
distribution of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by making Es@@ sens@@ ations ( like paper , tea , coffee kit , cardboard , etc ) to reduce new food .
building new jobs , especially for women working homes .
to create new jobs for people with disabilities which are tied to their homes .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the si@@ ege becomes visible .
we want our experience to experience people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people protest@@ ed on 21 October in many bor@@ row@@ ed towns in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires that week in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were inju@@ red as a result of the forest fires on 15 and 16 October . this resulted in the government cri@@ ed the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a stat@@ eh@@ ood .
fires were also registered in the region of Gal@@ ic@@ ia in Spain , where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ bur@@ sts that spreads in the northern and centrally located regions of the country and around 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages .
in June , Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande is a similar tragedy , where it caused by the fires of 64 deaths and more than 200 last .
according to the European fore@@ surveillance system , which monitors the forest surfaces by satellite images , alone in 2017 in Portugal , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest , burned with an area of the size of the Lisbon District .
so that you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why civil@@ is@@ ance was not able to penet@@ rate the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
João So@@ ver@@ al of the federal government of Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
to Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing ev@@ acu@@ ated .
this Sunday did it nowhere : there is dirty reports of open roads that were enclosed by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria could have had a similar tragedy like in June , as the streets were locked very late . &quot;
furthermore , building permits in oils are inter@@ ven@@ ed with high Bran@@ dr@@ iko .
far @-@ reaching proposal for the rolls made by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was applied by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments .
&quot; the government led to the emp@@ t@@ ment of the law which allowed the construction activity , if the applic@@ ant has had money to self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; says João Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the environmental organization Quer@@ cus made aware that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees from slightly til@@ ted wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , to Br@@ ing of this species continue to spread further .
to such problems , the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , found as citizens information or tried to contact relatives , offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it has used its own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and inform@@ s the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer of João P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was reported on this fat@@ eful weekend in October so that the server followed the rush of 400@@ ,000 users who with@@ held the bre@@ aches , did not press the site more than half a million acquis@@ itions .

&quot; it was really tough , &quot; A@@ alis@@ af lived in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an existing building on the site , where we also worked .
there was no services there and no heating . we covered tu@@ ally in front of the open windows , so that we were not refres@@ hed at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ cu@@ af allowed his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for travel to Europe .
during the dangerous journey on the sea he suffered mar@@ ry and stran@@ ds on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities had rejected its asylum application , A@@ on@@ af came to Italy .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church who distributed twice the day eating for need@@ y people .
it is true that Italy due to relatively high voltage quot@@ as a sort of second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions , the asylum seek@@ ers in the country is cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the civil rights organisation Civil Society for Europe writes , the system is suffering from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special centres centers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ qualified personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be shared first when they officially placed an asylum application - which can still be drawn on a monthly request after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for an accommodation , either reli@@ ant on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ carto@@ af .
but his unbeliev@@ ing li@@ ver@@ ish half @-@ sheep helped to liber@@ ate itself out of these conditions soon .
after being made for several years different work in the construction industry , A@@ reci@@ af got its total savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a bran@@ dy .
A@@ on@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is success story is now topic of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Vene@@ tian luxury - a ha@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min W@@ ah@@ id@@ i .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only a few of the obstacles .
according to the official estimates about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans in Italy .
for many , the country is a trans@@ itional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years some of the companies were established in the company , including tail@@ oring , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some af@@ gh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ iters and the chef are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneurs Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ reci@@ af@@ s goals reach far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail trade and aim to reach back to the country which he had to leave mainly as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where is a risk , are also possibilities , &quot; says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ cu@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forget my country and I cannot live happ@@ ily , if I know my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of the community and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
A@@ cu@@ af is also for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul where people can learn packaging and preser@@ v@@ atives . &quot; in this way , they can sell their seri@@ als on the market and improve its financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey due to uncertainty and doubts , but at the end are stability and prosperity .
A@@ cu@@ af did this trip ourselves . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
Ne@@ ti@@ zen Report : leg@@ aliz@@ ations from Egypt allow de@@ grading social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Su@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , since more than 900 days in cust@@ ody .
he reported on the clear@@ ance of the Lag@@ ers Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ w@@ ya in Cairo , which was protest@@ ed against the removal of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ti@@ zen report is an international snap@@ shot , the challenges , vic@@ tories and upcoming trends in worldwide Internet rights shows
the Egyptian parliament checks a bill , which shows that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after regi@@ stering on a government agency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; users would have to use to use social networks within six months following un@@ successful leg@@ is@@ cation on the website of the authority under specification of their full name as well as its subscri@@ ber number . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who@@ ever dre@@ aming this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the fin@@ alisation of a pris@@ oner .
the law , which was advert@@ ised by six@@ ty parliament@@ arians , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
may be another substitute for a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the off@@ ence of the president or a high officials .
under Egypt &apos;s right the de@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation of the president as well as state @-@ of @-@ the facilities already stra@@ ined . however , under the law proposition , such an act would be suspected of prison and money , so legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law be passed , this may mean up to three years in prison for the sent@@ ences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate where the freedom of expression and freedom of assembly is already in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) took photograph@@ ed on 13 August 2013 , while he demonstrated violence against demonstr@@ ators who had taken against military coup , which was led to Am@@ t@@ sen@@ al revival of the elected president Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ oul wa@@ ited , as was more than 700 protest@@ ers who were arrested in the same incident , four years in cust@@ ody on a court appointment .
recently , his hear@@ ings was postpon@@ ed to May 20 , because the prison quarters according to human rights groups did not shr@@ ink the accused of bringing the accused from prison into court .
Sha@@ w@@ ko threat@@ ens the death penalty on account of such , so many human rights groups agree , spot@@ ting pressure from among other weapons of arms , illegal assembly , murder and su@@ iting murder .
in another case , a criminal court opened in Giza the two journalists h@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Ab@@ dul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tun@@ es@@ ischer activists too per@@ se@@ ated documents

the document published on 21 April on the website of N@@ awa@@ at published document , thro@@ ws a light on how the prec@@ ancer@@ ous plans to support the legal situation .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia le@@ aning the nomin@@ ation of his sources under indication of Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press release , which journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he entered the District Court in Tunis on the 09 . may as a witness in the case .
will China comp@@ el the users of social media to put their reference to a reference ?
according to new provisions of the information office of the Federal Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media .
in addition , in addition , the registration with the full real name will be required .
anal@@ ysts assume that through the elimination of anonymous comments in subjects within social networks . it is still un@@ clear how the authorities use these rules .
Chinese networks have proposed in social media to im@@ pose these provisions only sel@@ ective in order to protect civil journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we then see ourselves in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ aker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or def@@ aul@@ te We@@ aker , to register with the state government as the &quot; organizer of the information dissemin@@ ation . &quot;
this name is part of a law resulting from the year 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government will organise a list of online services , which also allows the &quot; publication of the information &quot; to be responsible for removal of content and to force them on request for the cancellation of user data .
these websites are currently owned websites like V@@ kont@@ akte and od@@ no@@ klass@@ ni@@ ki ( Russian two most popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mailing @-@ mail and d@@ ging of other services .

the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime matters and communication has been blocked because it works towards &quot; an information source that works with groups to involve a political black@@ mailing campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time Turkey is completely blocked the website . it is in addition to China , one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
