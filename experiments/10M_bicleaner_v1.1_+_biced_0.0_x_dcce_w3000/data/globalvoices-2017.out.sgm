<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US for at least once a year, I would go there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I have anced with American music, American writers read and run its sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indeed, this country had such a profoundly effect on me, that I was mainly done because of a American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham at The Pelican Brief, who covered the murderous conspiracy of a oil Magnum who were the Supreme Court of judges who were snatched his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "It was it, as if that is the absolute truth, do everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, had only reinforced my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming, that you can always be the one you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very nice way of love about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most remarkable aspect of his ascension is for me, as he is dealing with his bottiness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never ends with his opinion behind the mountain, as it says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says what he thinks, how a former colleague put it, and declares publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latino, Afroublicans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes that he won in the Republican presidential elections, was the highest number given by the party of nominate Candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was spellbound.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not fix Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalist program, which takes people from all over the world, a deep believing man, with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "also opposed trumps of worldview, not by Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours with the "Phoenix One" playing in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Tolerances of intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity that I experienced in Sandy Bahr who fought for her life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes who always with lots of patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counselling me helped me much with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those made by them embodiment my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump becomes his way to nominee Republican presidential election, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, most of the White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The discussion with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, I broke almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it's unfair to call the Trump voters as a racist.</seg>
<seg id="34">The people assigned, told one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates a lack of ability to understand the ones that act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the pectonic changes in their communities are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of which the most white are, for Trump, because they would like to regain control of a country that has disappointed me?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in the United States?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who comments the cruel decision to rise a man who look with contempt on those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (An.d. SC): as much as "udrawing of the whites against all other ethnias"; wording of white in alignment of the whites and whiplash, which means as much as Schleudertrauma) as it was called the big Van Jones, has exactly killed what America has done so magnificent.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it's nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background you like, America is always welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country, as its president, twice the Son of a Kenianki, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the choice of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white Americas on this promise, saying, The hell of pluralism, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again on the rod, say it.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who died in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton had Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "Donald Trump," "" "Donald Trump," "" "would have my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" "" "Mr. Khan." ""</seg>
<seg id="49">The quantity she replied with a vocal 'No!'</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" rocked the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latino a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" answer them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "she and her voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a monophonic and vociful 'NEIN. "</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan ended with words: "God be praised that Mr. Trump, is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now trumps country, she said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find any place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that leaves me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaean city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music, which is played in both places, not just the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located at the edge of a great garbage dump, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among the tourists, but the worlds originating from the nearby semi-Columbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now the La Banda de música (musibande) has now been playing in the community: one out of children and adults in the existing Symphony Orchestra, which with their music instruments an opportunity to overcome them surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the church of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English Zeitung The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexikos, is known for its drugs abuse and bonds.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after an accidental encounter with a French pilots who started a musical project and the youth provided a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the Musikgruppe very seriously, says the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come out of school, they run back home and immediately running after lunch they run by the dust streets to meet their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come lachend and playing with shiny eyes and play in the vortex you learn to play day after day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Müll</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village that lies practically at the top of the greatest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments produced from re-value waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with re-prepared instruments, made from local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for Musikinstrumente in Cateura, where recycler began to turn part of Favio Chávez in order to convert parts of the waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">Instruments imitate violins, violas, Celli, double-bass, guitar, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all of which were produced from the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and Musicians apprentices the children of Cateura, to the initial time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no space to rehearse and we had to work in the same place where parents worked in the garbage, the kids had no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: one out of waste was in violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments from recerated material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation called "Landfill harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) is characterized by the musical performance on:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world creates about one billion tonnes of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries are demonstrating how technology and team work can successfully fight against illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that makes the wild fishing fighting.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports international, practiced solutions for environmental problems reported.</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-release is done as part of an agreement with Global Voices on the common usage of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, this ship was already known that this ship was already operated in liberal and illegal fishing, before it looked towards the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The east African countries were therefore uplifted and little inclined to welcome a legislative reaker of this kind on their shores.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorors, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised quickly against the ship. they refuse to go one of its harbours and soaked himself to give him a fisherman permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply remember everything," "" "remember Benedict Kiilu, a leitender of the Kenyan fisherman Authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship was discovered and followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">2013, the ship was then driven from the waters of the region: it was not succeeded to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also compelled to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of pillage the land stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, the criminal practices crossed and resources protects, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries who had driven the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and stand on each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Renew Charitable trusts project ending illegal fishing. this project provides a" "" "Dream-i Technical Support" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is imprisoned, is secret, due to it extremely difficult to feed. therewith, illegal fishing is a leading cause of the overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Through the deliberate contempt of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems may harm that a deliciates balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, while taking action against illegal fishing, once were hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail, with the information between individual countries, the actions made today in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries can interact with each other for example lists existing licenses, news about suspected activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a harbor site.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea, via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to mark ships who fish in forbidden areas - such as double-lines travel - such that point out that a ship invites its captured fish on the road to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence, where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal offense.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries, which are against illegal fishing, can then refuse the assumption of such ships in their ports. what means that ships can not sell their charge. and that they might even be forced to pay for penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then it is a considerable financial loss for the owner, meaning that the illegal fishy decreases financial anymore." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, leitender director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that supports himself in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports a FISH-supporting.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The aforementioned platform was created to attract valued 20 million USD in lost sales, which will lose eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to the illegal fishermen who penetrate the East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East-Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing vessels which attracts the region's commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among which practices include actions such as the Segeln under false flag, counterfeit licence papers, indication of fantasienames, the fish-protected species and the fishings in nature areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they targeted the lack of international co-operation and make the weaknesses of a non-established control system" "", "says Long." "" "before a ship could illegal fishing and a country could then say" "" "You daring to do my port" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Comm to me'. and exactly this legal loopole tries to close a grey-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, Charles-i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks to spread counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships who used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked fosters ships and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Thanks to its collaboration with Interpol, the international authority to combat crimes, the international authority can share information on illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always further developed, helps the illegal vessels to make you hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide its activities and position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, Principanalyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships are turning on for example their automatic Identification systems, with which they can no longer be loaded by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system which connects various information levels with one another. it aims to help a lot more collaborating ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But, a patient-i's team can actually influence Africa's team influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO skyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">"" "" "" "recently, SkyTruth will open the Platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data, and through which the position of each individual vessel can be displayed worldwide." ""</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "it convenes with the neighbors to get a better picture of who what where doing - this gives easy sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unify themselves and combine their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project to run in which a global system allows the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only criminals but they also cringe.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships who had used to reckon without a license and hardly expected to reckoned with consequences, they now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in the Berlin-i-participating countries took a 33% increase of fisheries fund, since fishing boats more licenses purchased.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia, Greko was refute, Greko 1 found the inspectors there on board Schleppets which is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries also notice these successes. "the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries," says Kiilu. "we are a study object." in West Africa, several hundred million dollars had disappear by illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries joined together to the so-called West Africa Task Force. also, they fight against illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as a FISH-Level. "with certainty, the goal is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, the recent member state in Somalia could announce their first major triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag at the same time. and not only the ship was used without a license and were used Schleppets which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also included in the forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "with the take of measures against Greko 1 set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing tackle," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is a further success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative operation works to protect the oceans actually works across the world.

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To transition, one requires two important skills: passive knowledge, in order to understand the starting text and to active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is the case with speakers. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language - should not be in the source language - native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus, a French mother tongue, for example from English to French translator - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a mother tongue, the translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of superiority, reasons, or the relatively small number of English speakers, which may learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who even have no foreign employees, make translations still peaked internally. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered to be the best of translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confusing and puzzling sentences that emerge through machine translation, show that this technology can still no longer replace a human translators for a long time. this also applies to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the rarest English wordings in Japan, including the mysterious screenings which often smears T-shirts or pockets, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>

<seg id="465">The more she finished with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because they had dinner for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says it had never to hungry, but did not get indefinitely food. "I could get more books from the library of the households than eating out of the fridge," they remembered.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, which was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>

<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would have their formation, that she would have allowed her to lose back again.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was totally clear that she got up for everything she got up with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school, Alvaronia discriminated against. "one thing that almost never talked about, bullying and the cabanas that crime are exposed to when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents, a criadita is.</seg>
<seg id="477">I was able to invite anyone to my home. I had no friends circle at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians have recently voted into a draft law on the regulations of use and use of social networks. "</seg>
<seg id="503">If he is adopted by the Parliament, users and users must register social media in Egypt with a government authorities to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law, then a place would then be set up, which is tasked to use citizens a permission to take advantage of social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the Act, users and users would have to register on the website of the site with their proper names and recruiting numbers to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it is failed to do so, that might be a punishment of up to six months in prison or a donation.</seg>
<seg id="507">The draft law, which consists of six paragraph and used in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "jedwede Application, which runs through the Internet and used to communicate with others using voice, video content and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced upon, as the draft should not make an indication of how Egyptian authorities should impose the users and users the registration. unclear is also how they do not register, in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee the regulation on the stage of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentarians and Patrons, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered user accounts and users received from the telecommunications of telecommunications and a password "to get through the firewall, the Facebook blocked."</seg>

<seg id="516">If I take it seriously, it means that they should establish a strong surveillance system to filter citizens, permit or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to carry out a court process.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq, the veteran Hana Ahmed Raza and their team of scientists of the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq is to protect the spiritual Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of the bigger family of the Leopards, which goes through Africa and Asia, are among the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). overall, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to savagery, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they are getting less loot, at risk.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza in the video shows, "is the Persian Leopard the only remaining robbers in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the prosperity of ecosystems also depends on the fact that a big robber is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian Leopards in fact in the free hunting ground is small and goes against zero. when the team in the video provides that they have a shot of a big cat in the camafall, Raza are in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained Biologin, Raza is passionately assionate to another side of their country, which does not only exist out of war and conflict.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from the Shiaccawa High School on Shiaccawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>

<seg id="544">In the beginning of March 2017, the progress made for the northeast rose Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in the last six years to re-establish the lives of those who had been hit by the "triple disaster" from March 2011. an violent earthquake, tsunami and an atom in Fukushima had sparked disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo-newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which lies in Miyagi prefecture of Miyagi in Japan. the prefecture of Miyagi was in Japanese northeast which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring forces of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuated, because the tsunami had vanished whole coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">To this end, the Prefecture of Fukushima experienced a nuclear accident, already alone because of this already 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report from the Kahoku Shimpo shows what progress has been achieved after six years in order to re-establish the life of local resident.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authorities as well as survey results of the affected people themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned range of spare parts (accompanied, saigai kouei juutaku) in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were completed.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi had the greatest success among the three prefectures of Miyagi, here, 80 percent of the planned replacement parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has 75 percent of such houses finished, whereas Fukushima forms the final light in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, one still makes every effort to continue even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from domitters (resumes, kasetsu jujaku) in final spare parts reumble.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple disaster, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in homes and accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 still 36 000 people still lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such cases.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated population of Fukushima still live in emergency accommodation, whereas Miyagi was more successful in case of Miyagi. more than 75 percent of evacuated vessels, which have been shelving after the disaster in homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For ion, the number is here at 34 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of works and everyday life in the three affected fields</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine 1074 from 1100 schools, affected by unhappiness to December 2016, which makes nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of shipping harbors in Iwate and Miyagi are now back in operation in Fukushima only 30 percent of fisheries harbors have revived their operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident, have drawn in the three prefectures of agrarian, in co-scale.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the agricultural country in Iwate and less than 50 percent of destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear unfailing, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed Ackerland of Fukushima, are in the "nuclear plyzone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures of tourism, the tourism once again recovering once more, but also the Fukushima remains far more depressed.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are over 90 percent in the same state as before the unhappiness. Fukushima can only show 75 percent in contrast.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal population, it seems to be harder to earn their livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to obtain a overall picture, the newspaper led numerous questionings under the native population and among the evacuated methods. they asked them about the status of reconstruction and also how their feeling has changed compared to the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo-Newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to bring more information about the tsunami awareness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey brought that 83.1% of local resident, measures have taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of the respondents are still not done enough in terms of disasters prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had to evacuated from the fecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">In their edition to the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo-newspaper has increasingly directed its attention to the situation of evacuated Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the tremendous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, prefecture of Fukushima was also witnessed a witness of the worst, disastrous cases, atomic particles in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated Fukushima have nearly 63 000 people displaced in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, slightly more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, had been converted into permanent spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the booth of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima off their home fecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the roaster areas, most of the evacuated areas are still in temporary shelters, older than 50 years old. they have to compete in real homes, because the efforts for reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. this is a part of project projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="597">Doctors performed him on this Saturday and now have moved it into an artificial compromise.</seg>
<seg id="598">His state is considered to be critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, spread quickly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police beamed to recognize that with a stroke attack. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">According to the incident, the police police were known in the Brazilian state of Goiás that Sampaio had been expelled until completion of the investigation into the incident of the active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, as he defeats in Goiânia with its impact on the face of the students Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police force was beaten by a protesters and land on the intensive care station, his face would see six months on TV and all oppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook-Page "Desneuralizador," a press channel from Goiânia, divided the video from Luiz da Luz, which one sees how Mateus was attacked by the police, and several sanitary briefly to give it to him.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video of the same scenes, but from another perspective is also filmed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the shown below you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another state of state, internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian reais (approximately 2,500 euros) to cover part of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in Goiânia while he is in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="613">Goiás, a wave of political violence: here, the activist Guilmetry was murdered by his father, because he had joined the Occupy movement in secondary schools. and now we got the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a policeman, having been attacked by an policeman, having taken him with a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police force</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only State in Brazil where it came to brutal police officers against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen put in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had built a stage for speakers, rubber bullets and Tränengas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MP Flavio Serafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police via loudspeaker stealing against violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers around the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media is obstructive by clicking the focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a window board.</seg>
<seg id="620">The folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo reported specifically on a crushed glass window in order to illustrates their titles with a photo their titles.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, the O Globo preferred a title-story with a fire-driven bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalism reason to report more about a broken window, as well as the protests of thousand people who serve to defend a special matter.</seg>
<seg id="623">This one must also recognise if you are strictly against any type of state damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here, the term "vandalism" is also an absurd, disproportionate meaning, and the typical non-violence of the military police have plagued by headlines with the title "demonstrators" on the confrontation with the police. "</seg>

<seg id="627">The People's Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban Province of Mayoque, is commonly referred to as el Central - in Spanish sugars - known no matter what there is no nennalable sugars on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago, when the activities in the sugar factories were mixed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the awakening, the sugarrogas industry stand still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its installations, until only the scaffold was left out of steel and concrete.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 290 workers were forced to invent.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some alternate the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commute every day to the factories, which still mahlen.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who runs every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugars industry does not smoke his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that it is in the east of the region of sugar mills, who are after a long inactive time in operation, because they have been received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he was not expecting.</seg>
<seg id="636">Niene reminds us that in MañalI would get the sugarrohrfactory would not be kept, but the promise has not been kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugars industry have already resisted the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiencies, the bad administration and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the 1910 produced quantity.</seg>
<seg id="639">This message would have been a motive for alarm for the country a few decades, but the poor harvests are no longer any news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugars industry off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway track of the congregation already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugars industry was an economical need: the 155 sugar mills were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became insustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production goals was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories, which can produce sugar for at most than 4 Centavos (0,03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives prompted to such measures were the low productivity of sugar farms and the sugars in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price increased from about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025 the price of unrefined sugar between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound remain, according to the 2016 published report "agricultural perspectives" from the OECD and FAO, agricultural and food organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current level of 2001 would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tons), the raw material would manage around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>

<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day comes with security into history," "" "those were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From there, the process of restructuring in the sugars began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the inhibiting of overall 98 sugar mills, more than 65 million people got their full guessory for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugarrohrfactory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked since 1967 in the factory.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, who speaks to the closing of the factory, is the word he repeated the most, "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Nearly all respondents are of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">Thus the place will be preserved, they formed a full-time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">In front of the first half-year, the first letters began to come.</seg>

<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, but the Minister could not approve any of the offence.</seg>
<seg id="663">From there the responsibility was over, and those letters have always been more frequent.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities in the whole Canada deal with subjects that are important to them. they do this by Hip Hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour we have worked directly to schools and youth centres, in order to teach youth groups, songwriting, recording, audio- and video- and live appearances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked with the Cree Hip Hop group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop will increase the young participants in conversation such as "cultural identity, language, discussion, love, self acceptance," or whatever comes up to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize other workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school "Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsuman First nation in British Columbia, for example, called the History of Highway 16, also called 'highway of tears," on the almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely not illuminated.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of the globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youth have not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First nation have recorded, the refrain will be made on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The youngsters got some help from Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip Hop Hop group, who gave them a strophe in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the facebookpage of N'we Jinan is available to the Strophe magazine, also a translation into English, translated into German by:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if none were ever interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on earth for my days</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take our cry out!</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day to us</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad living</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and also lead to our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do that, which determines the Creator</seg>

<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic geries.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are a variety of these small companies that just produce those sculptural dishes produced by the German filmmakers Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese are these plastic-based foods so usually they do not even reflect on them. however, a new trend is now turning it into showy phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>

<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses like El Chapo Guzmán, Chief of the Sinaloa Kartell, thrust the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent diarrhoea, someone does not look at the mourn or in the communities who have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Thereby lies behind every corpse, behind every bone marrow in the hundreds of married graves, the stories unspoiled parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose guunds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político holds the digital project "Aprany a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with drug dealers,") to give this sacrifice a voice and tells stories about people who made the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as:</seg>
<seg id="755">"" "" "" "organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives." ""</seg>
<seg id="756">The impact is much more profound.</seg>

<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Apri a vivir con el Narco" explains why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only show the faces of those who are to fear. we have to show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and government leadership.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, made this contribution from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be seen as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">Disease and Sensationjournalism I have been known for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I am passing on every day of time circles and see the front pages with images, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the Only, which is blamed or sad. it works, like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or do this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year cousin thinks that he will be foolco (German: drug dealers) will be when he's big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of the offence when going through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they were those of the people who have lost someone and those who have fear that they have happened to them too.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories are on mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The energy eplessness of the people is incredible for me if the death of six people and the disappearances of 43 students will be justified in a neighbor whom they were 'emerging. "</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to speak out that they are spared by such tragedies, if they are not stir and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four month Represstion in the Hauptstadtkulturkt: how a family withdrawn with threats." therein, she describes how armed criminals month for month put money from their business until they had been destroyed not only the business, but also their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of all that you have lost and about how many people can change your entire lives in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain over never goes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, telephone numbers.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She included her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want to be arrested for others, for you don't know when they will run or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I was wondering if wines would solve my deep-rooted feelings, but the reply is no, because I forgot how you cries. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega released the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: one of the violence signed by force."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he asks questions about: who takes care of the child of a misled woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexikos?</seg>
<seg id="802">It is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a Waist and he tells us he had to teach himself how to cook a egg, potatoes, and "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the flutes with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He relates to the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are unimportant compared to the pain in his eyes - an explanation of a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old he told him that his mother disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But that was not the day when his childhood came.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood has been past two years ago, when he was just a few blocks from his home, the bloody bodies of his father saw, created by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez saw the situation in Juárez:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and fighting against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of people, according to the Council of public security and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">Alone in 2010 the prosecutors 3103 Morde. this is equivalent to the incision of 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories, that leave organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories are living ever ahead of time. this project reminds us of those we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprany a Vivir Con El Narco" has established the data journalism project Narcodata, whose objective is to raise the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trading that the country has tortured in the past four decades in a understandably manner.</seg>

<seg id="819">But how is the years after something the first time is surfaced? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release it was leading irreplaceable, tragedies actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false pairing of image and event - "false description" or "false context" in terminology by Global Voices or First Draft News - deny the fact that there are plenty of carefull reporting about events in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions to our desire for images to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">2010 passed a gas station to the village Sange in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, kipple around and exploded. there were 230 people around life.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war in Africa the second-largest country had been neglected and thereby devastated. its streets in the region have become dangerous paths full of strokes, which were difficult to sail.</seg>
<seg id="827">Typically, the gas station fell victim to the victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">Administration's representatives described a fireball, the dutzing houses uncovered, including a cinema in the vicinity, which was full of people who illustrates the football world.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses verbled and resumpy corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the unspoilt.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture entitled "This is Nigeria '. from Imgur users Mystical Monkey, 12. January 2015.Mehrere photos of the incident form the grey-full scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of that.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows chains of shortcombs which are on the floor when people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not find its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo has been applied several times into social media, blogs and other platforms, but may not be attributed to related tragedies, especially in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, Boko Haram took the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eye-witnesses reported drastically by atrocities before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops have been burnt down and Leichname were located in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "however, the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one stayed back to count bodies," "" "said a local people for Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dashed, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only by means of satellite images, the following time could be previewed.</seg>
<seg id="844">The cause for the attack was also unsolved, but the armies in Baga was a permanent conflict-conflict between the military Nigerian and an attempt to win the Boko Haram in the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture taken from the Democratic Republic of Congo back to, when it was misdiagnosed as proof of the fact and the potential extent of attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">It is not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of undesirable supplements; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all of these cases the picture was presented as a testament to mass charges.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further bring personal comments like this example misunderstandably the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange joined in Myanmar with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Bringya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee, rape and alleged deaths, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from violence against the Rohingya, posters like the following that these descriptions with photos from the Democratic Republic of Congo brought together:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an acidi-Arab news across the 2012, the President Myanmars Thein being said, monks and politicians have been involved in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims; in addition she had used the image of the Democratic Republic of Congo to cover this information.</seg>

<seg id="903">Myanmar, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="904">The Myanmar Government published a judgement on what they came as "deliberately finalised news and photographs, the international media, international human rights organisations and governments, in an attempt to create misconceptions regarding Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="905">This judgement that has been published exclusively in English also includes references to counterfeit images of rumors who run Hate Speech and used by extremist groups to set out that Muslims are Buddhists kill and the other way (which often is spread by burmesan nationalists).</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "Russia, 2012." "" "Fie ристианофшия пили брькция шия шия шия," "" "(Christianophobia or political provocation?)." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">This mail, which was directed to the members of the Russian-Orthodox Church, showed clear that the picture of the DR Congo are not showing Muslims killing the Christians.</seg>

<seg id="909">This message evedged that the president of Myanmar had commented that the president of Myanmar with me that monks and politicians took part in the killing of the Rohingya Muslims; and brought together the story of the picture together with the picture.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and is currently included in this publication.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article by 2014 on Students who were killed by the Boko Haram, published by the Boko Haram, published by the showroom Análisis Digital, has expressly stated that the image does not originate from the killings, but it claims that it is a "similar gloomy attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">As the picture later in connection with the massacre of Boko Haram from 2015 in turn, the newspaper El Pais tried to resist that there were connections to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijerseYanıyorDünger Uyuy" (Nigeria burns, the world sleeps).</seg>
<seg id="915">The picture of the DR Congo dipped, provided with this Twitterhashtag, and used a discussion among Muslims according to the Boko Haram 2015 and the proposal to Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities were taking these events, the mutually in the name of Islam, a greater attention zollen.</seg>
<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was dotted as a testament to the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 (and more than 9.300 times retweetet). but the messages that were connected to it were intervened in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the goal was to focus attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of the media reporting relevant to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Portuguese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message that was supposed to be written by a "Pater Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacre, translated it discussion, like this here on Vietnamese and explained it to falscription.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the message, in which the picture was contained in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the organization of the Claretiner missionaries and Pater Juan Carlos Martos.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are further confirmed examples of an incomplete use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">At other accounts, aggregators and sites in the following countries (on the cap in Grau), inks are also no longer fully retraceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data-yields with URLs and times- / data stamp exist on the web crab and terminate them via image file in connection with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all of those cases, which appeared only clearly after the original unglamity of 2010, the picture is ultimately possibly a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (frames) that undergo this postings. the first frame is focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in terms of major discussion about silence in connection with the murder of Christians from Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the assassination of Rohingya by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing also uses the image to discuss how a African life is undervalued as compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion should be understood and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is imperative to examine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question is what happens when readers cannot give these images longer any longer.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are two people who are accidental that the water round about a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggested this mood of miscarriage and false information, that actual atrocities are intrue and narrowed it the actual grauen of what actually happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been given in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that withhold of images of a refusal, to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern that violent images readers and audience are desensitize and give them the ability to empathy empathy (such as this study, which was supposed to work like violent media on it, others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is some way to discuss violent incidents in the news media, fact that they are indispensable for the current news report.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technical informations are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News". you will have to think thoroughly about the situation where a picture can suggest something, but which can also be dissolved by the context or to fully abused species.</seg>
<seg id="940">Any investigation of false grants, however, should also take into account as internationally they can.</seg>

<seg id="945">Such words are available in any language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these non-translated words are already well known (as the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resists stubborn every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, why a full explanation and sometimes some context is required to exactly understand what is meant by that one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist came from "Untranslatable" Steven Bird, in order to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find the example words from the Mwotlap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- pick you up your parents in recognition of how to make you tried in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the "" "" Hunsrik language, which are spoken in parts of Brazil, such as: "" "</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "" "" "kwadi" "" "- The convenience or laziness that you feel after having warmed up to cold days in the sun." ""</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his Blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They slices other cultures, revealing other mindset and arouses our curiosity.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to connect here and now despite a language barrier to someone?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the number of stories written in its original language.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, the focus of TLS is not written on the written report, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages do not pass that born children there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project are:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass display of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that will not forget diversity - safe areas where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to attend.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening often, it is often linked to understand" "" "justifies these events instead" "" "listening to appreciate to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format you can learn and translate their story first in her own language, or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants do not have professional storytellers, they guide their devotion and their representation to the fact that the audiences can be attained.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They give laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows for example a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round the storytellers Rassidatou concludes also the opportunity to explain for their country typical customs of narrative art.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the barrel of the rabbit and the paddles in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the importance of his plot, John Nyamusara is asked:" "" "how is it to speak to an audience that does not understand your language?" "" "with a wide ridge he shares his sense of the inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">You were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">You were very happy with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand it. all that are inspired by the project can contact TLS, in order to organize their own storytellers.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a reexamination of public debt by Puerto Rico, which took place on 72 million US dollars, participating in the past 3 April 2017, various religious and civil organisations involved in a mass demonstration; the march departing in the Capitol Capitol, the Government Building of the Capital, and ran until the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>

<seg id="1157">The intercessors of the renunciation of debt has also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico calls for the politicians, benker and government authorities, who are responsible for debts for their corrupt.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We call for financial testing and editorial committee without personal interests in public debt, with strong, our working conditions appropriate remuneration, which acts in favor of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will erpressed and oppressed.</seg>

<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developers Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and family remembers the campaign to his freedom and remember the contributions he has done for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">This year's topic: publicca, the annual conference on the digital culture, which is oriented at Berlin, has devoted an event to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a researcher at the French resident CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, executive director of the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inenquiry (The costs of freedom: a collective offspring).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book that was published last year and is here license-free, contains a number of sets which deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is:</seg>
<seg id="1190">The book deals with how movements are built for free knowledge and what the true cost is with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who have worked on the movements for free knowledge, have worked on page to take over the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create something from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrates Internet volunteers, who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was knitted from the directory of the Adra prisons, in which he sat in place on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information on its current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory exists his friends and family a voice that push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for its involvement in a free culture, many of us have started to think about its own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we have chosen?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up to extreme beliefs about this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in custody syrist government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military facility to a unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "police police Bassel reported on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military bed from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported it was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who presented themselves as a insider of Assad's government and inform them about her husband's death.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His place of residence and condition continues to stay unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A leading the Creative Commons in Syria and active on projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a vital role in expanding access to the internet and to the knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, Technologist and currently transitional the Director of New Palmyra, a project, the Bassel founded on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Maybe none of Based cultural prototype are forward-sighted than the work he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 in order to restart the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cruciastle of numerous civilizations and here in Greek-Roman architecture typical with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would act on it, this architecture, which embodied not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This stripe into the digital archeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Typically, bass-bur of this project has not yet been shut down.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the man's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my entire life in order to dream of freedom and bass clarinet taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call its name nenne.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English at, even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read English well, to write and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with each one that was asked. he taught other incarnini, English to write and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened my door to technology. he taught me to use both computer and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet upon me.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He has also brought others to others how they use computers, at least theoretically, without being able to actually make one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the writer of Waiting (waiting), a commission that she wrote in the years 2012 till 2015 her husband when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She shocked the lyrics to him, when she visited him and he translated them from the Arab to English.</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests in 2011, against the regime of Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian network for Human Rights (Syrian network for Human Rights) has disappeared more than 65,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or killed under violence by the regime disappeared, were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Until 2016, since 2011, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International has died at least 17,723 Syrians in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many more people are unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We reiterate our demand today in the hope that we have to do so for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mosambique: because of corruption administrators, release from release back to prior release.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambiental reacted with anger in a corrupted case where a government link after half of his sentence returned to the place at the state apparatus, where the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for diversion with four other defendants (roughly 800 000 Euros) for 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds at Mozambique airports whose Council Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately demanding his reinstatement into the company, which happened on April 19 then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion by the General Assembly of the Republic, which were registering to the request, there would be no obstacles of Cambaza to resume their previous post, as the firm did not pursue any disciplinarian procedure according to his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many citizens do not include action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for public integrity (Centro de Integridade pública, brief CIP), a local institution that advocates for public transparency, doomed in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to resume the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and even greater transparency in relation to the efforts of our law so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the company should initiate a disciplinarian procedure against the asrescuing process.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company seems to see however and prompted no adequate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a major voice in the Muslim's social media, also reject this behavior as well and considers the case as "diswardly":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent guy, he would be adviser after he was sentenced to a sentence and took half away.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He may hold lectures and motivating speeches, he could give advice and to polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has enacted to reintegrate into the company which he helped to cause damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently it is obvious: Cambaza will be eager for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistant!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambicans and Student der Political Science in Brazil says that director possessing no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he offs it and cannot believe you be rewarded with someone in such a way that the state has already suffered so massive.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is lacking the morality and serve the state; * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead, only served themselves by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as handsome it's an inexhaustible money source and the state itself is tired of this man who was unloaded and finally condemned to a long detention.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly speaking, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users to injustice</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar Pae 'means Kichererbse or Spalterbse.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to data from Facebook users in Myanmar, the popular social network recorded its Posts from the net because it contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word still is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people ostensian origin, or generally used as an adjective. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or "Continue" (in Burmese manuscript) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of Hassenlanguage in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely valuable connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is commonly used by Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat Hassan in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism but the word itself is not automatically calling to Hassan.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posters in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed as to its use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings which have the same letters as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmeso also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words such as' Kalar Pae '(Spalterbse),' Kalar oat '(camel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends has been cleared today because he contained the word of Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a spiritual manner, whether it might be kissed his back pain by giving a word of word.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the Frageface (la) at Burmeso - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There have been several reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hills is the opinion that they will reduce hate speech radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook analytic be powers before it defends all the posters that are made in suspicion, racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook deletes the word" "" "Kalar" "" "not manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">Filtering the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatic shuism will not understand what you read on facet.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to analyze the post and control it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar Pae" (Spalterbsen).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three-legged nationalists are spreading the Hassan, a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcises its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all who distribute the Hassan, the efficiency of this strategy might not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Weaker demonstrated that the censorship of keywords often will start a cat and mouse play, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described as Facebook started to clear his posts as he wanted to tell his friends just that the word 'Kalar' banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive by Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"" "ironically my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited the chicks, post and parts of content for 24 hours because the post" "" "the Facebook community standards was not addressed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a large number of people from people who have no negative purposes or they just try to portray their opinions against the hate speech radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed, who has nothing to do with Hassan:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech made by Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author informed his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have to do more before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burymesan internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words to be censored only more hate within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It seems that they started out this without a local context or technical support and have forbidden as words as "chair" or "pecurry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they didn't try to correct the falsely solved Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefit, they would have a big sales to them, this would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has taken care of for much spaghetti among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now curled by Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hassan's language to see whether their postings will be taken from the web.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots from Facebook-Posts that were not a Hassan Pictures, but yet away:</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission to use.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmesan lyrics "is" I want to sit on a chair and pean curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to check out whether Facebook is the mail which the word of Kalar contains." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1334">"" "the post" "" "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the last five years there are extreme nationalistic ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their votes and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks is also planned to secretly in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the area Rakhine, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands of escape to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was meant for his failure, the balubering hate speech on his burmesan sites led to control, criticised.</seg>
<seg id="1339">Yet instead of being able to laureate the word "Kalar'at, it would have better to focus more on context rather than on code lenght initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the parliament of the country unanimously decided to unanimate a law which shall betray this practice, so that the proofed age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of the adulteration, some members were held in dusting and Muslim religion. at that time, brother Harrypersad Maharaja, the leader of the inter-religious organization (IRO), a group, the representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered, that the state does not interfere, since that, age is not the maturity punished. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">"" "this happened in no matter of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner for the UN's right to meet the minors," "" "the minors" "", "every human being under the age of 18" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were married with 15 in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent, and at 18 were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">2011 confirmed the statistical summary of the country that since 1997-2007 were married more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys below 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media-movements that seek to drive laws to infant-marriage, followed at the foot and delighted with great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">However, it was not all smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu-leader Z. B. had no concerns, the critics of the children's-toe, they should, is damn to take care of her own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition to tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and at some point raises doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But early in 2017, the bill was decided against the children's before - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which contained himself in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country must approve and declare the law asserted.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the senators of the country gave on Facebook a status update which Leslie-Ann Boiselle click on Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the draft law against the children's marriage was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for this and not a single against against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media-users had been enthusiastic because the laws on infants have finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-Member Lovell Francis, who have a Council meeting in the Education Ministry, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary miserie needed that has grinding the core of the thing, but know what? the marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now, and that is almost any price worth.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson of opinion was, it's definitely long enough to manage the practice was Lara Quentrall-Thomas overjoyed that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status Update on Facebook from Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which said, "suggesting news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The spicetz has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">"" "minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1365">Follow Mutota, which listened to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that said quite openly about how important the adoption of the law were, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The marquiring age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent from the religious of the 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft of the notification obligation was adopted today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The House of Representatives are 41 members and they were present at the voting age 35 during the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All MEPs were agreed to vote for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The children's-toe is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long fight (...) # childrenrident-abuse.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all the activists that have fostered him out.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congrats.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thanks to our members.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook is indicated in the shape of Sat Maharaja, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu-Organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaja has proclaimed his intention to undertake straightened steps, should the law be passed and he seems to redeem his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the General State of Paris Al rawi, an advocate of the law, meant that it would be legitimate if Maharaj would want to go against the law, most social media users, one would approach the debate on the subject differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed in front of:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, when we, instead of holding the discussion so general, in a way that would have only panic and poverty, when we would say the state to protect our daughters above that they may be beneficial to them, that they may be beneficial to them, "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a judicial approach to the law or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children's before in different gradations are legal or still the norm continues, although there are laws they subordinate them.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By the mirrors of websites, Turkish users can look at Wikipedia-content</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia-site was presented on January 18, 2012, regarding the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally lunked.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month Turkey witnessed the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day, more evident how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporter and fans of TV-circuits to be opposed to the lockout.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many engenetically modified Internet users are used to useable tools for block websites (an up-to-date article published by the New York Times on the fact that Turkey has the third largest VPN emblance of the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been articulated by Wikipedia since 2008, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society on Harvard University, will find regular blockages of the Internet since 2007, after the Internet Law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">To China, Turkey is the most famous country in the world, when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be locked there are now several Mirrorpages (pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">One solution came from IPFS (Interfaction File System) as the platform for all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralised peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator PC connections) which does not base itself on the system of domains.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of the legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a Blogpost IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we've heard the news (about the blockage of Wikipedia), we put everything on it, snapshots of Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the content on decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to see at least all Wikipedia sites, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS was also found that this step was performed independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only screenshots and no live- or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumventing the sperre.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni by Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a Mirrorpage of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to get similar mirorpages, when in the particular country Wikipedia is being locked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consunny i reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member and employee at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">This is not a complete copy of a proxy-address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One can access another URL which is not the original one. that which one then sees is by Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially the server redirects the request to the right Wikipedia-site so that it's possible to see the contents of Wikipedia yourself then when they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1416">With permission to use.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos he saw around him, never satisfied. they were blurry with poorly positioned motifs and well-balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivate him to carry him a camera with yourself and try to preach the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar, Neptune seems to bring to the international stage as an animal world.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown directly next to Chitwan National Park, offering it the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that steer the attention of Neptune world.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on facebook as it helps him this first class position in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live on the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographers!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I turned straight back home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) had invited me. he had received a call from my father, that on the banks of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran out with my camera and stayed in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched it and showed me the place on the other side, where the leopard was located and I immediately began to crack pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar is aiming to work with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepalese nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as scary about what they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he was already confronted by face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger is not disturb from the opinion of the sheep at sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Dormitory time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also, due to the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the buff were suddenly appeared. he immediately drew us, we see ourselves and he starstruck me through the sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar is the logo "I click for" "" "(lit.: I clicked for environmental protection) on his pictures." ""</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepalese and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited 22 days long, and lived mostly in a tent in order to take a tiger in the Bardia National Park recordings from Otters. until 12 days, it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect picture of birds, who live close to the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid having the greatest care, the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use an pronouns or say" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women that they respect the social pressure to respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences they should consider the norm to receive this practice in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto became condemns from the Indian State of Odisha by a hyparal, and come across from her family and the village community, having raised a budding relationship with name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also did not name by name, is also spread among men. however, they have far less chance to fear, if all, in fact, they should not diminished this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health professionals, as well as housewives, a unique club and became very quickly the main issue of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place just for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that exists in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and is committed to the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paan has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera in the uncover of practices, such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS infected, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reported on how these clubs are created a safe place for these women, and at the same time they were made towards the ambassadors of the change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini in her discussion showed, acted by women who did not name their husbands in the name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Speaking the name of their spouses is a bread, which they all sustain fully paid and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition asserts that a woman respected her husband and wishes him long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not die this is considered a list, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it up to this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never named her husband at home, at home, at home as it does.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion about her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law, and my husband has long been silent, after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash my husband, turned to me and said, I shall call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed it is a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the videoprojection, the women were looking for discussion with an exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked everyone, "If we could not tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean to not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married since 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their spouses over the lips," says Rohini Paine from the village of Walhe to Maharashtra on the breakage of a centuries-old tradition, in which women married the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise just stood before; another decided to let him out the whole frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenalin rush to have broken with an ancient bread, the women decided that they could actually try at home to name their husbands in the name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they stopped their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini, and asked what ideas she put in his head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she grew tense, she got afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband at a participant was less obvious and the situation was arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported on how women tried to stop other practices, such as the wearing of the zinnoberred dot on the forehead, which indicates the Husestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only need to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinnoberred spot if he did.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughs, and I listened to him, to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely heard of this, but mean, they are now in a better position, to choose to give it in some days not to bear.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we are doing a trip with any discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want the women make sure who could hear what could hear" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and spoken about things that they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">For so many years I have been working on these issues for so many years and yet I have spoken about some things such as our identities to our adulthood, nor ever speaking.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is linked to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have carried only saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most it's okay, but some wanted a saline-curta, a wide shirt over a trousers, wearing; they have not been dreamed.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own wardrobe, morals connected to the Saris and much more, shmuggelte Rohini its own pair of tas (Upper hemden) into a panel, so that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they have decided now to plan a trip to Goa where they can carry Jeans and Rohini is certain that they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion club, I have already changed something, Rohini confirmed that things get slowly into roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then listened to the name of her husband's name.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it even, but only if they are alone and not any other family members here are.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the eiling around more freedom of movement or their own wardrobe - at the end of a hard to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explained:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and other people about what we talk about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem silly since Singapore is recognized on an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the judicial Minister K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered to be a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on a meeting of the International branch of the Lawyers' Association of the State New York, the Ministers agreed that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party in Singapore since they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody has questioned whether new York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is because most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a land.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the judicial Minister, "to rotate the logic to defend the existing authoritarian practice of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all of our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, we say that we will not eventually be a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It seemed so vulgar, it had the semblance of a flight from the responsibilities, a must breach.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, then is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons behind Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', given the first appeared, invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">"" "" "" "on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore and cities should be compared to Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are led to a party permanently." ""</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the topic, then again the good old lyre of the authoritarian makers have to be the pre-Democrats leave the twisted logic as it fits better to its power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end of the last week of Shangrgam, they were given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our Judikative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions tared with non-responses to rational style.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shangrgam to clarify his opinion, since they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore was not a country, but a city, so the country is part of our town...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I do not understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful when our wered K Shangrgam the strain on himself would be clarified that point where he was paid up to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By sending his comment on the blog, he pointed out to read the full signature of the conference, so that it could be better understood to understand the context of the statements made by Shangrgam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said, Singapore was more" "" "city" "", "when a country," "" "he said why the elections in Singapore would be so unequivocal even if we were looking forward to free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He is engaged in Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party in decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore," "" "was not a country," "" "he obviously does not refer to this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is acting as a leader of a growing generation, such a polemian statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am talking about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore, very embarrassed...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and to the members of the old Garde which I expect - whether I agree with them or not, but this is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes that he really believes and is aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review explores the guarding of Shancourgams of Argumers:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Does Mr Shangram "committed a mistake" or was it a freelscher speaker?</seg>

<seg id="1804">The post-war company is very slowly recovering in East-East Asia, especially in the region of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">It has passed over 20 years since the Georgian-abchashic war was officially ended, but its scars are still visible in this part of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The deserted villages of the Northern District in Tkuarchal show striking pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and KharChilava are located in the coal basin of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Different ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, deprecipice, Georgians and Armenians were living and worked as hard times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their houses during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, the largest part of Russians and shrases are living in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also known as violas hostages.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period, more than 10,000 people lived, today, there are only a few hundred people in these spirit-cities.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011 the total population of the district population was 16,000 people after having lost over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 453,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1829">There were church centres, schools and kindergartens that serve all of the community.</seg>
<seg id="1830">Now there is only paved road with federated splendor buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1831">The people who once lived in this place and contributed their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union, have meanwhile abandoned the district.</seg>
<seg id="1832">In the Geisterstadt Dzhantukha, there are approximately fifty residents.</seg>
<seg id="1833">About 38 people live in Akarmara, in the other villages it looks similar.</seg>

<seg id="1835">Two young girls, both seven years old, look out of the window of a destroyed house.</seg>
<seg id="1836">As she rediscover me with the camera in his hand, they immediately move back.</seg>

<seg id="1841">Families are also involved in the subsistence farming (cultivation of land products for own needs) such as cattle breeding, beekeeping and vegetable-growing.</seg>
<seg id="1842">It is difficult to get back home rounds.</seg>

<seg id="1848">Despite her older daughter who lives in France, Galina does not leave from Abbasia to live with her. "my heart will be forever in Abbasia," she tells them.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Galina does not want to accept financial support from her daughter and insists that she instead supports her young grandchildren.</seg>
<seg id="1850">Galinas monthly rates are just nine dollars.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Brack was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the road of migrants to cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the mexican city of Aislula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexikanerin, a small woman with a corals-pink cornests and gold-coloured earrings in teddybular form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born there in Tapachula. nevertheless, they know a lot under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) become a destination of Africans and Haitian who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with deposit, toasting walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the first-room there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and haitian immigrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs Ramírez comes the people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At present it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept on map.</seg>
<seg id="1912">It does not want anyone to decline.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and takes them to the hospital when they are sick, they buys them medication that they can not pay them, they massaged them with a Balm made by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable nickname for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a Joghurtbart) posied with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Foto: Amy Brack.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "yes, yes, he answers with a smile." "" "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao gets with his sister to get to Boston to get there her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, however it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then pull toward the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitian and the Africans often travel together to the distance and that, Afrikaner already talk on Whatsapp by Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance, and has worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he has started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been guest at Mama Africa for months now: he sold SIM cards to save the necessary money to purchase the ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we will never go again," "" "respond to smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs Ramírez told her guests to send her often text messages if they went away to kiss her or to report her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It declares that her Christian faith is the strenght of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She does not know much about Africa but their guests have brought them to croissants like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very popular here but it is not the only funfair hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">We visited this winter in Valenzuela and his family in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the Buacet will be sold to numerous African migrants at a cost.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them get a reasonable price then he offered them his house for one dollar the night offered.</seg>
<seg id="1940">For the moment there are 25 people mostly Haitian.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a kitchenette outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explained that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells. "I have experienced what they experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border via the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived three years, he was directed after a raid on his work place from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he had escaped with his wife and three children who wanted money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and one unknown, an all-inclusive, has offered to it its roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">Some months later the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is all back crowded.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses, the passengers consult their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has given 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy about her house is full, but it is also nostalgic, because of those who went away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a respectable grandmother floed her in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African haircare that has made her a manifestation, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">They laughs, while they rehearsed them in short.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Ya's fueron, "they repeat each time." You have already gone. "</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-Point for personal communication devices in Xinjang of Twitter-User...</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minorities region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the Handy-users at the Tianshan District of the City of Urumqi received a mobile phone notification, in which it indicates the District government, a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message, it is said that the app" "" "hinder" "" "is supposed to obtain access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities may also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had installed shortly after they had installed the app, news with a private weaker group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app was standing and monitor the sources and the distribution paths of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with System-Categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blockage of pornographic web sites, of online fraud, Trojan and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filter for minors should help the children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" government actors or even hacker can manipulate the home network of a person or to steal from it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This implementation is consistent with other measures to take control of digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While announcements about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dull for those who live in distant, pressing ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and discontentment in conflict zones, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routeemian Internet discircuits.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Das auf Twitter based media-Outlet "Images from mainland China" (herewith), the censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where he checked the inhabitants indiscriminately whether they had the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian are sure people use the official Jingshan App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notifications required that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have compelled people to use appliances needed for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity through the berwachung technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from the mainland China" (resumes 中国語) also published a Jingshan product description, out of which software is able to uplift the password from a Windows operating system, and thus receives unlimited access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Xinjiang, computers and mobile phones become an electronic manual.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may require a response to the statements of the City of Partitions, to minimize the spread of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government of government, authorities and the associated institutions including universities and research institutions are committed to following the instructions of the Cybersecurity office when operating their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">An up-to-date report by Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi. to the first of August their "personal ID-cards, mobiles, external drives, portable disk drives, notebooks and media storage cards can be registered at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is to identify and destroy any "terrorist video," but they violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants, and gives them penalties for quite a number of other possible associations, including those that relate to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2053">I was always convinced that black was the color of the promise, until I saw the yellow light that presented us the Greys in person: the Raad (e.g.: "Donner," Anasting to the 13th Sure of Koran).</seg>
<seg id="2054">"you are here to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2055">Thus the secret was paralysed: to protect the state of security before us and prevent the slander and terrorists in us, they talk in the alawitches dialect - hence they played their denominationonous grounding card and gathered the narrow eye-field of their view.</seg>
<seg id="2056">This is not a house, this is not a land; it is a curse that call coexistence to transform the criminals of their sound into a hero.</seg>
<seg id="2057">I looked after the hearings and meet in Abu Imad, a slender and stems man; at least he comes up with me.</seg>
<seg id="2058">He begins a "pleasant" conversation, "despite the facial expressions:" my boy, you are still young, you can start so much more important with your life than to join those diedive and protest to demonstrations that will soon find an end soon. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>

<seg id="2062">When and how that happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me told me that I had to get used to be punished, punished although I did nothing to earn these punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2064">To serve in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this lovingly "gestion."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe, which probably comes out of the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your hen are rejoiced on your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure you with him and you cannot withhold your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My horror they fell not enough, why they replacate the pipe through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">During my first lap, I asked if the investigator had worked earlier as a garbage dump, or if that belonged to the normal working equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had four cables up to each other to present ourselves from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one single hour three of them disregarded itself three of them while still was on the line.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I listened to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner remarked the cooling and found no favour of a favor, which is why he attacked as a neighbor to an electric invited rod.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The jordan Rape Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken from Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends the bulk of his time inside; sometimes he shredded to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, every time and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can depend is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine beamed lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top of his family house, which had listened to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had to flee from her village in Palestine to flee from her village in Palestine (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist who simultaneously faced the conservative majority and questioned its old-proven opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and Rapid.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, who often deals with topics like Oriental, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only in his hometown Amman relevance, but also in cities that reach Damascus in Syria through to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years Hdaib sees itself as a person who is not restricted in his thinking, and he can sympathize according to its own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, which Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he isn't open it openly, it sweeps up against the US foreign policy a special inclination.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib regards his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, something with its identity as a "Palestinian fledeter of the second generation" - he said to himself even if he was born in Jordan and never was in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so because of my own life circumstances," "" "stressed Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I'm a man," while in water hollowed Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan. in this time, it is set for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordan law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking through ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sening called Junitag has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the lusures of the warm coffee and the swaders of the sick-cigarette in the nose is primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes though Jordan is feeling like a prison in the open sky, especially when looking into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">From therefore, it is easy to do basic things - just as to drink in public during Ramadan water - in order to land not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the internal Ministry of Jordaniens received a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary groups who support the Islamic Action Front - the jordan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontal kangular Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press spokeswoman in the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert "just" was cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the company.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many pretend to claim the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world, be more dangerous activism that questioned the old proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou" Leila the jordyan people as "progressive supporters of human rights" "" "which continues to apply" "" "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement might probably not be so silken, Rhetoric, but actually a clear and clear reality in Jordan, which clearly appears to appear in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib traditional venchternormen to Leibe by having his vision of the fate of Arab women to have vorehelichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The image shows the skeleton of a apparently Dutch unwell-known woman, whose arms and legs stretches up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who should really trust them.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, the number of 'honorous morde' has grown dramatically - the inofficial outward.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch showed its peak in 2016. however, the number of honoring in 2016 reached its peak; however, there is still more frightening that Jordan's institutional infrastructure were lacking in order to support women who tried victims of murdered or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the breakable control of the year 1954 women, who are exposed to the threat of infamily violence, "to indefinitely be held in prison," and for their liberation is often a long-long bureaucratic effort and the guarantee of family needed that the woman has nothing to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known to do not shy away from themes made in his country long as tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib contests that his work is politically, admits that he is his music, that is full of explicit assessments on sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot part from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I komm out of the Middle East, Man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was campaigned to politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and "Ghareeb" the focus was on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of the songs, which are politically politically, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and anyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"" "in the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words," "" "- be it faith or non-faith, Hetero- or homosexuality." ""</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly any one speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals still have been heavily censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib launched an interview for the popular Japanese tide programme Roya, to later notice that his comments were torn out of the context, distorted and his opinion were censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it has been uploaded without Buckle, but only has a processed version," "" "says he." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib acquires Hdaib open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that Intolintolerance is not talking about homosexuals.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu nuclear, a poet of the eighth century, which still remained in memory, thanks to its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib wonders: if Abu nuclear, who later should work once on behalf of the calibration, in the eighth century openly were able to write homosexuality, why is Jordanier not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila, or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new any more, that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices will be silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the jordan news was firm several former government officials and members of the teacher's association, with the reason they had voiced on comments in social media with the problems that are deeply rooted with the deep in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Given the concert Hdaibs in view, only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to induce a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanier.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a continuous giving and taking. Jordan has now revered for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - there is Hdaib - consists of slow, bedak and inner changes. it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the jordan society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also, from an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he dreams not only dreams of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to discover" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is going through music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bombs, extinguished and artificial nature. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to follow and accordingly there is resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebo in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warribs are as fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One assumed that it is a variant of Tangiata Festivals which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of topodium. another theory underlines that the festivities, the drums and dancing shines over more than one thousand years ago and originating from a time when the armies of the West in the northeast marched to force the indigenous people of the region, the emishi to force into its knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to catch a few great seating, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literally.)</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been watching the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two ballers are currently visible.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true one - and thus a stunning way to spend their summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Sommerfestival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and I watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18 meter high hiring was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let us enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Seldom, external appearance and body care were as important as in this story, because they help keep away from the Peruvian youth from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairstyling.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus principal port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where road-consuming and illegal drugs are daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">One in April 2017 survey showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region was not safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other middle and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the fallen styles of famous sports, such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Brazil), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to getting more normalities into the experienced hands of hairstyles that can form these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unparalleled demand for hairstyles, which go to the outer limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers "batalla de Barberos" which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts with each other to show, who can create from them the eccentric layers on how to see in the following video (further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, which is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to spend young people going to dip their weapons against hairdressing tools and instead of receiving a training in hairdressing tools that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered dozens of young people saw that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the beginning of March, and reported on some of their achievements:</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: Loving on guerrillas</seg>

<seg id="2181">The following article is the working version of the Beitrags "Liebesbothering in Guerillakämpfer," which has published the international online magazine Tea after Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">This article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important, people who feel oppressed you to accomodate his affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">It is precisely this question that the two young Colombian activists from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios of the Young-Youth Foundation is no longer of the head and inspired it to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (Letters on reconciliation), the young people to leave guerrillas from emerging letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Just recently, their land was a historic event, and they wanted to contribute their part to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla comforceFARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered the sign of peace treaty than so significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But in front of the ColombianWoman, there is a long way to get rid of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who have been exposed to illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war-rhetoric, and around the clock their weapons have been carried out in their lives, must now be integrated into the life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">"" "" "" "the Colombian company in turn, adapted to life in continuous fear and in some cases deep hatred against guerrilla fighters, must now take in their ranks and support them in building a new life." ""</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian people would have to collaborate and would have to help in integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love-party to former guerrilla-fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for any former guerrilla fighters - which should then be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea of reconciliation for reconciliation created at the world summit of Nobel Peace Prize winner who took place in February 2017 in Bogotá. there were Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to speak short with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the people we love, on Valentine's thousands of love letters, but those forgot they need much unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plane, he told he continued to share his love with people this year, which took the most urgent commitments.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, which now find their place in society and to show up a new life. 'letters will show that the Colombian society is prepared to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace, "they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now, more than 2000 letters were gathered in the framework of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that anyone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March at any of the Odono region in the region Caldono-Cauca on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo of the Foundation BogotArt travelled to the camp in order to transfer the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were on how they had done it in the past to counteract the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no precepts, but letters of infesting of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," told the policy knowledge studded Manuela Jiménez Avila.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a staff of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience like:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had passed the letters, a former fighters took me through the camp of the guerrilla combatants.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of cottage, in which the guerrilla wardamper live) saw, I saw a guerrilla barber who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I had scared to go down, because beside him on the bed was a MGL game-thrower, a mortal weapon in the thorn berry.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "and I said to him anyway, saying," "" "hello, what are they doing just?" "" "I replied to a letter that somebody has written me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never before in my life, someone has written something such a nice one, so I sincerely responded to that. "" "" "" "I suddenly had the tears of the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him quite firm and sat down next to the pomegate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired too, was tired of being all the years of the faithful companion of this cality, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life than war. to join the FARC, was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of famine. "I never thought that someone would give me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is outside a society that is waiting with open arms to us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Up to now I only learned how to handle weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace is reigns, I can learn a lot of things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New votes</seg>
<seg id="2221">Finally, students and some leaders of the FARC came to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all raised as a war and the FARC started in secrecy.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC are the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "many years we have experienced how the social injustice on the whole of the Columbian people have effected. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to making the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a purpose of this size, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who have never had heard before and no election was right, and to realize that people who are often seen as monsters and even hate, were also just people with beautiful feelings which were turned around by their living conditions and their environment were very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, does me sore.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all people - including those who have killed and so much damage, can bring us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the City of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The ColombianWoman was made sure that after the disarming of peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "as long as it gives inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are prepared to rise up arms and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC are putting on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we give all the defenders of peace - regardless of the race, religion or ideology - to rise above all that dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring victims, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend the life as the basis of existence, will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles in our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 questioned the distressing situation of the Arab Ahlazi community in Iran which is shaped by poverty and unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he dwelt in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he shook themselves to his own helplessness, the incapacity for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>

<seg id="2411">The region where most of the Arab Ahlazi communities living in Iran was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to manage their livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In a century ago the Arabic Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Peinavi-Monarchy took over power and took up 1925 great efforts to end the ethnic autonomy in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the biggest in Iran in the coming oil and gas fields, as well as some of the richest and most valuable areas for agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slow, and the native population has only little of that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated illnesses, hunger and austerity.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denied the Ahlazi Arabs systematically and in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of demons, the waters from the Arab territories to the Persian regions where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are surrounding.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These demons have only led to aggravate the devastation caused by drying in the region, and to destroy local farming as well as the fish and palm-trees industry.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Since functional and institutions do not prefers Arab labour, the local Arab Ahlahi will entrude access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs, and to force them to earn their livelihoods outside their native country.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their suburbs and surname to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, because the speaking of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances, which the Arab Ahasazi have to endure, human-human-activity alert, before the situation is explosive.</seg>

<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come sooner or later in various fields of life to a glass of glass, and discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and faiths.</seg>

<seg id="2489">Content 1 strokes and Statisticen2 Invisible missions and a legal system that does not undergo any undert3 Paraguays laws: good approach, defective conversion and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women are genuinely negotiates, Myrian González, researcher, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various indications and reports, which does not even show the scale of gender violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">The figures available are however alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, there were 9600 ads generated by the District Court of 9600 ads because of domestic violence. at 70% of these, it was about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence among the peace dishes. there were also 86% of the indicators of women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said that they were physically mistaken, 55% of women were talking about mental mismanagement.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayischen Frauenministerin Ana Baiardi only a few of these offences are actually displayed in Paraguay. "on any woman who will be reimbursed in Paraguay because of mental abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">To any woman, who will be refunded because of physical abuse, two women who do not do this, "stated at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since Lady's murder in Paraguay is not a separate criminal law, the law enforcement authorities can not adequately document how many women are assassinated each year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Only to August 2016, journalists during at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to her estimates dying in Paraguay every ten days a woman is due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez has been the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called his name for him all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning they didn't want it, but then there were still. this should be repented for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but two years she endured her psychic violence on one side - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I've read about it earlier, I always thought that only women happens to be subserviently, because they are deceived by non-violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana uses social media to report on abuse through Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name to name, she wrote contributions on Facebook, in which she described his insults and various attacks during their two years relationship and told how he had formulated it.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people replied to their posts, including Carlos herself. he asked rhetorically, whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they enjoyed the so long run by Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they were saying that victims of abuse have at least had some complicity to blame.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which is not from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that its former partner she has been drinking.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te creo ("I think") that is made up of women who are all victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listening to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">You do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorian case everything started with mental mismanagement.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her prosperous partner finally managed to convince them that it was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias ads in the authorities were without a result, and also of their relatives, they did not receive support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She conducted a process against her former partner who developed into an unmistakable legal battle between Paraguay and her homeland, in which it was mainly about money, power and influence of their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay laws: good approach, defective implementation</seg>

<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was debated in the paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porellila (# Fürs).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# non-Less) are part of a campaign on Twitter, which is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law foresees just Femizide to explain a stubborn crime and to be tougher as it is in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the bill of law was changed in a few points to also win MEPs for the law, the feared that the path for decriminalisation of Abtau will be banned, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and punished up to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The initial draft law had planned, most of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs, which must bear the victims of violence at present even if they just want to report and receive a safe place to leave the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective if the legislator does not provide sufficient financial resources to make it available:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay is being considered as part of a human relationship.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethink must be held, so that force is no longer regarded as something Normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Who is silent in face of these facts, makes themselves stranger and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators are strained off.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to refund as long as possible, until mismanagement is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in paraguayan Senat. however, parts of the law was changed. in fact, some passage of the law was knitted in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes are apart.</seg>

<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or mentioned in the media. this is an increasing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for granted medical research there are two reasons: there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have grave consequences in the poorest countries in Africa as elsewhere, and lack of investment for research on these diseases through the pharmaceutical concerns are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is conducted by African scientists, in building own research capacities in Africa. a greater role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>

<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he explored on HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the sambits health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and through misunderstanding of the media concerning this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier is speaking as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. thereby, I support the sambische national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I also have a research program for developing molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think are the important current academic topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only use solutions to have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always remain receivers, instead of being creators.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not used in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are carried out differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or go back here because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>

<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries. it costs much money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how large is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they concentrate, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are needs for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and cons of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>

<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine that reports on environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton is brewned in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, as for example Outredgeous, the first plant, produced by NASA-Astronauts in space, and consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Morton's work was created just by his own ingenuity and the question how many salts can get it.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But beginning of the 2000s, he remarked that more and more salads were patented, and that he could not continue using it for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only used for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or curved leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years more and more such patents have been registered on ever more plants such as cereals or Karting sites. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts are responsible for food security in the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">Being a passionate representative of a millennia tradition, Morton is still salad, however, he needs to be more and more difficult for it, because his work is still more difficult than ever more constraint.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it's like to lie in a river a rock, in order to cross the paddle.</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do that now, but it is a rupture with the breeding-tradition, "says." I think that this patents go far to salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before judgment, no one can breed any more of a new diatite, because all the features are patented. "he makes it as good as possible and tries to breed the characteristics they want.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful, and endeavor to use no material that is protected as a spiritual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It also joined a movement which is increasingly larger in the United States and everywhere in the world: open source Revised ("Open Source").</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather as if the movement from the IT area would come and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open-Source" seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to make sure that some plant species and gene cannot be protected as intellectual property and are able to help breedate plant breeders permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, in short Ossi,, can US breeder to pledge that others can use the seeds for them freely.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they can continue to do business with their seed, and they can only sell others who can produce their seed well, to breed, and it won't immediately fold - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patente.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="2650">For the Emeritus Professor of University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi pre-board member of the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and for environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds also plays a role in larger connections like biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to exploit the latter, or only little by putting seed with natural resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "Open-Source" movement does not focus on genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could patented, whether vegetables, Korn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "to purchase our aim of ecological sustainability," he says and takes on the increasingly common fusions in the global agricultural industry. "who wants to buy good, local and sustainable producing vegetables, should also know that the way that vegetables are bred, how this vegetables are bred.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritional supper without seeds / sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">Members of Open Source Seed Initiative pledges to provide others with seeds at all times. therefore, their approach is in contrast to seeds and plant characteristics.</seg>

<seg id="2657">Ossi-supporter argued that the future of food supplies is compromised, since the available copool due to the always numerous intellectual property rights to plant material, which is therefore always been restricted to unlocked.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral work with genetically variation in carrots and their availability. she found that about a third of all Kartotic characteristics are protected as intellectual property, thus it is not usable for plant breeders either at all or only moderate.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are such estimates, but experts as Luby suspect that massacres tracked plants such as wheat in even bigger style are patented like salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are thus bred that they have specifically designed features - from such, by which their taste or colour has improved up to such, due to which they steer in certain environments and threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on crop properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders through more and more patents are required. genetic diversity is however more necessary than ever before, as the changing conditions due to climate change are much worse predicted.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-Sprecherin Carly Scaduto to that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos's activities. with a total of four comrades and working together with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company covers the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it considers that spiritual property guarantees other breeders, since" "" "patent and protection of plant variation innovations." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everybody can follow as soon as the patent is expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions are helping others with another approach to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">So such protection inhibit innovation not, but encourages it to be made available to the public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the other: 20 years to wait, until a patent expires, it is certainly not innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have been waiting for such a long time to breed for plants, which have been adapted to the altered environment conditions, one would have already lost the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">"" "however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general public and we should continue to remain:" "" "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">That's what motivates us and it will be impossible if we can't continue using the best and newest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton is not bothered on the concept itself, plant characteristics, but we do not create the characteristics ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeder we ultimately have no idea how plants do it.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US-state Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who bred a cultivators but also bred his own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, which are needed for their cultivation of massacres, which is bred in its varieties on the concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is very gent." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some moderate-sized companies (such that are moving on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, we create the most smaller seeds companies, even without patents - either lean, or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives in censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">We are still unlock the Egyptian authorities content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time I met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around the 05.August, the Egyptian Government reports the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI) which documented human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on them.</seg>
<seg id="2724">August, the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities criticized this step sharply and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information are- despite this attack and defending the Egyptian justice and the Constitution through the authorities, to abandon the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, even though it has never been so difficult as it is now. ANHRI confirmed that all technical possibilities should be postponed to overcome the lockout and not to give up. we insist on having to fulfill our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is known as the first issued website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities launched more than two months of 21 websites, e.g. an independent message across MADA Masr, arabo-speaking issue of Huffington Post and Jazeera, from the Qatar network of Al Jazeera because of the "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web pages for victims. @ anhri one of the main data sources of human rights in arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Next to ANARI also has access to the blog of the columnisten and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the spread of Kolumnen and articles that he does not write on access to third-party websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he established to circumstain the censors of the Egyptian government, the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, who is also native to the User's blog, but it is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent almost 500 days in prisoner, after he was arrested by Egyptian security officer in December 2013, while he reported on the Studentenwerk and a video, how the police force physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada turned to the blockage through the government and reflecting what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The, blogs to lock is very old, however, has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi - and although the locking of blogs may not be significant for the world, so it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It was able to give me the feeling of a state of concern; a promise, a veritable murder, preloading of the national Security Council, the lockout blogs as well as any other web page for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proved that I didn't write otherwise. in other words, my words have influence even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to the post of articles to get the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The Mug walk the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thing and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities held from 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this ergates technical tests in the networks of different Internet Service Provider (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the locking of providers, through the envelope of Internship and Private Surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we noticed how the blocking of websites began to offer VPNs.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block contents and to filter that have access to Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is alleged that the decision-rulings behind closed doors will be taken behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis with the fact that they can proceed to trial against these actions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government to go with the censorship and whom will they attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day of day report newspapers across Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of many more postcard motives.</seg>

<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crime who happen at every major city in the world like murder, crab, sex wasting, etc., whatever happens in Rio, is published in the heading "War in Rio. (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so we do not close our eyes to the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a 20-minute video, that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war crossfire in a country that does not recognise the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video a journalist of the newspaper says that according to data from the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 territories that are controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the article, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We recognise that a war will disappears, if it is distorted, the atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions to be discerning.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based upon information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Will the name "War" more than they useful?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil does not argue the journalist Baralistin Cecília Oliveira about putting violence as a "war." this was a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to call the responsibilities at the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as in the analysis of military deployment in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in staff, education and a historical and self-sufficiency of the public service.</seg>

<seg id="2781">These safety policies also belonged to the formation of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), one of the federal state of Rio in 2003, whose objective is to conquer by employing a massive police force a Favela and a unit permanently stationed there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning this was actually led to a decrease of violent incidents. for several years, the UPP had actually protected following several reports of the toxicans and repression against the poor communities who actually should protect the newly created police unit, increasingly under fire.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux expressed in one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why the violence established in Rio does not set up the criteria for the designation "civil war."</seg>

<seg id="2875">At that time, Areciaf Barati, a 13-year boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in Central afghtsistan, for the last time with his family during the dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother did not say it then, she knew she would not see her son a little longer - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning, the boy should break up.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the flypers.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the hadatted party of Hezi-e-Wahdat was just murdered by the Taliban, and many hadara felt unparalleled, suddenly.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, for their hatred on the hadara came more and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the land toward Pakistan and Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Some days after his run, Acuaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked for a couple of years in a coal-pit. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little wages, and went to Iran. again, he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and snized saws with mortar that heavier than he himself, in order to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, the life of Afghan refugees was characterized by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really tough," Aalisaf lived in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an existing building on the site, where we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we covered tually in front of the open windows, so that we were not refreshed at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Acuaf allowed his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for travel to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous journey on the sea he suffered marry and strands on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities had rejected its asylum application, Aonaf came to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharaf homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church who distributed twice the day eating for needy people.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy due to relatively high voltage quotas a sort of second chance for rejected asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions, the asylum seekers in the country is catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The civil rights organisation Civil Society for Europe writes, the system is suffering from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of the asylum seekers will be housed in the more than 3000" "" "special centres centers." "" "this is improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unqualified personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be shared first when they officially placed an asylum application - which can still be drawn on a monthly request after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for an accommodation, either reliant on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Acartoaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unbelieving liverish half-sheep helped to liberate itself out of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After being made for several years different work in the construction industry, Areciaf got its total savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a brandy.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Aonaf Baratis success story is now topic of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a haara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award in 2017 which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Lots of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are only a few of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to the official estimates about 20,000 Afghans in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some of the companies were established in the company, including tailoring, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience, in which the waiters and the chef are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts the history of their trip to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneurs Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Areciafs goals reach far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail trade and aim to reach back to the country which he had to leave mainly as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where is a risk, are also possibilities," says "" "" says Acuaf with a smile. "" "" I want to invest in Afghanistan. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2922">I never forget my country and I cannot live happily, if I know my people suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of the community and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">Acuaf is also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul where people can learn packaging and preservatives. "in this way, they can sell their serials on the market and improve its financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey due to uncertainty and doubts, but at the end are stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Acuaf did this trip ourselves. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2934">Whoever dreaming this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the finalisation of a prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was advertised by sixty parliamentarians, is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the parliament and shall be debated there.</seg>
