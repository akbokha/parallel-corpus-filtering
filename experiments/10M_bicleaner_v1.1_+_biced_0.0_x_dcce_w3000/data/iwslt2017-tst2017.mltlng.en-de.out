this is James R@@ isen .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize at the New York Times .
long before anyone had heard about Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he pointed most spectacular that the N@@ SA has illeg@@ ally heard of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should give a permanent impression .
therein , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence holding in which the CIA was literally over@@ exposed to Iran to an atomic bom@@ b .
if the crazy sounds , you can read it .
it is an unbelievable story .
but do you know who that Chapter didn &apos;t get off ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years the government has established around R@@ isen and called him to call its alle@@ ged sources .
in this move he became a symbol for the pattern of government , wh@@ ist@@ le @-@ blo@@ wers to judge and journalists .
according to the First Constitu@@ tional Treaty , the media have the right to provide secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right when media does not get this information and if the identity of the Mu@@ g can not be protected that they will disclose .
so as the government at R@@ isen , he did something that many bra@@ ve re@@ porter had already done before him : he refused and told that he would rather go to prison .
so between 2007 and 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , only days before the process , something exceptional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , even though they were for years that it is essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to deer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the re@@ porter and sources can always hide less .
instead of taking place and bring rise to the statements , they could also settle their digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ator , without his consent , his telephone calls are being kept secret ,
just as your e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit agreement , and even travel documents with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they took used to judge Jeffrey Ster@@ ling , a CIA wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower and risk of risk .
unfortunately , this is just one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lowers , but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is home to much of her work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of that a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we therefore put the press work in the game , which is to be protected by the first Constitu@@ tional Treaty , because the government has more and more possibilities to cl@@ ing everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as technology has allowed the government to cope with the rights of repression , the press may also use technologies to better protect their sources .
while they are able to contact them from the moment in which they record , instead of entering , in a witness .
today there are communication software that had not yet been written as a re@@ sig@@ nation had written his book and it is much more secure than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source coverage system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers , which was originally developed by the Internet known Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , which was developed today from the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news page , just as those here are the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information as in any ordinary contact form .
these will then be encryp@@ ted and stored on a server that only the respective news Agency will have access to .
so the government cannot provide more information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would ask would not be available from the start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but only a small part of the whole , to protect the press freedom in the 21st century . &quot; &quot; &quot;
unfortunately , governments around the world develop new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger us all over the world .
it is to us to ensure that not only technology @-@ denomin@@ ator , like Edward Snow@@ den have the opportunity to conc@@ ede mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower .
the about ini@@ qu@@ ities in the supply of soldiers conf@@ essors knows and of crowded hospitals , the alarm goes to contamin@@ ated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street insi@@ ders that war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the largest dat@@ ag@@ le of history has been published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; was released &#91; that &#93; &#91; we &#93; &#91; see &#93; Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ate Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness about an explanation . &#93; This week we were reported by messages about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ ma Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a glimp@@ se of the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to firms such as Mos@@ pack Fon@@ sec@@ a go and say : &quot; okay , we need an an@@ onym@@ ously company . can you setup ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works , how it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has been re@@ signed .
there are also reports that a allies of the brutal dict@@ ator b@@ har al @-@ Assad approach in tax hav@@ ens .
it is argu@@ ing that a track of 2 billion US dollars will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin , using a close friend of childhood agen , a famous cel@@ lists .
now , there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous to the next release and the next un@@ ra@@ zed documents .
it sounds like the plot of a hum@@ p assistant or a John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ Romans .
it seems cr@@ ying away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we handle what ?
but the truth is : when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens , not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this affects us all .
for my organization , a global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some few to hide and to hide your assets -- something that we have been discussed and unveil@@ ed for ten years .
I think many people this whole world seems very conf@@ using , and it is hard to understand how these controllers work .
I always present it like a mat@@ z@@ jo@@ ch cliff .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it nearly impossible to truly understand who is behind these security .
it can be very difficult for criminal law and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really understanding what matters is .
I also find it interesting that there are less reports of this matter in the United States .
probably because there were no prominent American people in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who place their assets in tax hav@@ ens .
but due to the principle after which these tax hav@@ ens function , Mos@@ ma Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American buyers .
if we would have a data bank from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples which have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that in some US states you need less information , less info must be stated in order to start a company than to get a libr@@ arian .
this kind of in@@ consistency in the US has allowed employees to de@@ part school children &apos;s school .
it has allowed sc@@ ams to sc@@ iss@@ ure especially appe@@ aling fe@@ eder .
it is this kind of behavior that affect us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like .
how does it work ?
so we sent a covered soldier in the offices of 13 An@@ gu@@ ts@@ Companies in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as a African Minister who wanted to bring money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
so , it really sho@@ cked us that all the ones until a lawyer made our investig@@ ator suggestions as he could transfer his money .
these were all occurr@@ ences . none of these lawyers participated as clients , and of course not to pass any money to anyone . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual accidents .
it is not about a single attorney , who has under@@ lined the proposals .
it is not about a single top pol@@ itic , wr@@ apped in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and instability .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules .
we need to change the rules to make these kinds of behavior .
this may sound very di@@ m@@ ples as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing ever changed , as if it is always the rich and powerful .
but when it is born , I really see that some things have begun to change .
in the past few years , we have seen plenty of more transparency for concerns the owners of companies .
the issue took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU captured in central regi@@ sters at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who is controlled it .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US lag@@ ging behind this .
representatives of both parties have introduced a bill introduced in both parliamentary committees , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama &apos;s disclosure , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , as a means of providing greater transparency in the United States and globally .
for us at Global Wid@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need ex@@ ecutives in the economy that rise up and saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transpar@@ ency is not good for the business &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and apply for this to end this kind of in@@ consistency with laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can make the in@@ consistency that now allow this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing , finally ending . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story as I almost kid@@ n@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ ow@@ ment would be .
one day after I had finished my design study , I made a back@@ yard selling .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed there and looked at my stuff .
he sold one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and made just a road trip all the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where do you put it tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what is it now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
must I offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would come to the peac@@ eke@@ eping thing , but I don &apos;t know if he is planning the really plans . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a break !
this is a small box !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have a li@@ lo . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my mind said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How to please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was then in bed , I star@@ ed to the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I see on there ?
a wild@@ thir@@ sty in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a lot of fear that I got out of bed , on the door of the door and shut down my sleeping door .
but he was not mad .
we are still in touch .
the artwork , which he had purchased from me now depends in his class@@ room . he is now teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my view@@ point .
maybe people who were sold to me in childhood as foreigners , actually friends , who wa@@ ited only on waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress , it became normal for me . as I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my ro@@ omm@@ ate draws , and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it , be afraid to transform it into fun .
I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something about it . our apartment will stay in a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , WLAN and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and founded so &quot; air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy Gu@@ ards were allowed to sleep at us for twenty dollars on the air mattress at wooden floors .
they thought it was great and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese leg ro@@ om@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all the city . as we all passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Star@@ r@@ ten Brian and I attended .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rental ?
things came in roles .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept .
thus we presented our Invest@@ ors : &quot; we want to create a web site where people can post publicly images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their baths -- the type rooms , whose doors can be closed when you visit .
on the internet they can then invite wild@@ ly people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we wa@@ ited that the ro@@ cket would ign@@ ite .
indeed they do not .
nobody who is still completely at Tro@@ st , would invest in a shop , stran@@ ger stran@@ ger to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we as children all have learned that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
if one has a problem , one occupied himself on the things that you can do . we could des@@ ig@@ ate .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics - it is the overall experience .
we learned how to design@@ ate objects but now we wanted to do with design immense trust between people who had never met before .
can design afford to do something ?
is it possible to create confidence with Design ?
I want to give you an cost of what degree confidence we claim .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you from your com@@ for@@ ge@@ one .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now , I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ lock on your left seat .
this quietly indul@@ ge of panic that you are feeling now -- -- is exactly what hosts are experiencing , when they open the door the first time .
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the inter@@ locking phone of a stran@@ ger in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so also most guests feel when they sleep elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only sometimes so , who actually has Al Go@@ res Handy ?
could you tell us on Twitter that he is responsible for the president of the president ?
you can return the phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor had been introduced only once with his name ; if he had told , wh@@ ence he comes , how his dog or his children would be called ?
imagine you would have 150 evalu@@ ations , which all say , &quot; he can really very well origin@@ ate hand@@ ma@@ ys ! &quot;
how would you feel when you would have to post your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ designed feedback system strength@@ ens the trust decisive .
at the beginning we have made a lot of things wrong .
it was hard for the people to give negative evidence .
in the end we decided to wait for both host and guest departments , before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we studied how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are to age and residence .
little surprisingly , we trust the people most we are most like .
the more differences we find , the more we trust .
this is a natural social bi@@ ased .
thr@@ illing is when you add the call of a person -- in our case through jud@@ gements .
when you have less than three evalu@@ ations , nothing changes .
but you have more than ten , changes everything .
a good reputation sti@@ pul@@ ated simil@@ arities .
the right design can thus help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preferences .
moreover , we learned that confidence is dependent on how much you get from themselves .
here you see the reaction to the first message of a guest .
when you tell too little , as for example &quot; Hi ! &quot; if you don &apos;t get an answer .
one gets too much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted more likely .
so there is an optimal level of openness , e.g. &quot; Tol@@ le art works in your apartment ! I make holiday with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create it with design to establish a level of openness ?
we use the size of the text area to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which to write something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we had@@ n &apos;t reck@@ oned was the great amount of people who were more than willing to dis@@ courage these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people will take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the in@@ def@@ ati@@ g@@ able work of our team .
third , a need that was not covered previously .
for us the shop is just very good .
naturally there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have no parties allowed parties or d@@ well@@ ings .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I collabor@@ ated in customer service . all calls @-@ calls arrived directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front when faith was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it is already hur@@ ting when I just think .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the ru@@ fer , was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve ourselves .
fortunately , by the 123 million nights only a fraction of the problem had ever been a problem .
because people trust each other too right .
if trust works , it may arise wonderful .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his landlord was driving him in the hospital .
he even p@@ ending blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to be du@@ red due to se@@ aling activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are true gu@@ ardian angels who can save lives right even though they do not know at all .
you drive one of your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books over .
they can even stay longer without comp@@ uted the Extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course not every stay goes down .
but these relations behind pure money transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share .
when I stum@@ bled about this concept for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions together ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about an economic trade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now it is simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; car industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Share &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; describes trade , promising human relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people place a part of themselves openly and that changes everything .
when you travel nowadays , this is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but therefore less authentic .
what would be if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if at any place we visited , a group there would wait to complete a group there and show one in a pub drive to show that you have never heard before ;
or if you could cooking with a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to shape apartments from the ground up to the counter@@ part ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would share the thoughts of joint share ?
I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of lon@@ eliness and de@@ preci@@ ation .
in South Korean capital of Seoul , this project was already begun . many parking spaces which has belonged to the government ,
were now offered n@@ atives . students who were looking for a B@@ lei@@ be ,
people convey@@ ed to people whose children were out . they have been initiated In@@ cub@@ ator programmes ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share of Economy . our platform alone will be guests at night 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries as a guest at a stran@@ ger or even host .
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was brought to us .
we did not inv@@ ented the wheel .
hospitality there was even before .
there have been similar websites before us .
so why does our work just work ?
aside from happiness and Tim@@ ing we realize that you can find the right design with the components of the trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find that amazing ,
straight @-@ overwhelming .
I have to think any time ever when a red Maced@@ onian passed on to me .
we know of course that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thanks .
what do you think of when you look at me ?
a believers ? a Expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a bra@@ in@@ washing , is a terrorist attack ?
or simply a delay in the safety check at the airport .
this is actually true .
I &apos;m not giving you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media themselves represent that look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies point : the Americans mean , most would not know Muslims .
pres@@ um@@ ably people do not speak to their applic@@ ants .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ ag@@ ull @-@ fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ cian ,
and I am a pract@@ itioner , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga S@@ ings , because , baby , I was not so born .
I have decided on this .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ osex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslim min . I chose the Hi@@ j@@ ab to carry my head gear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why supp@@ ress you yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pre@@ stige was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist Declaration of Inde@@ pendence , and toward the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to give me a perfect and in@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only believed the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the cor@@ relation .
I read it , thinking , asked , question@@ ed , and believed , ultimately .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication , deep@@ ened with any reading of the Quran .
the beauty of the rhythm rhythm sometimes brings me to the wines .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone you perceive , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels like that .
later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian American Dream . &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had at the end of my breakfast , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; o@@ il@@ message . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people sp@@ ran@@ ged from the buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly into rebel@@ lion .
why should you do such a thing ?
&quot; &quot; ... I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... Zer@@ bom@@ bs Mec@@ ca ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country has been attacked but in the N@@ u , the deeds of others changed from civil society into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start graduate studies .
I remember , as if we were speaking , so deep it went to my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognised as the Muslim .
we pulled this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I saw , and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations who said , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ lei@@ bt in well illumin@@ ated areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; verse you not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then there was Friday in that week -- the day where Muslims gather to prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a destination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably worse , and I also heard about attacks on Muslims or from people who kept for Muslims in the free and cutting them .
there were really Bran@@ dan@@ stops on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because those people who attacked this land had attacked our country .
I have tri@@ umph@@ ed the w@@ ut of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly have to explain yourself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
there are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to serve Muslim and mos@@ ques .
they speak about my church as a tum@@ our in the body of the US .
this only raises the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ our you see as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor , one keeps only under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is false .
Muslims are like all other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , hel@@ pers and Olympi@@ oni@@ cles .
will the ter@@ mination of mos@@ ques of America be safer ?
there might be a few parking spaces , but not the terror stop .
the regular visiting of a mosque is to see people from other belief , and to show greater citizens &apos; participation .
and like me a leader of the police in the Washington , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
the radic@@ alization process has determined that it begins online . as a first , the person is cut off from their church , even by their family , so that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the real Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and its ideology is a tra@@ itor or by faith .
if we want to prevent milit@@ ants , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some are still claim@@ ing that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS had its brut@@ ality by the Quran .
when Muslims , as a mother , as a person , I believe that we need to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add ourselves into their performance world by recognis@@ ing them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam such as the K@@ u club cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology reasons for their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you cast a look at it , it will not push them what they had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality to read these things in the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding en@@ am told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , she brought to silence and told her , that their anger , their sense of in@@ justice in the world , she would only get into difficulties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nothing inspired and something that had given its anger sense , it was a main target for the instrument@@ alization by extrem@@ ists who spoke a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this vaccine presented the connection to God and her church .
instead of applying for her anger , he showed her constructive ways for real change in the world .
what she learnt in the mosque , she kept before joining the IS .
it was an insight that the Islam@@ opho@@ bia lead me and my family .
but how does it affect normal American people ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour use of fear affects our democracy every day , on our thought freedom ?
a study - actually multiple neuro@@ scientific studies -- show us : if we fear , happen at least three things .
we rather accept a author@@ itative government system , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ces .
one study reveals : if you have been reported in testing messages in which negative about Muslims reports , they were rather military attack on Muslim countries and circum@@ cis@@ ion of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
when you look when the mood for Muslims f@@ lowed up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times but never in connection with the terrorist attacks .
it happened in the foreground of the Iraq war and out of two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem @-@ terror as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for the mani@@ pulation of the public to hei@@ gh@@ tened the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well @-@ informed citizens .
the handling of Muslims is an early war@@ sign .
we may feel it perhaps as the first , but the toxic air of fear would flow to all of us .
while assi@@ sting collec@@ tiv@@ ities , it is not just about having to explain yourself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple that lived at Chapel Hill , North Carolina where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ s@@ men .
he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , and promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the hard@@ est , generous people he knew .
she visited him there and he showed her CV . she was aston@@ ished and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such a sealed young man from my quar@@ ry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Suz@@ anne in her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she mur@@ dered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was visiting in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as in a execution , after he posted expres@@ sions against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he took eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be mor@@ ally , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone on a mosque , or we remained safe at home ?
we fill it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we would like to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely .
we decided on the mosque .
with our son in the nur@@ sery we drove exhau@@ sting , with high pressure on the mosque .
I took him out , my shoes went out , went into prayer , and what I saw , left me .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Im@@ am passed an announcement , than@@ ked and called our guests , for half of the congreg@@ ated were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , A@@ thei@@ sts , faithful and non @-@ believers who were not to att@@ acking us , but to assist us .
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had stomach and compassion panic and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go for sure to be sure ?
or you will join those which mean : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thanks nice !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say , who might suggest that you hold a TE@@ D@@ talk , a way of thinking that are working with deep thin@@ ker , therefore an exception , and not rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that dec@@ eive you . I am perfectly normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
by looking to Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever performed study to Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am no exception in any respect .
when human beings appear like an exception to the rule , then the rule is broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ers , stands shortly before to become a milli@@ on@@ ite business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for professional threats . possible , this is made in research institutions worldwide .
before air @-@ reserve sur@@ fers in our social consciousness , a autonom@@ ous fleet of flying machines in France live above the audience of a six metres high tower of 1 500 bri@@ cks . several years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es .
through connecting flights , high speed and acceler@@ ation at the stem space .
they can also build self @-@ employed structures .
they have learned to carry the loads , to deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to nature laws .
today , we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our aim is to cross the limits of possible in the autonom@@ ous air plane .
so that a system of autonom@@ ous works , it must know collec@@ tively , where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at the E@@ TH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynam@@ ica Tas@@ ks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a spin@@ ach of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , comp@@ ut@@ ations on board that should do the machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external orders are available at the highest level e . e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter ,
a plane , which tries to beat two tr@@ aps with a fla@@ p .
like other star@@ ters it is efficient at the anticip@@ ating flight efficient , much more efficient than helic@@ op@@ ters in all its variants .
unlike most star@@ kers , it can float , and thus has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always one side of the down@@ side .
a limitation of hat@@ eck@@ is is that they are sensitive to tur@@ mo@@ il such as wind @-@ bu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the plane doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position can be achieved and the performance by exercise can be improved .
okay .
during our research , we often provide basic abstract questions posed to the heart of the matter .
one such question would be for example : what is the petty @-@ possible number of event@@ ful parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helic@@ opter is known about as machines with a thousand movable parts that compile it , to hurt you .
several decades ago , trained pilots have been flying @-@ controlled tra@@ ys , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a h@@ ap@@ ru@@ der .
recently we discovered that flies with just one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanical sim@@ pl@@ est remote warehouse . it was inv@@ ented ago .
it only has an movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no cl@@ apping , hing@@ es and Quer@@ ru@@ der , no further actu@@ ators or control @-@ surfaces , only a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanical simple , happens in the inner life a lot , so that it can fly stable and moved in space .
yet it does not have the elegant algorith@@ m of the h@@ eck@@ el . to bring it to the fly , I have to throw it correctly .
the lik@@ eli@@ hood to throw it correctly if all of me see , is low , therefore I &apos;ll show you a video that was fil@@ med yesterday evening .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is a practice in in@@ vin@@ eg@@ ar , this machine is here , the om@@ nis@@ er with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ators , a exercise in abundance .
what do we do with all this abundance ?
you see that it is only symmet@@ ric .
therefore it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
in this he will receive the most acute capability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter which direction he rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates .
naturally it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive streams of the eight prop@@ ell@@ ers .
some is set in models , the rest will be learned directly from flying .
let &apos;s see that at .
when flying machines are once part of our everyday life , they need to be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is composed of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft engines .
this turns in clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , a bit goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller comes off , the electronics or a cordless -- can fly the machine if limited .
we will demonstrate that by making a half plane .
the last demonstration studied synthe@@ tic mol@@ ds .
the large number of autonom@@ ous , co @-@ operated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we participated as usual Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a sli@@ ce of bread -- and makes it possible with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the especially safe machine there would like to operate at Broadway a flying l@@ amp@@ shade .
naturally it is difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the wages lies in the development and the creation of creativity .
it serves as a memory how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that there are creative , clever creatures which allow it to form so spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such a structural and economic potential , the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
1,3 billion years ago in a very distant galax@@ ie , two black holes are growing each other and faster , they turned the mass of three Son@@ nen in a t@@ enth year of pure energy around .
this short moment they brigh@@ ter to brigh@@ ter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy is not clear in the form of light --
we finally speak of black sol@@ vers .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time frame itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we first arrange the events a time .
1.3 billion years ago was a multi @-@ soci@@ able life on earth .
since then , the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rian , people , and -- God stand with us in -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago he decided to build a group particularly mu@@ y -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech - a huge laser det@@ ector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ based black holes .
most of them thought it was crazy .
but enough people recognized them as a mad co@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation has financed their idea .
according to decades of development , construction , conception and extremely much hard work they built the Det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the Laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ers Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ Ob@@ servatory .
in the following time the precision of LI@@ GO could significantly increase significantly , which improved the performance of the output .
therefore , it is called Advanced LI@@ GO now .
at the beginning of September 2015 , LI@@ GO has started to resolve a last test run by some smaller , stub@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , just a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ating black holes ran through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ ghes : two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the departure of my to@@ d@@ ill .
basically , they were the fruits of my life .
all that which I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ ghes , theoretical physi@@ cist on the MIT . he has studied the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black sol@@ vers and their ob@@ servat@@ ories like LI@@ GO meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft is a cryp@@ ting in the texture of space and time .
when passing the wave , the space and its entire content is stretched in one direction , and into the other .
to illustrate , fac@@ ulty in courses lead to the theory of rel@@ ativity often have a really confident dance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stretch and du@@ sty , stretch and du@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous , are .
on September 14th , for example , each one of us was stretched in the waves of the waves and st@@ ained . the stretching of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is called 20 N@@ ul@@ len after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st depic@@ tion , one explained the LI@@ GO staff for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser det@@ ector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ th of a nuclear kernel . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gra@@ v@@ itation
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LI@@ GO@@ s , hunting for the waves at the same time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties when building such det@@ ectors are extensive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are educated and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years prior to his success .
back to LI@@ GO . Scott continues to claim , LI@@ GO is more a ear than an eye .
I want to explain what that means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength that is much smaller than things around us : face lifts , the size of your hand .
that &apos;s pretty handy . for so you can make an image or map of things by reading the light around you from several points .
in tones is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that mean to you particularly much :
the face of your child is about .
instead , we listen to certain properties such as keys and height , rhythm and volume , to close up to the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now she is talking to Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob put them off . &quot;
&quot; dum@@ mer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot produce any simple images of objects in the space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the amp@@ lit@@ ude and frequency of waves , we can hear their stories .
at least for LI@@ GO , the frequencies behind the audi@@ ble are available in the audi@@ ble section .
so when we transform the wav@@ patterns into weak , we can hear all of them literally .
the gra@@ v@@ itation could tell us about a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has been very busy with Scott .
SH : two black , not rot@@ ary holes , circuit simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very fast , you hear the same d@@ ough with an additional ton change . this sounds like the W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u !
it is a kind of movement divi@@ ding , shapes into the wav@@ el@@ ength .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ ame Ballet &#93; Jem@@ and who knows what to hear , see this as the sound of -- SH : ... two black sol@@ vers with each 30 f@@ acher sun@@ k , which turn about as fast as the ro@@ ds of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : let us consider what this means .
two black holes , the di@@ cht@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve each hundred times a second before they col@@ lide .
imagine these forces before .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
in this there is the constant meaning of LI@@ GO .
LI@@ GO p@@ aves a completely new way to exploring the universe as it was never possible before .
this is the path we can listen to the All and hear the invisible .
much in all we can -- not see -- practical or basically -- not visible .
a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ hed stars in super @-@ nov@@ as explo@@ de .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the space .
the exciting physical processes happen however at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and si@@ lic@@ on .
we will never go through , because these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it were more transparent glass . the Ur@@ b@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the Ur@@ b@@ ang is covered through his own night @-@ lights .
using Gra@@ vit@@ ational w@@ al it should be possible to return to the beginning .
and most importantly : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen we will never see , and of whom we have no idea . things that we just discover by listening .
indeed , LI@@ GO found right in the first attempt of things we had@@ n &apos;t expected .
my colleague am WIT@@ H , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes as LI@@ GO they are watching the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , age @-@ old bodies from prehistoric times . black holes are so to speak for our ar@@ che@@ ological work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; LI@@ GO allows us to create a totally different perspective for events in space , due to the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerge from this chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AA : the challenge is now to be as precious as possible .
thanks to LI@@ GO we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the universe .
we need ideas for new ob@@ servat@@ ories -- a brand new generation of ob@@ servat@@ ories on Earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the big b@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream you with us .
thanks .
a while ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say to all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
regardless , if it took me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I ex@@ pose myself &quot; Yes . &quot;
would I like to speak in the public ?
no , but yes !
wanted to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
wanted I to start with the show ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly that , wo@@ ke me dre@@ aded my fear .
my fear , to keep speeches , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of one word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , my life has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes , that my life deeply changed , on an unexpected item it started with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls for un@@ expl@@ ain@@ able reasons all . &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; dear , I need milk for my beak . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked me if I could play with her , when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life @-@ setting in my family . from there I swe@@ eter me to always play with them as soon as you call me up . no matter what I do , or where to go , I &apos;m still saying yes - every single time .
fast . I am not perfect , but I am very fond of myself very much .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has a side @-@ blood@@ ed side effect : only recently I understood that the &quot; yes &quot; -@@ s@@ cars for playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a author . I think things that awak@@ ens you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I revol@@ ve television . I more productive TV .
I do television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for being able to spread 70 hours program in the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are in production simultaneously .
each program offers hundreds of jobs that previously did not exist .
the budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
a new episode every nine days at four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts at the same time : 24 episodes : Sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series run together on Thursday night .
all over the world run my series in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spect@@ ators .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts , which I created ourselves , and not only produced , so much more so . I must find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories to tell .
four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire , which burn around the world .
do you know who is still doing ?
no , this is why I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
I say it , because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I say it to you , so that all of you work so hard to take a business or a class@@ room to take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I am not just sitting on the computer and imagin@@ ative and scre@@ eds , and it is true when I say , I understand that it &apos;s not going to dream during a dream job .
it is all a job , everything work , everything reality , all blood , all per@@ spiration -- no tears .
I work hard , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened to work there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it &apos;s as if I put troops on a canvas as I was on a canvas .
so when we wa@@ its a high tone , ran out a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cru@@ el and rational , and the best thing is the bu@@ ck .
there is such a change in me when the work is running well .
a sum@@ ming starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s sounds like a busy road I could go on for ever .
many people take when I &apos;m asking them the sum@@ s that I &apos;m talking about writing to me that writing me pleasure .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sum@@ s - when I began with TV production , when I began to work and work and build , build , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , you cannot seek any other way according to size .
the feeling that cannot be compared to size , regardless of what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic .
perhaps it is called genius .
maybe it means ego .
perhaps it is the fear of being fail@@ ing .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I am not made for failure , and I just know that I love the bu@@ ck .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want it to question .
to make a clear one : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more the more winter there is , the more things simultaneously , the more I watch , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to succeed , the more it has to work .
and what do I say about work ?
I love working , not true ?
the country , which I created , the marathon , which I keep , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , flo@@ ated , exagger@@ ated , burned .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters to the truth acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single working TI@@ TLE .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kittens , I want to go to Sh@@ onda country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
are the children of a tit@@ ans .
they are baby @-@ tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum@@ s stopped .
the sw@@ amp of the engine is hidden .
I did not loved my work anymore . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as usual : the same tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , under@@ gone weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing Heads , a Titan F@@ ender , does not exist , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a Show @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had a fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the mar@@ sh and the sum@@ s was me .
so what do you do if what you are doing is the job you love , suddenly ?
I know some may think : &quot; h@@ ay you out , bl@@ amed the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
but you know you do , you do , you are doing what you do , you love to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a ban@@ ker who doesn &apos;t feel a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how the bu@@ ck feels when you stops the bu@@ ck when the bu@@ ck stops , who is man then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart h@@ ears , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; into a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mom &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say No , when two things are aware of :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say yes to all and secondly , she did not call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kittens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it does not call anyone more &quot; cookies . &quot;
when is this happen ?
I miss it when I am Titan , and my sum@@ s , and here everything changes before my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mom &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; yes . &quot;
there is nothing special .
we play and her sisters encounter this , we lau@@ gh much and I read out of the book &quot; ever@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it is excellent , because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ eliness and lack of sum@@ ming , I cannot do anything except to im@@ fit .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the land that I created , the marathon , which I do , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
everything that exists is stick@@ y finger and fier@@ y k@@ isses , delicate voices , wax sm@@ ents and the song in which it &apos;s going to let go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The king@@ d@@ oms &quot; can get started .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
play is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me does exist .
a mental door goes down and an energy boost comes in .
and this is not right , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s comes slowly back .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay in the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the working sum@@ s , the tit@@ anium @-@ cat , this is just the replacement .
when I ask you who you are , when I tell you who I am , when I &apos;m descri@@ bing the means of broad@@ casts and television hours and how do my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum@@ s is not power and it is not job @-@ specific . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it depends on the pleasure .
the genuine sum@@ s is dependent on the love .
the Sum@@ men is the stream from the lust to lust .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ confidence and peace .
true sum@@ s ignored the pressure of the story , the anticipated tasks , the expectation and the pressure .
the genuine sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps I whis@@ pered with God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is simply love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this in general , so that I can rid myself as a work@@ a@@ holic from any gu@@ ilt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the bu@@ ck again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I like it .
play is not a sat@@ lan@@ ise like working .
the truth does hurt ,
but I like it not to play .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to be at the workplace as a home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , because what kind of man works rather than being home ?
well yes , I .
once honest , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed , none of them .
we walk around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance @-@ Parties
we sing and play ball .
we sm@@ plat@@ inum so@@ f@@ enb@@ las@@ en .
here I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly , ab@@ sent and confused .
I always go to my mobile phone .
yet it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how one lives , and the sum@@ s of the universe met me .
I play and play until I wonder : why did we ever hear with the games ?
you can also say it ! they always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me to nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dream .
there you will be right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et &apos;s figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my babies want to play at the most at a maximum of 15 minutes with me until they come into something else .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a pupp@@ et@@ le or bis@@ cuit can be replaced .
and speak my teen@@ ager every 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more needs not needed .
everyone can catch a 15 minute walk , even at a bad @-@ La@@ une day !
15 minutes in the piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action .
the day is short : dinner , the children do pray .
but 15 minutes are dr@@ in !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . there must not be the children . it is true to have the tot@@ als to have a place for its soul @-@ peace .
it is not about playing with their own children . it is about pleasure ,
about the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
get the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find it out and keep it yourself .
I am not perfect in it . I we@@ aken and I vic@@ tories . friends meet , books reading , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; stands shortly for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in education when I wanted to make myself more and more .
15 minutes in the piece , why not full 15 minutes appro@@ ve ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . the sum@@ s seem to return if I am not working .
working is not working without playing .
it takes time , but after a couple of months opens up a door , the energy flows back and I find myself in my office . I hear a unknown mel@@ ody , she fulfilled me and my soul . I temp@@ ts me to new ideas . I take it in full plat@@ ser and love my job again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I love it .
I do not need it .
I am not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not me ... no more .
so@@ f@@ enb@@ las@@ en and stick@@ y finger , dinner with friends .
this is my money .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of the work is part of me , but just one part . and so I am so grateful .
it is me sn@@ ap that I am a Titan , I have never seen a Titan that is going to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to play more .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire are still burning .
the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear is my head .
the more I play , the better work I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land , which I sh@@ aken , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sw@@ inging , the more this unusual , be@@ ating , naked and new feeling of life in me are broad . no more Titan -- more !
the more I feel the same amounts , the more I know who I am .
I am a author . I think things that I aw@@ ake you to life .
that belongs to the job , that means to live his dream .
this is the dream of that job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to play more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tit@@ ans have no chance here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks nice .
I am Neuro@@ surgery in surgery .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trag@@ e@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke , or after an automobile accident .
for us Neuro@@ ch@@ ir@@ ur@@ gen it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodily organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system the patients have often ab@@ sent , severe disabilities .
that is probably the reason why I have functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neurolog@@ ist ?
a doctor , who tried to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures .
for sure , they have heard of one of the most well known , the &quot; deep@@ enh@@ ir@@ n@@ tones . &quot; thereby im@@ pl@@ ating an electro@@ de deeply in the brain to influence the circuit @-@ circles of neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function improved .
it truly is an amazing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease , suffering from severe lemon and severe pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the recovery of the brain .
to my opinion we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was conduc@@ tive and worked day and night in the staff .
often I was helping patients with skull @-@ mil@@ let trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that in skull @-@ mil@@ let trau@@ mas , the brain d@@ are will@@ ingly and the skull @-@ pressure ent@@ ails .
to save lives , one has to dimin@@ ished the skull @-@ impacts .
so one has to sometimes remove a part of a ben@@ evol@@ ent brain .
instead of throwing the ambitious brain , we decided with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyze brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to let cells grow by a tissue , is comparable with small children that are taken out of your families .
one has to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to flour@@ ish .
this is precisely what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it managed by Jean @-@ François .
in his micro@@ scope he saw him in his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you might know from the be@@ ologi@@ e@@ unterricht that stem cells un@@ mature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has tri@@ bal cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small circles of the brain .
it is surprising to preserve this type of stem cells from the surface and brain mass in the surgery .
we did a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells have stopped different .
they were slow and after a few weeks they even died .
we therefore saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but different .
we needed long to understand how they came .
they are of these cells .
these blue and red cells have hot cort@@ is@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you make 4 % of our big hir@@ n@@ rin@@ ks .
you play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of fo@@ etus , they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that it will take part in the healing of the brain , as we find it close to brain injury .
but this is not so certain .
one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source , which allows brain healing .
this is what we had to prove .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of bra@@ in@@ mass from the non@@ language range and then the cells to cultiv@@ ate exactly as Jean @-@ François .
and they subsequently mark colour in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we re@@ im@@ planted it at the dra@@ ining of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re@@ im@@ plant these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re@@ tire the same cells in the actu@@ al@@ ted brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we re@@ im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we watched that after a couple of weeks we disappeared , they go back home . space is already occupied , they are not used , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we moved to an injury and re@@ im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grow to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
the evidence to show them are these small points . these are the cells , which we as@@ pi@@ red in vit@@ ro , in the culture .
here we could not stop .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill .
they had to take food p@@ ellets from a tray .
they made it very well .
when they reached a stable skill level , we owe it in motor@@ ic Cort@@ ex to the hand@@ cor@@ c sector .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen at people , it recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously up to some degree , just as after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then attempt to recover with the help of sculp@@ tural brain mechanisms . they are reco@@ vering in a certain degree , just as with the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left they see the monkeys that reco@@ vering spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from before injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now you see when we re@@ im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were also for us very exciting results .
since this time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze them and later use it later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example at Park@@ inson .
but our dream is still to im@@ plant them to humans .
I really hope I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself .
many thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , this is wonderful , I am sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who might need it . &quot;
I in any case .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on human subjects .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two k@@ ilo@@ grams papers and forms , to under@@ go this kind of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
JB : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a very professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies . if you continue to look to the future , how many years it takes to get to hospital and this therapy will be available .
JB . this is difficult to say .
initially it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will we allow the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patient to perform treatments and evaluate the treatments if it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi@@ cent@@ red study .
one must first truly prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . JB : natural .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , thank you for visiting us and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it naturally .
we see democracy not as the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality , but as a invent@@ ories of our society .
we tend to consider it as an un@@ changing ge@@ ography .
we believe that capitalism is inev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and its great night@@ mar@@ ers in Beijing have no doubt that it is possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while policy remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy comes from us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- do not affect the austerity programmes that were realized in Greece .
in that moment , I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished , if it would change anything .
at this point , I want to introduce you an economic model for genuine democracy .
I ask you to work with me again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save us the democracy , but that we need to maintain a real and defence of democracy .
for without democracy our societies are mixed , our future and our great , new technologies are wast@@ ed .
in the subject of wast@@ age I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction , that is currently our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zw@@ ill@@ ings@@ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Schul@@ den@@ berg , who casts its long shadow over the United States , Europe , and the whole world .
we all recognise the debt of Schul@@ den@@ berg ,
yet few recognize its tender .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is , however , belongs to anxi@@ ous to invest it where it would be productive and in@@ comes where you could produce the school@@ ing and also all the things we urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months in the U.S. , England and the eurozone were assembled 3.4 tr@@ illion US dollars , investing in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial installations , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , G@@ le@@ ise , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.4 cheap US dollars sounds like a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it with the 5.@@ 1 tr@@ illion US dollars , which were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely did nothing except the dam@@ aging and the real estate prices apply .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin @-@ force capital that does not align with the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ olds in the United States , Japan and Europe , and therefore sustain@@ ing a low overall economic demand that could not invest in which they do not invest . just like Ö@@ di@@ pus father , who is out of fear , the Proph@@ ec@@ y of the O@@ rak@@ els could be true that his son would kill him if he grows .
un@@ certain the circumstances lead to bringing oil it k@@ ills him .
this is my ha@@ e with capitalism --
its extremely usi@@ ve kind . all the un@@ productive capital needs to be deplo@@ yed to further improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance these technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial to save the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but before we proceed : what do we understand by democracy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arist@@ ot@@ eles are defined democracy as the social form , in which the free and the poor controls the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy is naturally too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
but it would be an error , the status of the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to this su@@ ction .
the bottom line of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they with@@ drawn the working arms , not only the freedom of expression , but more important and crucial that they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same ball@@ ots in matters of state .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy is not held long --
like a cand@@ le , that sh@@ ines very bright , it is also quickly developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , our present liberal democr@@ acies have not their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and increased the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for the ruling .
the liberal democracy had only emerged when a complete separation of politics and economics was possible and the democratic process was incorporated into politics while the economy -- thus the world of corporations -- a democracy @-@ free zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our contemporary democr@@ acies , this separation of politics and economics began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , by opening the economy into politics and dispos@@ ed them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not at a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is because they can be in the government today and yet not in power , because the power from politics is scr@@ ap@@ ed in the economy and separated the areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I mentioned my ha@@ dern with capitalism .
if you think it &apos;s about as such a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ory animals that have so sustainable the animals , from which she nour@@ ished , that they ended up at the end therefore .
similarly , it is related to the economy that forces politics as far as the economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods will be de@@ valu@@ ated , inequality , economic demand dis@@ counted , and the managing directors of corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their enterprises .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more successful of capitalism sells the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the tw@@ ins from human labour power and the welfare of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the policies and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; ret@@ ains control , just as in ancient Athens , except for the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t very good .
the teaching of the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : working on the working arms !
capitalism does it by elimin@@ ating Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ cher through automation and robots .
the problem is , such a long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation of the tw@@ ins can be higher , the waste , and the social conflicts deeper , as is -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and take care of the re@@ union area , otherwise we end in a disease monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that lets the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements which he has brought forth , will survive --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is dis@@ solved through a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix &quot; or by something that the society is serving in &quot; Star Trek &quot; or into an high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life fr@@ utti .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what could it be like what could it look like this &quot; Star Trek &quot; -@@ like u@@ topia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar D@@ yst@@ eine ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you , in all brief , some examples .
in the field of companies : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money , while you work and in which your capital goes from a work@@ station to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter what one is currently working -- is property of those working in the company .
then all in@@ comes from capital , and from dis@@ solve and the concept of wage labor is completely ob@@ sol@@ ete .
no distinction between those that the companies belong , which do not work in it , and employees who work there that the company is not hear@@ ed . no pi@@ ev@@ ing more between capital and labour , no big g@@ aps between investment and sp@@ ar , and ultimately no empor@@ rag@@ ing tw@@ ins .
in the realm of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest newly emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of the entire humanity .
imagine that all world trade in this currency is trad@@ ed -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; into units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum that trade defic@@ it or the trade surplus value of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment remedies .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed at the Bret@@ ton Woods conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time you had not had the technical means to implement it .
today we have , in particular before the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world , which I describe to you is at the same time liberal spirit , in which it privileged people , and Marxist , because they buried the separation of capital and labor in the ru@@ bb@@ ish of history , and key@@ note , globally Key@@ n@@ esian .
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy .
will we aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we work politically politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something that I have just said is Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economics is ... do we do that , technological development will produce a massive decline in general economic demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as long @-@ term st@@ agn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from a part of Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , this is why I am a liberal Marxist , and like key@@ nes , and therefore I am also totally ra@@ yed .
BG : actually , and now we are probably also .
Y@@ V : if you are not present , one does not think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of ph@@ ilosop@@ hic explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , which said . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the supp@@ er of the Red@@ ner you have clearly said what you think of the vision of the West on China .
would you like to repeat this here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our liberal democr@@ acies , we have the s@@ emb@@ lance of democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as I said in my talk , we limited the democracy toward politics , during the area where most of it plays , -- the area of economy -- a completely non @-@ party @-@ free zone .
in a certain way , if I may say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today res@@ embles China today in the UK of the 19th century .
for -- do not remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically considered .
Liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was especially skep@@ tical for the democratic development concerned .
what one can now observe in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second one .
so China is now going to blame that which the West has done itself in the 19th century , smells of hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experiences as the Finance minister in Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sens@@ ed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how have you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appointing because we had the opportunity to start with the Eurozone a new beginning ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely for@@ f@@ eit@@ ed from the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the constant denial made that a massive ret@@ ard@@ ant line by the eurozone is running , and still runs , that threat@@ ens the development of the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity , based on Greek proposal -- the way , the first proposal that this denial was reve@@ aling -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to do . unfortunately , the powers within the eurozone , within the Europ@@ group , continue to deny the denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to preserve a economic system which is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism to preserve life , one will perhaps be able to delay a while , but when the change occurs , it happens to ab@@ rupt and destructive .
BG : what changes do you look ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as a Finance Minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriously ...
if there is a Finance Minister , or any Minister , who after 6 months in office , particularly in such a ten@@ se situation , he did not make any mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for renewal of the debt program in late February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they just wanted to bring our government to us only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the ship@@ ments they were finished by the eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to conc@@ ede that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our rated GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Troika @-@ makers who raised this policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a col@@ os@@ s@@ ant error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive table of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves .
my biggest fear is that the eurozone is not survived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for when they are not survived , the acqu@@ itted pin@@ see will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not alone for Europe to be disast@@ rous consequences , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to strike the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 ating that it seems to me it will be as det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price , most have never heard before , although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is going on the decision that Roy did three years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price is conduc@@ tors at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ production firm of Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because it is responsible for making the shows and contents up to the Amazon .
of course this is a very hard @-@ cont@@ est@@ ed industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy did not choose any one .
he has to find shows , which are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find Shows that are at the very right of this bend .
this curve is the assessment division of over 2500 TV series on the I@@ MD@@ B website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are received this review .
when your show is rated at nine and higher , then this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad &quot; , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , ad@@ dic@@ tive , where , after being killed a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here is here at that end , shows like &quot; Tod@@ d@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough that at this end of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price does not take a curve on the left side of the curve , because I think you have already special intelligence to offer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tod@@ d@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he does more think about the mean clearing , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t delight .
so he has to make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it is also the first time Amazon makes such a thing , so Roy Price does not want to risk .
he wants to create successes .
he requires a guaranteed success , so he keeps a contest .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and is chosen by evaluating eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes it online where they can watch everyone for free .
and if Amazon ad@@ mitt@@ edly cut out things , you do not take hold of it correctly ?
millions of spect@@ ators look around these episodes .
however they do not know they are watching at the start of those shows .
you will be watching by Roy and his team who take everything .
you record , when to start the show when you start your pieces , which parts you ski@@ ps respectively .
they collect millions of data to then decide which show them should be produced .
in fact , they gather the data , process this and it is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
you made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 , and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- so something above average but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it but he makes it different .
instead of holding a contest , he and his team ch@@ ew@@ ed up the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x spect@@ ators , so the reviews they show the shows , the course of which shows them , etc .
then use this data to find out these small details about the viewers : what shows they like , what producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a wagon and decided to do not make a Sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ator , but a drama series about a transm@@ itter .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 review on this turn . so exactly where they wanted .
of course the question is : what has happened here ?
one has two very skilled , data sav@@ vy .
they link these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for another company .
why is this that ?
because the logic somehow states that that should work with everything .
if one colle@@ cts millions of data , for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you optimized it by very powerful computers .
the min@@ de@@ ste , what you can expect is good TV , or ?
if data analytics does not work , then it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time where we find more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond the television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health System ?
none . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health system is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever get in touch with this software . come with it in touch , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail here in the United States and ask for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is made or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this Data Analysis , despite the many data ,
not always produced the best results . that is not because a company such as multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the data iss@@ ful companies are sometimes wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
2009 Google announced that through data analysis of flu , the worse way predic@@ tions - through data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature &quot; was published .
it worked impeccable , year round year until it suddenly failed to work more effectively ,
and nobody was able to say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data sav@@ our@@ ced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand anything .
despite all these errors p@@ ending data in decisions of life a -- at work , with the enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted gen@@ etics - an area where some very smart people can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy .
or the development of a medication . over the years I have realized a few patterns regarding the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
have you ever solve a complex problem , do basically do two things :
as a first cut out this problem into its parts , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second @-@ house you set up the items again to summar@@ ize a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : to take apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to cr@@ ush a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to compos@@ e the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we own it all : our brain .
when there is something where the brain is well , it is parts and pieces to compos@@ e again , even if the information is incomplete so that the brain is an expert .
that is why I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds to take them in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , what else would not have been able to do . but the decision , how to take all these parts , and draw a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; which does not stand in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a great personal risk with that decision .
on the other hand , Amazon did this in the wrong way .
they use the data to control all their decisions , first when they chose TV @-@ ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they say to us the dates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool and in order not to forget , this device is fairly useful .
many of you will be ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- precisely here at this moment .
I will be able to demo it with a technology demo .
I met some decisions in my life until now I could have listened to the ball .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace the data by something much broader , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic super@@ structure .
thus maybe the ball will cr@@ amp@@ ly and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it lies in us , making decisions , if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this as very reve@@ aling message that despite the great amount of data is still paying , decisions to meet , an expert in what you do and may consider risks .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you end up at the right end of the bend .
thanks nice .
