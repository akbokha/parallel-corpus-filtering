<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize at the New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone had heard about Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he pointed most spectacular that the NSA has illegally heard of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should give a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">Therein, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence holding in which the CIA was literally overexposed to Iran to an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, you can read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an unbelievable story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who that Chapter didn't get off?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has established around Risen and called him to call its alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this move he became a symbol for the pattern of government, whistle-blowers to judge and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Treaty, the media have the right to provide secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right when media does not get this information and if the identity of the Mug can not be protected that they will disclose.</seg>
<seg id="14">So as the government at Risen, he did something that many brave reporter had already done before him: he refused and told that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">So between 2007 and 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the process, something exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, even though they were for years that it is essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to deer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporter and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of taking place and bring rise to the statements, they could also settle their digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigator, without his consent, his telephone calls are being kept secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just as your e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit agreement, and even travel documents with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they took used to judge Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risk of risk.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is just one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblowers, but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is home to much of her work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of that a whistleblowers went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "we therefore put the press work in the game, which is to be protected by the first Constitutional Treaty, because the government has more and more possibilities to cling everyone." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology has allowed the government to cope with the rights of repression, the press may also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">While they are able to contact them from the moment in which they record, instead of entering, in a witness.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that had not yet been written as a resignation had written his book and it is much more secure than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source coverage system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the Internet known Aaron Swartz, which was developed today from the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news page, just as those here are the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information as in any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news Agency will have access to.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot provide more information secretly, and many of the information they would ask would not be available from the start.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "SecureDrop is but only a small part of the whole, to protect the press freedom in the 21st century." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world develop new spying technologies that endanger us all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is to us to ensure that not only technology-denominator, like Edward Snowden have the opportunity to concede misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower.</seg>
<seg id="39">The about iniquities in the supply of soldiers confessors knows and of crowded hospitals, the alarm goes to contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet insiders that warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the largest datagle of history has been published.] [the "Panama Papers" was released [that] [we] [see] Robert Palmer of Global Witness.] [what does that mean?] [we bate Robert Palmer of Global Witness about an explanation.] This week we were reported by messages about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mosma Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse of the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to firms such as Mospack Fonseca go and say: "okay, we need an anonymously company. can you setup?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works, how it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has been resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a allies of the brutal dictator bhar al-Assad approach in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is arguing that a track of 2 billion US dollars will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin, using a close friend of childhood agen, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now, there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous to the next release and the next unrazed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">It sounds like the plot of a hump assistant or a John-Grisham-Romans.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we handle what?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens, not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, a global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and to hide your assets -- something that we have been discussed and unveiled for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people this whole world seems very confusing, and it is hard to understand how these controllers work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it like a matzjoch cliff.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it nearly impossible to truly understand who is behind these security.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for criminal law and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really understanding what matters is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are less reports of this matter in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent American people in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who place their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But due to the principle after which these tax havens function, Mosma Fonseca has less American buyers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we would have a data bank from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples which have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some US states you need less information, less info must be stated in order to start a company than to get a librarian.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of inconsistency in the US has allowed employees to depart school children's school.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scams to scissure especially appealing feeder.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affect us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered soldier in the offices of 13 AngutsCompanies in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as a African Minister who wanted to bring money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">So, it really shocked us that all the ones until a lawyer made our investigator suggestions as he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all occurrences. none of these lawyers participated as clients, and of course not to pass any money to anyone. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual accidents.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single attorney, who has underlined the proposals.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top politic, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make these kinds of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very dimples as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing ever changed, as if it is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But when it is born, I really see that some things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the past few years, we have seen plenty of more transparency for concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU captured in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who is controlled it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US lagging behind this.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a bill introduced in both parliamentary committees, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama's disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, as a means of providing greater transparency in the United States and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Widness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headcompanies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy that rise up and saying," "" "Intransparency is not good for the business" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and apply for this to end this kind of inconsistency with laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can make the inconsistency that now allow this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally ending." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story as I almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazowment would be.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I had finished my design study, I made a backyard selling.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed there and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He sold one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made just a road trip all the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him," "" "Where do you put it tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What is it now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Must I offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would come to the peacekeeping thing, but I don't know if he is planning the really plans. I don't want to land in the trunk of a break!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small box!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself:" "" "I have a lilo. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "one voice in my mind said," "" "How to please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was then in bed, I stared to the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what did I see on there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wildthirsty in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a lot of fear that I got out of bed, on the door of the door and shut down my sleeping door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he had purchased from me now depends in his classroom. he is now teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my viewpoint.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe people who were sold to me in childhood as foreigners, actually friends, who waited only on waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress, it became normal for me. as I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommate draws, and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it, be afraid to transform it into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something about it. our apartment will stay in a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, WLAN and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and founded so "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy Guards were allowed to sleep at us for twenty dollars on the air mattress at wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They thought it was great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese leg roomettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all the city. as we all passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Starrten Brian and I attended.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rental?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came in roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">Thus we presented our Investors: "we want to create a web site where people can post publicly images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their baths -- the type rooms, whose doors can be closed when you visit.</seg>
<seg id="139">On the internet they can then invite wildly people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">Indeed they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still completely at Trost, would invest in a shop, stranger stranger to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children all have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If one has a problem, one occupied himself on the things that you can do. we could desigate.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics - it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to designate objects but now we wanted to do with design immense trust between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford to do something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create confidence with Design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I want to give you an cost of what degree confidence we claim.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you from your comforgeone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now, I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlock on your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quietly indulge of panic that you are feeling now -- -- is exactly what hosts are experiencing, when they open the door the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the interlocking phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also most guests feel when they sleep elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only sometimes so, who actually has Al Gores Handy?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you tell us on Twitter that he is responsible for the president of the president?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had been introduced only once with his name; if he had told, whence he comes, how his dog or his children would be called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 evaluations, which all say, "he can really very well originate handmays!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would have to post your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-designed feedback system strengthens the trust decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made a lot of things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to give negative evidence.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end we decided to wait for both host and guest departments, before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study with Stanford. we studied how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are to age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people most we are most like.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the more we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social biased.</seg>
<seg id="181">Thrilling is when you add the call of a person -- in our case through judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">When you have less than three evaluations, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But you have more than ten, changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stipulated similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can thus help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we learned that confidence is dependent on how much you get from themselves.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reaction to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">When you tell too little, as for example "Hi!" if you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">One gets too much, as for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is not accepted more likely.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal level of openness, e.g. "Tolle art works in your apartment! I make holiday with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to establish a level of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text area to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"" "" "" "our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices towards foreigners." ""</seg>
<seg id="194">What we hadn't reckoned was the great amount of people who were more than willing to discourage these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people will take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the indefatigable work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that was not covered previously.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the shop is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Naturally there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have no parties allowed parties or dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I collaborated in customer service. all calls-calls arrived directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when faith was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it is already hurting when I just think.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the rufer, was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, by the 123 million nights only a fraction of the problem had ever been a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trust each other too right.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, it may arise wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His landlord was driving him in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even pending blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who tend to be dured due to sealing activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are true guardian angels who can save lives right even though they do not know at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one of your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without computed the Extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course not every stay goes down.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind pure money transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled about this concept for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">"" "" "" "this is about an economic trade." ""</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but now it is simply" "" "car industry" "", "the thing is not fair." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">"" "" "" "Share" "" "describes trade, promising human relationships." ""</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of themselves openly and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel nowadays, this is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but therefore less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would be if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place we visited, a group there would wait to complete a group there and show one in a pub drive to show that you have never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could cooking with a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to shape apartments from the ground up to the counterpart?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would share the thoughts of joint share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of loneliness and depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korean capital of Seoul, this project was already begun. many parking spaces which has belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered natives. students who were looking for a Bleibe,</seg>
<seg id="241">People conveyed to people whose children were out. they have been initiated Incubator programmes,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share of Economy. our platform alone will be guests at night 785 000 people in 191 countries as a guest at a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality there was even before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There have been similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why does our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Aside from happiness and Timing we realize that you can find the right design with the components of the trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Straight-overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think any time ever when a red Macedonian passed on to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think of when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believers? a Expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brainwashing, is a terrorist attack?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the safety check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I'm not giving you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media themselves represent that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies point: the Americans mean, most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably people do not speak to their applicants.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A seagull-fitness-fanatician,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practitioner, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga Sings, because, baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided on this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslim min. I chose the Hijab to carry my head gear.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why suppress you yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The prestige was: at that time it was a feminist Declaration of Independence, and toward the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to give me a perfect and inattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only believed the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the correlation.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thinking, asked, questioned, and believed, ultimately.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow dedication, deepened with any reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm rhythm sometimes brings me to the wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone you perceive, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived basically the "Egyptian American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had at the end of my breakfast, looked on the screen and saw the word "oilmessage."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people spranged from the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was it?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">""... I changed the television channel and heard: "" "..." Muslim terrorists "" "..."... in the name of Islam... ""... "... jihad..." ""... "... Zerbombs Mecca!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country has been attacked but in the Nu, the deeds of others changed from civil society into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start graduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as if we were speaking, so deep it went to my seat, and I feared the first time to be recognised as the Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We pulled this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I saw, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations who said," "", "" "", "" "" "" "", "" "" "Bleibt in well illuminated areas," "" "verse you not." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then there was Friday in that week -- the day where Muslims gather to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings:" "" "does not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a destination." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably worse, and I also heard about attacks on Muslims or from people who kept for Muslims in the free and cutting them.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really Brandanstops on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because those people who attacked this land had attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have triumphed the wut of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly have to explain yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to serve Muslim and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak about my church as a tumour in the body of the US.</seg>
<seg id="324">This only raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour you see as a whole and a benign tumor, one keeps only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumour in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, helpers and Olympionicles.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the termination of mosques of America be safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There might be a few parking spaces, but not the terror stop.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visiting of a mosque is to see people from other belief, and to show greater citizens' participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And like me a leader of the police in the Washington, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">The radicalization process has determined that it begins online. as a first, the person is cut off from their church, even by their family, so that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the real Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and its ideology is a traitor or by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent militants, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS had its brutality by the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="339">When Muslims, as a mother, as a person, I believe that we need to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves into their performance world by recognising them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam such as the Ku club clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons for their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you cast a look at it, it will not push them what they had" "" "Holy Scripture" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality to read these things in the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding enam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom she had spoken, she brought to silence and told her, that their anger, their sense of injustice in the world, she would only get into difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="350">"" "" "" "nothing inspired and something that had given its anger sense, it was a main target for the instrumentalization by extremists who spoke a solution." ""</seg>
<seg id="351">This vaccine presented the connection to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of applying for her anger, he showed her constructive ways for real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learnt in the mosque, she kept before joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an insight that the Islamophobia lead me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal American people?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour use of fear affects our democracy every day, on our thought freedom?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study - actually multiple neuroscientific studies -- show us: if we fear, happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept a authoritative government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study reveals: if you have been reported in testing messages in which negative about Muslims reports, they were rather military attack on Muslim countries and circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">When you look when the mood for Muslims flowed up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times but never in connection with the terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the foreground of the Iraq war and out of two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not just the natural reaction to Moslem-terror as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for the manipulation of the public to heightened the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well-informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early warsign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it perhaps as the first, but the toxic air of fear would flow to all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">While assisting collectivities, it is not just about having to explain yourself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple that lived at Chapel Hill, North Carolina where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsmen.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, and promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the hardest, generous people he knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her CV. she was astonished and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when is such a sealed young man from my quarry?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne in her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she murdered, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan who was visiting in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as in a execution, after he posted expressions against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He took eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be morally, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone on a mosque, or we remained safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We fill it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we would like to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided on the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the nursery we drove exhausting, with high pressure on the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, my shoes went out, went into prayer, and what I saw, left me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam passed an announcement, thanked and called our guests, for half of the congregated were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Atheists, faithful and non-believers who were not to attacking us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had stomach and compassion panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go for sure to be sure?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or you will join those which mean: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks nice!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say, who might suggest that you hold a TEDtalk, a way of thinking that are working with deep thinker, therefore an exception, and not rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say that deceive you. I am perfectly normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am not an exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">By looking to Muslims around the world, and I did that with the greatest ever performed study to Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am no exception in any respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">When human beings appear like an exception to the rule, then the rule is broken and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: many thanks. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Basters, stands shortly before to become a millionite business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for professional threats. possible, this is made in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-reserve surfers in our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of flying machines in France live above the audience of a six metres high tower of 1 500 bricks. several years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Through connecting flights, high speed and acceleration at the stem space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-employed structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry the loads, to deal with turmoil and generally react to nature laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today, we would like to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to cross the limits of possible in the autonomous air plane.</seg>
<seg id="415">So that a system of autonomous works, it must know collectively, where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamica Tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a spinach of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, computations on board that should do the machine.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external orders are available at the highest level e. e.g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A plane, which tries to beat two traps with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters it is efficient at the anticipating flight efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variants.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most starkers, it can float, and thus has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always one side of the downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hateckis is that they are sensitive to turmoil such as wind-busts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the plane doesn't matter in which position the optimal position can be achieved and the performance by exercise can be improved.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often provide basic abstract questions posed to the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the petty-possible number of eventful parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter is known about as machines with a thousand movable parts that compile it, to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Several decades ago, trained pilots have been flying-controlled trays, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a hapruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flies with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanical simplest remote warehouse. it was invented ago.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has an movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No clapping, hinges and Querruder, no further actuators or control-surfaces, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanical simple, happens in the inner life a lot, so that it can fly stable and moved in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Yet it does not have the elegant algorithm of the heckel. to bring it to the fly, I have to throw it correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood to throw it correctly if all of me see, is low, therefore I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is a practice in invinegar, this machine is here, the omniser with its eight propellators, a exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What do we do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">You see that it is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">In this he will receive the most acute capability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter which direction he rotated or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Naturally it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive streams of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is set in models, the rest will be learned directly from flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that at.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are once part of our everyday life, they need to be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate two-propeller aircraft engines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, a bit goes wrong -- an engine or propeller comes off, the electronics or a cordless -- can fly the machine if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by making a half plane.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration studied synthetic molds.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, co-operated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We participated as usual Micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and makes it possible with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially safe machine there would like to operate at Broadway a flying lampshade.</seg>
<seg id="464">Naturally it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the wages lies in the development and the creation of creativity.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that there are creative, clever creatures which allow it to form so spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such a structural and economic potential, the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">1,3 billion years ago in a very distant galaxie, two black holes are growing each other and faster, they turned the mass of three Sonnen in a tenth year of pure energy around.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they brighter to brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the entire known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy is not clear in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black solvers.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into the space-time frame itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We first arrange the events a time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago was a multi-sociable life on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, Saurian, people, and -- God stand with us in -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago he decided to build a group particularly muy -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech - a huge laser detector to look for gravitational-based black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought it was crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as a mad coies, so that the US National Science Foundation has financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">According to decades of development, construction, conception and extremely much hard work they built the Detector LIGO: the Laser-Interferometers Gravitational-Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following time the precision of LIGO could significantly increase significantly, which improved the performance of the output.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, it is called Advanced LIGO now.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, LIGO has started to resolve a last test run by some smaller, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, just a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliating black holes ran through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure of my todill.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that which I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on the MIT. he has studied the gravitational-waves from black solvers and their observatories like LIGO measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational shaft is a crypting in the texture of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the wave, the space and its entire content is stretched in one direction, and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate, faculty in courses lead to the theory of relativity often have a really confident dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "stretch and dusty, stretch and dusting." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves extremely weak, even ridiculous, are.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each one of us was stretched in the waves of the waves and stained. the stretching of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is called 20 Nullen after the comma, followed by a 1st depiction, one explained the LIGO staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousandth of a nuclear kernel. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGOs, hunting for the waves at the same time:" "" "the technical difficulties when building such detectors are extensive." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are educated and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years prior to his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott continues to claim, LIGO is more a ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what that means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us: face lifts, the size of your hand.</seg>
<seg id="508">That's pretty handy. for so you can make an image or map of things by reading the light around you from several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">In tones is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that mean to you particularly much:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child is about.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain properties such as keys and height, rhythm and volume, to close up to the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now she is talking to Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob put them off."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce any simple images of objects in the space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can hear their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO, the frequencies behind the audible are available in the audible section.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we transform the wavpatterns into weak, we can hear all of them literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation could tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has been very busy with Scott.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotary holes, circuit simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very fast, you hear the same dough with an additional ton change. this sounds like the Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement dividing, shapes into the wavelength.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- [Surrename Ballet] Jemand who knows what to hear, see this as the sound of -- SH:... two black solvers with each 30 facher sunk, which turn about as fast as the rods of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dichtest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces before.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">In this there is the constant meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO paves a completely new way to exploring the universe as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">This is the path we can listen to the All and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- not see -- practical or basically -- not visible.</seg>
<seg id="536">A Supernova, for example. I would like to know why mashed stars in super-novas explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the space.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes happen however at the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through, because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron, as if it were more transparent glass. the Urbang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the Urbang is covered through his own night-lights.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using Gravitational wal it should be possible to return to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen we will never see, and of whom we have no idea. things that we just discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">Indeed, LIGO found right in the first attempt of things we hadn't expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague am WITH, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that bring black holes as LIGO they are watching the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, age-old bodies from prehistoric times. black holes are so to speak for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">"" "" "" "LIGO allows us to create a totally different perspective for events in space, due to the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerge from this chaos." ""</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as precious as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a brand new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than to listen to the big bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream you with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">A while ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for a year I would say to all" "" "Yes!" "" "before I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Regardless, if it took me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I expose myself "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Would I like to speak in the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Wanted to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted I to start with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly that, woke me dreaded my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, to keep speeches, my social fear -- Puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of one word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes, my life has changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes, that my life deeply changed, on an unexpected item it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls for unexplainable reasons all. "</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress from the south.</seg>

<seg id="572">"" "she asked me if I could play with her, when I was on the go. and I said," "" "yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life-setting in my family. from there I sweeter me to always play with them as soon as you call me up. no matter what I do, or where to go, I'm still saying yes - every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Fast. I am not perfect, but I am very fond of myself very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a side-blooded side effect: only recently I understood that the "yes" -scars for playing with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a author. I think things that awakens you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I revolve television. I more productive TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for being able to spread 70 hours program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are in production simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each program offers hundreds of jobs that previously did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">We say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days at four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts at the same time: 24 episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series run together on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world run my series in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts, which I created ourselves, and not only produced, so much more so. I must find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around campfire and tell my stories to tell.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire, which burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">No, this is why I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it, because I know what you think, when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I say it to you, so that all of you work so hard to take a business or a classroom to take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I am not just sitting on the computer and imaginative and screeds, and it is true when I say, I understand that it's not going to dream during a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, everything work, everything reality, all blood, all perspiration -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work hard, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened to work there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's as if I put troops on a canvas as I was on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So when we waits a high tone, ran out a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and rational, and the best thing is the buck.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is running well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A summing starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums sounds like a busy road I could go on for ever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take when I'm asking them the sums that I'm talking about writing to me that writing me pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums - when I began with TV production, when I began to work and work and build, build, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, you cannot seek any other way according to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling that cannot be compared to size, regardless of what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it means ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of being failing.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I am not made for failure, and I just know that I love the buck.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want it to question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear one: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more the more winter there is, the more things simultaneously, the more I watch, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to succeed, the more it has to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love working, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country, which I created, the marathon, which I keep, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, floated, exaggerated, burned.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters to the truth accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single working TITLE.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">Are the children of a titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby-titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The swamp of the engine is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not loved my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as usual: the same titans work, 15 hours-days, undergone weekends, no remorse, nothing Heads, a Titan Fender, does not exist, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a Show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had a fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the marsh and the sums was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you are doing is the job you love, suddenly?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know some may think: "hay you out, blamed the author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do, you do, you are doing what you do, you love to be a teacher, a banker, a banker who doesn't feel a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how the buck feels when you stops the buck when the buck stops, who is man then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart hears, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" into a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out, late, and she says," "" "mom" "" "do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say No, when two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I must say yes to all and secondly, she did not call me" "" "kittens" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">It does not call anyone more "cookies."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan, and my sums, and here everything changes before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "mom" "" "do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters encounter this, we laugh much and I read out of the book "everbody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is excellent, because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and lack of summing, I cannot do anything except to imfit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land that I created, the marathon, which I do, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists is sticky finger and fiery kisses, delicate voices, wax sments and the song in which it's going to let go, or whatever the girl in "The kingdoms" can get started.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me does exist.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes down and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And this is not right, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay in the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working sums, the titanium-cat, this is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">When I ask you who you are, when I tell you who I am, when I'm describing the means of broadcasts and television hours and how do my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">"" "" "" "sums is not power and it is not job-specific." ""</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The genuine sums is dependent on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The Summen is the stream from the lust to lust.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">True sums ignored the pressure of the story, the anticipated tasks, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The genuine sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps I whispered with God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this in general, so that I can rid myself as a workaholic from any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the buck again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play is not a satlanise like working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I like it not to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to be at the workplace as a home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, because what kind of man works rather than being home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Once honest, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed, none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We walk around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance-Parties</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We smplatinum sofenblasen.</seg>
<seg id="735">Here I feel overwhelmingly, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always go to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">Yet it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how one lives, and the sums of the universe met me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I wonder: why did we ever hear with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! they always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you think me to naive, for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">There you will be right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet's figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My babies want to play at the most at a maximum of 15 minutes with me until they come into something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a puppetle or biscuit can be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my teenager every 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more needs not needed.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can catch a 15 minute walk, even at a bad-Laune day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes in the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children do pray.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are drin!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. there must not be the children. it is true to have the totals to have a place for its soul-peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with their own children. it is about pleasure,</seg>
<seg id="759">About the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Get the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="763">I am not perfect in it. I weaken and I victories. friends meet, books reading, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" stands shortly for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in education when I wanted to make myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes in the piece, why not full 15 minutes approve?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seem to return if I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working is not working without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a couple of months opens up a door, the energy flows back and I find myself in my office. I hear a unknown melody, she fulfilled me and my soul. I tempts me to new ideas. I take it in full platser and love my job again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums, the sums is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Sofenblasen and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my money.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of the work is part of me, but just one part. and so I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is me snap that I am a Titan, I have never seen a Titan that is going to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to play more.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my campfire are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better work I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land, which I shaken, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the canvases, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this swinging, the more this unusual, beating, naked and new feeling of life in me are broad. no more Titan -- more!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel the same amounts, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am a author. I think things that I awake you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job, that means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of that job,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>

<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgery in surgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke, or after an automobile accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us Neurochirurgen it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system the patients have often absent, severe disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I have functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurologist?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor, who tried to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">For sure, they have heard of one of the most well known, the "deepenhirntones." thereby implating an electrode deeply in the brain to influence the circuit-circles of neurons so that the neurological function improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It truly is an amazing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, suffering from severe lemon and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">To my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was conductive and worked day and night in the staff.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I was helping patients with skull-millet trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that in skull-millet traumas, the brain dare willingly and the skull-pressure entails.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save lives, one has to diminished the skull-impacts.</seg>
<seg id="816">So one has to sometimes remove a part of a benevolent brain.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the ambitious brain, we decided with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyze brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells grow by a tissue, is comparable with small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">One has to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to flourish.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is precisely what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it managed by Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">In his microscope he saw him in his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you might know from the beologieunterricht that stem cells unmature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has tribal cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small circles of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to preserve this type of stem cells from the surface and brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We did a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells have stopped different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slow and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We therefore saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand how they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They are of these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells have hot cortisin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You make 4% of our big hirnrinks.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of foetus, they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that it will take part in the healing of the brain, as we find it close to brain injury.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source, which allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">This is what we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brainmass from the nonlanguage range and then the cells to cultivate exactly as Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And they subsequently mark colour in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we reimplanted it at the draining of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we reimplant these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we retire the same cells in the actualted brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we watched that after a couple of weeks we disappeared, they go back home. space is already occupied, they are not used, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we moved to an injury and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grow to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence to show them are these small points. these are the cells, which we aspired in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we owe it in motoric Cortex to the handcorc sector.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen at people, it recovered spontaneously up to some degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then attempt to recover with the help of sculptural brain mechanisms. they are recovering in a certain degree, just as with the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left they see the monkeys that recovering spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance from before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now you see when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also for us very exciting results.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since this time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example at Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them to humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who might need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I in any case.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on human subjects.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms papers and forms, to undergo this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a very professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies. if you continue to look to the future, how many years it takes to get to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB. this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">Initially it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will we allow the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patient to perform treatments and evaluate the treatments if it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicentred study.</seg>
<seg id="897">One must first truly prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting us and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it naturally.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see democracy not as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as a inventories of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as an unchanging geography.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism is inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and its great nightmarers in Beijing have no doubt that it is possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while policy remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy comes from us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup unequivocally that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- do not affect the austerity programmes that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">In that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends told me that democracy would be abolished, if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I want to introduce you an economic model for genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you to work with me again to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save us the democracy, but that we need to maintain a real and defence of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are mixed, our future and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">In the subject of wastage I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, that is currently our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "Zwillings"" "" paradox "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="916">A top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Schuldenberg, who casts its long shadow over the United States, Europe, and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognise the debt of Schuldenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">Yet few recognize its tender.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is, however, belongs to anxious to invest it where it would be productive and incomes where you could produce the schooling and also all the things we urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months in the U.S., England and the eurozone were assembled 3.4 trillion US dollars, investing in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial installations, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, Gleise, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 cheap US dollars sounds like a lot of money, until one compares it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely did nothing except the damaging and the real estate prices apply.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin-force capital that does not align with the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than one quarter of the 25-54 year-olds in the United States, Japan and Europe, and therefore sustaining a low overall economic demand that could not invest in which they do not invest. just like Ödipus father, who is out of fear, the Prophecy of the Orakels could be true that his son would kill him if he grows.</seg>
<seg id="925">Uncertain the circumstances lead to bringing oil it kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hae with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely usive kind. all the unproductive capital needs to be deployed to further improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance these technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial to save the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">"" "" "" "but before we proceed: what do we understand by democracy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles are defined democracy as the social form, in which the free and the poor controls the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy is naturally too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">But it would be an error, the status of the athenic democracy due to this suction.</seg>
<seg id="934">The bottom line of the Athenian democracy was and is that they withdrawn the working arms, not only the freedom of expression, but more important and crucial that they gave them the right to political co-determination with the same ballots in matters of state.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy is not held long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, that shines very bright, it is also quickly developed.</seg>
<seg id="937">"" "" "" "however, our present liberal democracies have not their roots in the ancient Athens," ""</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and increased the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for the ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy had only emerged when a complete separation of politics and economics was possible and the democratic process was incorporated into politics while the economy -- thus the world of corporations -- a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">"" "" "" "in our contemporary democracies, this separation of politics and economics began, a relentless struggle between the two, by opening the economy into politics and disposed them." ""</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not at a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"" "" "" "it is because they can be in the government today and yet not in power, because the power from politics is scraped in the economy and separated the areas." ""</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hadern with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think it's about as such a herd of predatory animals that have so sustainable the animals, from which she nourished, that they ended up at the end therefore.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is related to the economy that forces politics as far as the economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods will be devaluated, inequality, economic demand discounted, and the managing directors of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="948">"" "" "" "the more successful of capitalism sells the" "" "demos" "" "[the people] from democracy, the higher the twins from human labour power and the welfare of humanity." ""</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the policies and the economy, and it would be better if the "Demos" retains control, just as in ancient Athens, except for the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn't very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor regain a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: working on the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by eliminating Niedricher through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, such a long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation of the twins can be higher, the waste, and the social conflicts deeper, as is -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "so we have to reunite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and take care of the reunion area, otherwise we end in a disease monitoring hyperautocracy that lets the film" "" "matrix" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements which he has brought forth, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is dissolved through a dystopia, similar to the "matrix" or by something that the society is serving in "Star Trek" or into an high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks the meaning of life frutti.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what could it be like what could it look like this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" -similar Dysteine?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you, in all brief, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money, while you work and in which your capital goes from a workstation to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter what one is currently working -- is property of those working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all incomes from capital, and from dissolve and the concept of wage labor is completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those that the companies belong, which do not work in it, and employees who work there that the company is not heared. no pieving more between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and spar, and ultimately no emporraging twins.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the realm of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest newly emerging countries], in the interest of the entire humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that all world trade in this currency is traded -- we call it "the cosmos," into units of "cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum that trade deficit or the trade surplus value of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment remedies.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed at the Bretton Woods conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time you had not had the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have, in particular before the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world, which I describe to you is at the same time liberal spirit, in which it privileged people, and Marxist, because they buried the separation of capital and labor in the rubbish of history, and keynote, globally Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we work politically politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something that I have just said is Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economics is... do we do that, technological development will produce a massive decline in general economic demand, which is called Larry Summers as long-term stagnation. "</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from a part of Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is correct, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, this is why I am a liberal Marxist, and like keynes, and therefore I am also totally rayed.</seg>

<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">"" "" "" "in our liberal democracies, we have the semblance of democracy." ""</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my talk, we limited the democracy toward politics, during the area where most of it plays, -- the area of economy -- a completely non-party-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain way, if I may say that provocative, China today resembles China today in the UK of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- do not remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially skeptical for the democratic development concerned.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can now observe in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second one.</seg>
<seg id="999">So China is now going to blame that which the West has done itself in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy.</seg>

<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>

<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">"" "" "" "this is going on the decision that Roy did three years ago." ""</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is conductors at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production firm of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a Igelfrisur and describes himself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because it is responsible for making the shows and contents up to the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-contested industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy did not choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows, which are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find Shows that are at the very right of this bend.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the assessment division of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are received this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">When your show is rated at nine and higher, then this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad", "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows, addictive, where, after being killed a season, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here is here at that end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- this should tell you enough that at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price does not take a curve on the left side of the curve, because I think you have already special intelligence to offer" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He does more think about the mean clearing, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't delight.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available, and of course it is also the first time Amazon makes such a thing, so Roy Price does not want to risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He requires a guaranteed success, so he keeps a contest.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and is chosen by evaluating eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes it online where they can watch everyone for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon admittedly cut out things, you do not take hold of it correctly?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators look around these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However they do not know they are watching at the start of those shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You will be watching by Roy and his team who take everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record, when to start the show when you start your pieces, which parts you skips respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to then decide which show them should be produced.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they gather the data, process this and it is the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four Republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">You made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">There is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7,4, and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- so something above average but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time with another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it but he makes it different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a contest, he and his team chewed up the existing data about the Netflix spectators, so the reviews they show the shows, the course of which shows them, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use this data to find out these small details about the viewers: what shows they like, what producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they entered a wagon and decided to do not make a Sitcom over four Senator, but a drama series about a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 review on this turn. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very skilled, data savvy.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They link these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for another company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is this that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic somehow states that that should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If one collects millions of data, for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimized it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The mindeste, what you can expect is good TV, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analytics does not work, then it is a bit scary because we live in a time where we find more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond the television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health System?</seg>
<seg id="1091">None. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health system is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever get in touch with this software. come with it in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the United States and ask for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this Data Analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always produced the best results. that is not because a company such as multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data issful companies are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">2009 Google announced that through data analysis of flu, the worse way predictions - through data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success in a publication in the magazine "Nature" was published.</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked impeccable, year round year until it suddenly failed to work more effectively,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody was able to say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data savourced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors pending data in decisions of life a -- at work, with the enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics - an area where some very smart people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I have realized a few patterns regarding the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Have you ever solve a complex problem, do basically do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a first cut out this problem into its parts, so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second-house you set up the items again to summarize a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: to take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to crush a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to compose the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we own it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">When there is something where the brain is well, it is parts and pieces to compose again, even if the information is incomplete so that the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That is why I think, Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds to take them in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, what else would not have been able to do. but the decision, how to take all these parts, and draw a show like "House of Cards," which does not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a great personal risk with that decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">On the other hand, Amazon did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They use the data to control all their decisions, first when they chose TV-ideas, then they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "they say to us the dates." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool and in order not to forget, this device is fairly useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- precisely here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will be able to demo it with a technology demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I met some decisions in my life until now I could have listened to the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace the data by something much broader, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic superstructure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">Thus maybe the ball will cramply and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it lies in us, making decisions, if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very revealing message that despite the great amount of data is still paying, decisions to meet, an expert in what you do and may consider risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you end up at the right end of the bend.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks nice.</seg>
