Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards , which change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people are to meet today .
a pit @-@ chapel , where now is du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn @-@ tunnel .
small@@ gar@@ dener manage the first cause of farmers .
the oldest official card mou@@ ths promotes exciting stories about days .
it is nervous when maps are not currently up @-@ to @-@ date .
this knows each one had to look at exciting , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed rather than a di@@ vest@@ ment road a green meadow .
the historic maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als of Bavaria of the State government , are anything but current - yet very reve@@ aling .
especially when you compare it with current online cards .
then it is clearly how cities and villages in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ chner @-@ Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a Flick@@ r@@ ep@@ p@@ ich , which one cannot recognise as such .
in the large picture @-@ postcard for cities and municipalities are detailed cards , so @-@ called Ur@@ als sheets , incorporated .
this generation came according to the Bay@@ er@@ isches Ver@@ mess@@ ungs@@ administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and , at the beginning of the first Ver@@ messung of Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader inv@@ aded Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War of Aggression with Austria .
Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave a to@@ po@@ graphic record of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops went off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , from 9 February 18@@ 01 , there were today &apos;s neighbors , which formed the idea of a region @-@ wide Bayern @-@ Show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max . Joseph drove the project further forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to@@ po@@ graphic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and therefore the Bav@@ arian Ver@@ mess@@ enger @-@ administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the utility sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like to find all the others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of fruits / Today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is sub@@ missions that appears in the map of 18@@ 56 still relatively isolated .
ship@@ pers was divided into 21 years after creation of the map , thus 1877 , as Mün@@ chner district .
today , sub@@ send@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses sub@@ missions are concentrated in 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after 1878 by Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the insur@@ rection of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 .
where today is the western park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : at Hin@@ einz@@ o@@ omen a small @-@ part@@ ying map with do@@ zens lines and numbers : hand@@ written number@@ ed fl@@ yers are derived from the so @-@ called &quot; urine &quot; from which the property tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots show there today no farmers show more - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; petty @-@ gar@@ dener &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land in the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green space is built north of sub@@ missions .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 sw@@ ing@@ place of the Okto@@ ber@@ f@@ ests , was in the 19th century actually a meadow - and no concrete .
on the other side of Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychi@@ atric medicine .
in the first position one reads in the district of today &apos;s District Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only the street named &quot; at Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the ascent &quot; On the Lü@@ ang &quot; but also in big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse , you once again bet people with mad@@ ide@@ als .
in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ chner Kreis @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ ame &quot; was created on the Au@@ er fan . &quot;
since 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den appointed the institution - that psychiat@@ r@@ ist in connection with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was kno@@ w@@ ned for his time and ended up for example the Ank@@ hing of the so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is also forbidden to apply force to the passengers , to apply force against the in@@ m@@ ates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has worked for an exhibition with the Anst@@ alt Museum .
for 280 patients there was first place , later it was expanded to 500 places .
sometime , this capacity is no longer considered - the reason for the construction of the cycles in hair of 1905 .
there has been the Is@@ ar Am@@ per @-@ East @-@ East in Munich since 2006 , one of the biggest psychiat@@ rists in Germany .
on the site of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt now young people meet in the Mün@@ chner Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order de@@ war@@ ns the building complex 1920 and walked him in a youth @-@ home with training programs .
West is located the football field of TS@@ V Munich east , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , you set up the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; - in the architectural culture based on the origin of the Irish mat , which was destroyed during the Second World War by bom@@ bing ra@@ ils .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was in 18@@ 56 as the main square , &quot; the department name was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War even in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies took many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a great stayed until today - at Mari@@ enhof .
the English institute , small business houses and a pit @-@ chapel from the Middle Ages was once the Mari@@ enhof where these days were working and on 5 April 2017 the Sp@@ at@@ enst@@ ich took place for the second S @-@ Bahn .
the old Munich @-@ Card can be compared with the air @-@ image of today - and the hole at the Mari@@ enhof can be arranged .
Om@@ bud@@ sman released before travel @-@ up for Miss@@ our@@ i
the national association to promote far@@ ther has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Miss@@ our@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory politics and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Consult@@ ation to the State of Miss@@ our@@ i , which should come into force on August 28 , 2017 and take great care when travelling through the state , where a series of frag@@ ile , bre@@ aches @-@ based pre @-@ sei@@ zu@@ res may occur in the whole state and described here , &quot; stated in the opinion of the Group .
a recently passed law by Miss@@ our@@ i , which makes it more difficult to fight discrimination , as well as the prosec@@ ution of the state , the dis@@ proportion@@ ate to minorities , promp@@ ted the group to release travel warning said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , people happen .
they are raised because of their skin colour , they are assembled or killed , &quot; said the President of Miss@@ our@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we listen to complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
the group f@@ law@@ ed inci@@ dents like r@@ assi@@ stic hi@@ kes against black students at the University of Miss@@ our@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under un@@ worthy circumstances at the beginning of the year , after having no pet@@ rol surveillance during the trip through the state and taken into cust@@ ody by the police by Miss@@ our@@ i , without a crime .
the Council also pointed to a recent report of the office of the general State @-@ old from Miss@@ our@@ i , in which it is shown that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more frequently to be hal@@ ted as wheat .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff can inform about what could happen in Miss@@ our@@ i , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be willing to bring Cau@@ cas@@ ing or let their relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miss@@ our@@ i recorded 100 hate speech in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the Hass@@ ver@@ bre@@ d reporting period of F@@ BI , which entered the state with respect to the number of such injury on the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Miss@@ our@@ i law that would make it more difficult to complain a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Society ( AC@@ LU ) travel openings for Texas and Arizona , after the States immig@@ rant laws were adopted , after the States immig@@ rant laws were obliged to susp@@ end people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to the further r@@ attle regulation on the AC@@ LU on additional r@@ attle regulation .
travel openings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries but in recent times , interested parties have had a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States .
Wei@@ discreet project is Ele@@ ar
the fisher@@ bacher Wei@@ ghts project is a success project and continues to be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundest@@ ags Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have gained a picture on the spot .
in the case of the founder of Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the fisher@@ bacher CD@@ U region met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann confirmed first insights into its operation , in which it houses 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cattle , and as many young people , and houses five apartments of Feri@@ eng@@ ths .
the &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ ald@@ mil@@ ch &quot; is for him the altern@@ ator ver@@ gre@@ gate for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ es there is only regional .
as he is also the BL@@ H@@ V president of Fis@@ bach , he described the hamlet project as &quot; Ele@@ mental important . &quot;
I can not manage on such levels surfaces any profit .
the green space is prepared for a lot of work , much m@@ uses with the motor sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and with the Top@@ ography &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the el@@ event@@ ual operation and managing these without chemical plant protection and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he does not lead to bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognised the importance of the Wei@@ gh@@ ing project and is pleased with the leader of the leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers must be supported at costs of 3000 to 4000 Euro per h@@ ect@@ are .
we hope that the fo@@ rest@@ ation of the surfaces can be with@@ drawn even a whole while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure that we have , people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how to continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often due to encour@@ agement
about the Wei@@ ghts promotion , a total of 25 plots from eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the disclosure area is 40 hectares , which should not be aff@@ o@@ rested by at least 20@@ 23 .
the total cost of the total cost of 71 500 Euro was funded half over leaders , a quarter carried away the municipality of Fis@@ bach .
thus , farmers left the farmer 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometers of wheat .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac said : &quot; you do not make a really good job , without farmers and women , it does not go . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter White stood firm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here best food produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ s@@ Leave &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of wheat comp@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
the presence of one of the L@@ PR test@@ ers by the L@@ PR .
furthermore , the enclosed area may not be appropriate ( Hang@@ ing over 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened by the rebel@@ lion .
for the fisher@@ bacher Wei@@ gh@@ aun@@ ching project 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots that would like to cut nearly 16 kilometres fence .
the disclosure area covers 35 hectares , the calculated cost is more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump becomes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime transfer is when they begin to att@@ acking the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the most careful fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ a Place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key @-@ ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , knew surely what he did , when he took a symbolic Ax@@ t in a heat conflict with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the proposals by the president to dra@@ stic limitation of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller accessed not the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of ship@@ owners and Liberty Im@@ it@@ ators would have accum@@ ulated him if he would have done it .
but he laid their significance in , and in particular the meaning that you have been written , when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will not go here in a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that en@@ light@@ ens the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the poem which you refer to which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tu@@ ally correct , but as it did not form@@ ulate it , it is not really about history .
it is about contemporary reson@@ ance on the rag@@ ging words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your exhausted masses , who are longing into inhal@@ ing , free to breathe the fall of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time in which the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; el@@ ong@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our scre@@ ens was better to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller dedicated himself not to liter@@ ary cr@@ iti@@ que - it clearly made that these people are not welcome in the USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict with the significance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends , who campa@@ ign@@ ed to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that it is accomplished a top political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ism by placing the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a ab@@ used classical representation .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no more abstract - she has got a voice .
and she gives himself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the link of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devast@@ ating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just like Laz@@ arus , the importance of the statue changed , people from the right wing had long restra@@ ined this long ago .
the big scre@@ am R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John of the B@@ apt@@ ist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was no one , but rather an early Ne@@ oc@@ on that bring the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is prog@@ ressing .
she is supposed to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ack@@ el should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ er@@ gh on something encountered .
the meaning of the statue is totally and even a question of the point of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative effect of Laz@@ arus consisted of seeing them as they from the exhau@@ stive but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships has been seen .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of men who are looking for refu@@ ge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome which they must hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump will ever wish to recognise .
their tor@@ ch is not intended to en@@ ligh@@ ten the way , but the hate , who is their only source of power to ign@@ ite .
World@@ championship 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ bb@@ ish ch@@ ott@@ ish members of the United Kingdom team
E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of a time when only two vill@@ i belonged to the team of Great Britain
the performance director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ piece Scottish chec@@ ker is made for a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of sh@@ ot@@ ish athletes was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland develops something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue to continue until we find it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sham@@ ans athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilli@@ antly . &quot;
several of the Scottish Ath@@ l@@ eten are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ters - which to compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5,000 m distance while E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle was elected by the crew to the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is quite modest .
her captain talk was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or where they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were highly motivated .
the passion and genuine feeling that e@@ ast@@ ie certainly brought together were great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth of silver med@@ alli@@ sts , who will compete for the 400 @-@ m @-@ hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; incredible , &quot; that 16 vill@@ i are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total to athletes in the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the Mid @-@ River Mu@@ ir leads on this path and was placed five British and two European recru@@ its last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m runs , is another Scot@@ sman who wanted to observe the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
she is reminded of her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
the cre@@ ation@@ ist chapters says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; to the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots do not only belong to the team , but in some cases also be mer@@ ged with the medals and at the Fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special about team captain will be in it that it was elected by the other members of the team so it &apos;s a great honor to know , but knowing that my team @-@ m@@ ates have voted for me and have chosen , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to rise to poetry .
what my speech is concerned as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , because we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and to benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and compete and it &apos;ll just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
blocking reviews on Facebook : don &apos;t b@@ eil you to a public if you do not toler@@ ate the intro@@ duc@@ tory of voters
the father of our land knew something of a bad press .
the Americans de@@ ed George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspapers suggested him because of all , from internal policy up to his political principles .
he cl@@ aw in the cr@@ iti@@ que , certainly .
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid , and wor@@ dless , we shall take the sheep to s@@ laughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland at Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Hog@@ an who has to work to work more like Washington .
the employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Society compl@@ ained him therefore at the beginning of this week .
the p@@ ab of the Gover@@ nor was caused the law@@ suit as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of a bac@@ kl@@ ash with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like Hog@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second position of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Hog@@ an is not an reactionary h@@ os@@ head .
he has demonstrated a firm hand with the leadership of his state and strict adh@@ er@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as pri@@ mo@@ res means to connect with his voters and to debate his ha@@ ar@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
that is why the block@@ age of people coming on the side of the Gover@@ nor - which is a public forum , which is referred to as officially , and by collabor@@ ators who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post def@@ aul@@ ted Ho@@ an Spre@@ cher@@ in Amelia Ch@@ asse the actions of the Govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the block@@ ages of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the picture of TRO@@ LL@@ EN or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ edge people who wa@@ vered online the wh@@ ip .
the post talks with some of the real people that were blocked by Hog@@ an .
and these are just genuine people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , not a role .
they all told their comments are respectful , thought@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the pastor H@@ iti@@ ed the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ an Catholic faith .
attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not h@@ eter , but she asked to hate .
&quot; I get excited that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate speech and other current news , &quot; wrote them in the commentary area of the message sending &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take a stand on the same subject , they are believed in some people rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and recognized not as a large group of affected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the employees of the Gover@@ nor &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated Spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; would probably be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocks a cr@@ itic or a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that people have been sent to collect newspapers with critical indicators and to burn or to burn demonstr@@ ators or to silence .
but that is precisely what happened just digital .
Hog@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise it that he imp@@ lied Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump will su@@ aded by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell to Virginia last week .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County completed the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to the U.S. District Court James C. Cach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she called a vot@@ er on her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Be@@ vin ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ LU on its use by Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
currently Washington &apos;s time had a similar effect to Washington &apos;s time as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter , swal@@ lows on his leadership .
and even at that time Washington had an anonymous t@@ roll .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who use the p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ju@@ ri@@ cola &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that signed Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pet@@ itions , which critic@@ ized its position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and the shipping industry with Britain , prev@@ ailed for historical documents , which were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he has not brought her to silence .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements and dis@@ course belong to the base of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty is hoping for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for the next three days at home comfort , since the Renaissance Club will be held at East Lot@@ hi@@ an , the 25th issue of Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which resulted in the Ar@@ cher@@ field left until the end of the year , before it lost against Paul E@@ ales , is joined together with the new re@@ sig@@ nation , and acts as a tournament shar@@ eholder in the name of the association &apos;s founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved his glory with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry made a great job than he placed this place .
he is a eager advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English E@@ ales was looking forward to defending the championship for the first time , although he won his 32 @-@ year career with both the European tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; this feels really special , &quot; said the in South@@ port native players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura open as it was last year after I had won it , taken out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one we always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year , returns to the promotion of the home ground .
this event will be the first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you feel also this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid Golf .

less pul@@ mon@@ ary lo@@ gs by Passi@@ ve @-@ smoke
the last two decades has died less people because of the resistance of lung cancer .
the scientists at the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf come to a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following our estimates are attri@@ but@@ able in the year of 167 lung cancer , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said academic manager Heiko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , he was drawn up a particular study on this subject in 1994 .
at that time , there were still 400 pul@@ mon@@ ary st@@ ables due to passive store per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
hous@@ et@@ ables prove to be very complex
the construction works at the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; lie somewhat more in time , &quot; says the leader of the station Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the hous@@ pl@@ omas , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground @-@ Montag@@ nes , what is not noted in the plans .
the traffic that constantly re@@ dire@@ cts the construction works for the construction ru@@ pp of the company St@@ ump@@ p a major problem .
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of motor@@ ists from red traffic lights and lock@@ ers is already huge , &quot; says Hein@@ ze .
the road is locked and only the lin@@ i@@ enb@@ ads are entitled to a passage .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z by the company St@@ ump@@ p have been dealing with works at the bridge for weeks .
&quot; the hot days were quite busy .
but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with a cold water water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian East German
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i the dinner cook@@ s , they use no stove .
they even rarely used a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ att@@ age in the un@@ quiet ind@@ on@@ esian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually presents a sweet potato - locally as &quot; Not@@ a . &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the co@@ ed tu@@ bers is performed with ei@@ sty , un@@ washed out hands and dev@@ oured .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay land - she has no furniture - where they also performs their daily work , e.g. clothes with dr@@ ush water from the nearby sw@@ amp to wash .
a bucket in a canopy bed serves as a lat@@ ch .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , ye were not assigned a fields .
poly@@ gam@@ ie is here common .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most village men are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will cry , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life of the High@@ lands , a former Dutch colony , recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 el@@ dest should vote in front of the occupation forces .
an existing movement that stir@@ red up against the independence against the Dutch rule , turned on fast against the government of Jak@@ arta that ob@@ serves the control of the region and ex@@ cludes foreign journalists or legal observation .
in 2003 the provinces was officially distributed in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea and the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura in Nab@@ ire and then a morning @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there are no public transportation .
the city with about 19,@@ 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo and out of wave @-@ tops that have been transm@@ uted through r@@ ost in various yellow @-@ brown notes .
only a few Indon@@ esian has made their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , schol@@ ars P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , and points to their livel@@ i@@ able , hand@@ ed Tur@@ ban , her dark Hem@@ d and their bright rock .
&quot; earlier we had only sheets of our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is an Indon@@ esian province , where 28 % of men live under the poverty line and some of the worst mort@@ ality rates of children in Asia have .
but it is also Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land .
the largest and profitable gol@@ d@@ mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a skyscr@@ aper in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has built a value of 3.8 billion U.S. dollar gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has over the resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , these ri@@ ches are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua that ensure Indon@@ esian is mighty military to maintain fir@@ ing presence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a study of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local military depen@@ dents and units signed between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars by a single officer .
Pap@@ i@@ anic demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden go@@ ose and are being treated mer@@ ci@@ fully .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 pop@@ oa had been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indon@@ esian military , tor@@ tured and det@@ ained .
mass@@ ac@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as pro@@ u@@ ber@@ land in the 1970 @-@ 1980 period were referred to in compliance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission on genocide .
in the region the Indon@@ esian police in the past year more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to keep everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report by the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ bane adopted in 2016 where reports of atro@@ cities and torture - rape and electro@@ des are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal ra@@ inf@@ all of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as any week inci@@ dents happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ Explorer for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screws are reinforced , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development is changing as a Muslim economies of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ aw@@ esi come .
Jav@@ anese @-@ War@@ ming @-@ Kant@@ ines sell ground @-@ bre@@ d chicken and gado , a mixed vegetables with earth @-@ wal@@ nut .
local people fight for a meeting here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua for sale , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ a local , who moved to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; it has tasted the native pap@@ ua - the mother @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; from Pap@@ ua - their market costs . &quot;
the Indon@@ esian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign , to address the ine@@ qualities and the law breaking in Pap@@ ua .
the former Zimmermann @-@ te 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts have broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai was in fact only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October an low point .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children out and sang christ@@ mas songs from a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indon@@ esian soldiers on a motorcycle by the dark .
the sh@@ ro@@ cked children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took a breach of their tone and came back later with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had dr@@ unk , h@@ unted and sm@@ ote the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers stir@@ red into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , has been so heavily de@@ pressed that he fell into the kom@@ ma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby governmental commission set on fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves together on a football ground in front of the local police station and the military command@@ ing centre to request justice .
they bore cerem@@ onial hunting for hunting and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - in the circle ahead and a bir@@ d@@ gy im@@ iti@@ ously - from Pap@@ u@@ as mee P@@ ago @-@ trunk .
some protest@@ ers began to drag stones on police and military post .
when the mood was heated , soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they are dead , &quot; said in an official document of TIME that was not released the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the elevated risk and called for rest and demanded the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned , I was suddenly shot in my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; w@@ rists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said TIME at the ver@@ anda of his coloured wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still does not know who has folded , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fil@@ med &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; adds it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so c@@ ous@@ in , the witness of shooting was .
&quot; I went to him and under@@ went his body to safely assume that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esian only a name , the TIME in d@@ us@@ er mood .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I k@@ issed him . &quot;
the editor @-@ spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said re@@ por@@ ters that his officers would only want to secure their station , &quot; because they will be attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Hor@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others inju@@ red .
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings came only the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; after Jak@@ arta .
three weeks spent Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura a passionate speech , in which he vo@@ iced sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and vo@@ iced the historical mis@@ eries in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want that this case will be resolved right away , so that the future will no longer happen in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
security @-@ Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he should include a foreign policy mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations .
but the words began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most bre@@ aches are a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 @-@ er years .
the point is that we have committed to approach these violations , but there are processes that must be under@@ going through , &quot; he said .
then he made a retreat when he talked with TIME at 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TIME and said , he did not plan any plans in Pap@@ ua to establish a complaint mechanism .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
furthermore , the UN had indic@@ ted the UN for crimes against humanity , called &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua were already included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with gri@@ ev@@ ism .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; says he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have anxi@@ ous to be arrested by the military , I fear to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us reiter@@ ated the opinion that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fears to discuss the incident .
he says he was be@@ aten by the military after he helped du@@ g four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police were on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring an un@@ conscious man to the hospital , died a person and 17 others have been inju@@ red , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ w@@ ned when he caught in a nearby river caught , died on the way to the hospital .
win@@ ed vill@@ agers protest@@ ed before the s@@ iting office of the company .
the police said that the vill@@ agers had stones at the officers , who were re@@ acting by war@@ med by war@@ ts .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian par@@ am@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and put it a deadly .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Badi@@ i who lives near the hospital and stuff , as the ship@@ pers were consumed rapidly , so the TIME .
&quot; I have hidden two days hidden in my house . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai parliament called to hold the officers &quot; account and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the Police from the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai has always been a glorious government for the Indon@@ esian government .
the lack of sensu@@ al development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribe , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green lands of Pap@@ ua .
many adh@@ ered to the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua , trying to inspire spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and ab@@ duc@@ tions of Indon@@ esian soldiers .
some of the Top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to these past years , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years , and are arbitr@@ arily taken into awareness , under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing national sovereignty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some will never dive again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty increases the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is no matter of range .
people here build up everything they eat : above all not@@ a and fruit and leaf .
agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold in the local market .
ten pieces not@@ a tast@@ ers only 10,000 Indon@@ esian Ru@@ pi@@ as ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native pap@@ ua and the new migrants have risen since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire in larger number .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary ability to lead their own companies competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in keeping in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the tribe of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
insul@@ ating the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
beyond that , restrictions of the coverage of international media are ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ es and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of poor coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was granted to films .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the dep@@ uty Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is Elec@@ tions , to raise the limitations of the reporting , to promote transparency and development , not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new threats to foreign journalists who try to report from Indon@@ esian on the most eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa @-@ denial , and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six pa@@ zi@@ fish states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ seln and the Sal@@ om@@ onen @-@ Inseln - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and wide spread injury &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ op@@ erei .
the same countries have historically viewed O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Foreign Minister Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed out the re@@ sig@@ nation of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights . &quot;
local people want to take note of more foreign governments .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right amb@@ assador K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also took part in the session but will remain anonymous .
Indonesia also has a presidential election but the Pap@@ ua say that they probably will not fit again for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are engaged in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Scho@@ ols , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the tribe of the tribe .
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is living under the constant threat of a peasant army , resi@@ des in arm@@ chair and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ People , like other Pap@@ ua , to consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; that he must rep@@ ay .
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ation , families of Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ use@@ offering a last symbolic act of the d@@ ope : the cor@@ pse of a sl@@ ain was buried on a terrain just opposite the police and the military station .
they might not know that perhaps justice will come up , but at least they have not forgotten their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with s@@ lan@@ ted head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; skyscr@@ aper from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest floor towers of the world in Dubai his dictionary and forced hundreds of residents , from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ sto@@ rey building to escape .
it is the second fire that was swe@@ pt in only two years through the high @-@ house , which you can random@@ ly called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injury were reported none , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we are wo@@ unded at the fire@@ case and scre@@ aming people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor to down , &quot; told a resident that had its name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dub@@ ay Local authorities said that the units of the Fire Protection against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00.00 pm ) the fire ext@@ ingu@@ ished and the building cool@@ ed down .
the government said that they work in providing accommodation for those concerned .
the incident can ask questions about safety of materials , which are used in areas of skyscr@@ apers all over the world .
a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building on whose fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damages from the fair@@ ing , the outdoors , for decor@@ ating or insulation .
in the UK , the police said she believes that the system of plates to insulation and disgu@@ ise at the London Gren@@ fell &apos;s London Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a bran@@ ding , with the approximately 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Court of tennis ( IT@@ F ) has been replaced with his big Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the for this sport @-@ revolutionary suggestion , Davis Cup @-@ single was only supported on two winn@@ ings , skin @-@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
this is often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ set @-@ classics remaining the traditional competition .
6@@ 3,@@ 54 per cent of member states were voted in favour of reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore just nar@@ rati@@ fied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our membership nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty .
one will continue to work to improve the application .
it was not only possible to vote after many schol@@ ars before the proposal before the finals on a neutral place .
new from 2018 we are only compar@@ atively small details : so , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will in future will have the hosts in the first round of the host .
in order to reduce the costs of the organis@@ er , the requirements for training dates , etc . , and players will have to receive fewer official media dates before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers carrying out items into a plane , taking a survey
a survey under flight accounts revealed that over 20 percent deliber@@ ately or un@@ aware of items in the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration is passing damage , including at least 6 percent those arriving by air while they fet@@ ched kni@@ ves or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent alle@@ ged them , they could have discovered bel@@ ated that they were er@@ ron@@ eous with fire@@ arms , bul@@ lets or explo@@ si@@ ves .
the survey with more than 1,000 people - that was conducted by a jet @-@ charter service , the Str@@ atos Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also firmly held that younger travellers tend to consider the rules more .
of the respon@@ dents , the list@@ ings that they kno@@ w@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19,@@ 7 per cent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , members of the generation X were .
the most common items that were deliber@@ ately aimed at T@@ SA agents were conf@@ using foods and liqui@@ ds .
over 3 per cent gave to , kno@@ w@@ ingly items related to blades using the security checks , whereas 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 per cent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they were purpos@@ ely w@@ ned drugs into the plane .
the company said it has question@@ ed travelers in the whole country to find out how many def@@ ective sm@@ ug@@ gling was brought from the airport security and how many it would have done .
there is no surprise that people who suffer most sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers - wis@@ ely or un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly - through the safety carrying ones who were most often flying .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a little complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often un@@ certain what liqui@@ ds may take them or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the greatest amount of the T@@ SA conf@@ isc@@ ated items have been forbidden .
one time long thought people , T@@ SA could look at books as sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers .
liqui@@ ds are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ Customer order
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elektro @-@ thous@@ end@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k is available with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , he has so far signed that a part of the customer has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation already once again .
in addition to the continually tri@@ umph@@ ant figures increase and lower sales aim , Tes@@ la @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has made for the first time a different , less gl@@ oss number found : the cancellation made at the new mass market Model 3 .
in the past few months Mus@@ k has applied frequently with the more than 500@@ ,000 reservations for the new car , whose delivery just begins .
now ranges Mus@@ k a : of the total 5@@ 18,@@ 000 pre @-@ orders have been with@@ drawn 6@@ 3.000 already once again .
critics were always pointed out that it is only a non @-@ binding reservations .
in a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 U.S. dollar and in the UK 1000 Po@@ und ) &quot; reservation rep@@ ay@@ ment &quot; completely back .
currently , 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations before , sp@@ illed Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts .
that the cancellation of so far has about twelve percent of all orders to be solved , however the Tes@@ la Chef does not believe .
his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth goals is not in demand , but on the production side .
in the last year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 vehicles delivered .
2018 , you are supposed to be - all models brought together - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 a million .
the demand for this is evident .
according to Mus@@ k we are currently coming as a day of 1800 reservations .
who ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; must count on the second half of the year 2018 - when Tes@@ la it creates to drive its brand @-@ new , never in the practice of tested production lines without greater inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum discharge .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , it will happen to larger delays , then the dis@@ mandatory of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot cont@@ ented the satisfied customers in dro@@ aries .

a day after having been ver@@ ted by 15 states , Scott Pru@@ itt , the head of the Environment Agency , his former decision came back to reduce the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of sm@@ og @-@ causing bub@@ bly substances .
Pru@@ itt presented the change as its agency proves to be the needs of state environment authorities to react more quickly than previous Administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit which was raised against his previous position in a ministry .
it is a deadline , which ran out on 1 October for states to adhere to the standards of 2015 for the bot@@ tom@@ less o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pru@@ itt stated in June , that he will delay the compliance with a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to hin@@ der in local decisions or to hin@@ der the economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Public Prosec@@ ut@@ or of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma was a reliable partner of severe environmental regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , Pru@@ itt repeatedly tried to block regulations , or delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden conversion of Wednesday is the latest legal envel@@ ope for the Pru@@ dential Roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Appe@@ al Court in Washington decided that the EPA has exceeded his authority than he tried to re @-@ delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas @-@ companies for monitoring and reducing meth@@ ane .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one of the on @-@ week statement , Pru@@ itt , Pru@@ itt , suggested that his turn@@ around at O@@ zon@@ ate was quite simply the willingness of EPA to work with the States through the complex process of timely release of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous Administr@@ ations , EPA has often kept the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then awaiting the appointment for execution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pru@@ itt , which accused the EPA more than a dozen time in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines serious . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us very seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the EPA approved the opinion of EPA that pru@@ dent will eventually use its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to the delay and all the other legally available &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions will be based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ can in Congress pose on a more comprehensive rest@@ or@@ tion of o@@ zone rules .
a bill introduced last month &apos;s conc@@ ept@@ ance to implement the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet put to vote in the Senate .
by the New Yorker , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of the States , who reported the EPA in that week , said the group intended to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our accus@@ ations - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6,@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by sm@@ og , which comes into their communities , &quot; said C@@ utting man .

&quot; it is wor@@ rying how much pressure it takes to preserve this reasonable steps from those responsible for the protection of air , which we inhal@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ide@@ ological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to engage in environmental pollution and their specific interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celeb@@ rates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Berg@@ kirche is invited to the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ lingen am Sunday , 16 July , at 4.30 pm to a Seren@@ ade .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , a favorite place to stay .
the visitors of the Six@@ th Bene@@ dic@@ ine Seren@@ ade can be ench@@ ant by this powerful place .
the salvation and preservation of the oldest buildings in the village have made friends and sponsors to their concern .
Walter Martini stressed : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ d@@ ant jewel . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , St. Hil@@ ary@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was mentioned for the first time in the Wur@@ ttem@@ berg Ur@@ l@@ log@@ book : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold to Tum@@ lingen with the Vog@@ tei &quot; an Minister of Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and at his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wording of the certificate , according to the tum@@ bling mountain , apart from the former parish church also was a delightful courtyard , to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round .
so there were people there .
as seen from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still seen in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; of the Third , the glori@@ fied Sett@@ lements of the village .
old maps from the time around the year 1600 lined this historical condition .
the patron saint @-@ law came out of the early medieval owner &apos;s law .
a Lord , who built a church , built , and occupied with a pastor , continued to leave the pecu@@ liar of this church and was able to inher@@ it this pecu@@ li@@ arities .
associated with this , the right to use a pastor or to the bishop of a new parish priest .
three alt@@ ars were there in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Val@@ gar@@ dena of the two zer@@ os at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell was for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later during World War II in 1942 .
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window panels were introduced and the bells were stolen .
the roof was un@@ stable .
17@@ 96 stor@@ med French troops near the church .
they brown the pul@@ pit and ch@@ ises and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church thre@@ w 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as a last rest@@ ing @-@ place for the dead from hear@@ ers .
18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was allowed to stand .
in the New Year J@@ 34 , a storm built the church tower and the half rus@@ hed .
to prevent a mis@@ fortune , the tower was interrupted .
only today still existing Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ ets and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em by the &quot; Schaff@@ ner Rent@@ meister &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as an event , we invite friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , 16 July , the sixth Seren@@ ade on the Old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .

society wants to check approval of bicycles
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim wa@@ vered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see legal conditions for construction and therefore has turned towards the council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim awak@@ ens &quot; has called on the council of Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is un@@ law@@ ful .
the club argu@@ ed that at the time of approval was allowed on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer nav@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been allowed , as at the time in Vier@@ sen is only on the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal to exist a wind force concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , at the same time , the concentr@@ ations of concentration , but a exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the town .
der@@ lei zones should prevent a &quot; back@@ ground@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
the city Vier@@ sen had already decided few days before by changing the surface area a second wind @-@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but the District government had not approved Düsseldorf , because of a run @-@ error .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the lack of planning legal conditions , the author@@ ising appro@@ vals is still un@@ law@@ ful and therefore said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christopher Erk@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim wa@@ vered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the City Council decided once again in the summer break the wind @-@ centre zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a permission of the District government is still standing .
Erk@@ ens : &quot; with this , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the formation of wind turbines are legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the challenge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been given the circle of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vier@@ sen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it on the occasion to re@@ consider the matter again .
but they are unlikely to do that the procedure is stopped .
with a view to the proceedings at the Board of Directors , the Circle on Thursday did not want to w@@ ander in terms of reason@@ ing of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW Re , an subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area on the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 meters high wind cycles .
already last year the company had involved in which the town Vier@@ sen contributed to moderate agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares of great Gel@@ b .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households can be covered - this is equivalent to a five @-@ fifth of the flow of all quad@@ ru@@ ple households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sens entered the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch with Aachen , and a participation in a wind turbines in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor put together : woman dies at a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was fatal .
two more people were easily wo@@ unded .
the Landes@@ straße remained locked over a few hours .
after police information , a 17 @-@ year young woman came from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with their truck in the frame of accompanying drivers with their 53 @-@ year mother as a companion , the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and dealer plan &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ er and people from the region are supposed to re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city center in September .
the commercial club and the municipal authorities want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to get the local residents for shopping m@@ ool into the city center .
as the chairman of the profession , Christian König , announced the &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; show the customers to sen@@ sit@@ ise the offers of their own city from the usual supermarket .
we planned a market with regional providers , similar to the market .
in addition , local companies should present themselves with their training schemes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city center for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ It@@ tern@@ ach@@ ts @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action is not only for inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als in radio , an internet video and printed bag , which refer to the set @-@ weekend , so Christian König .
municipal authorities and commercial club co@@ operating with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
in this way , the commercial club and the city went into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ tr@@ active city center . &quot;
this includes new offers like the first &quot; acti@@ v @-@ day &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ fest with f@@ law@@ ful Sunday , conversation with all the trad@@ es@@ men and bul@@ lets to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the costs of parking on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential should be re @-@ established again or again .
also include short guests and tourists .
but also many local people would have lost the city center when shopping from the view .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to in@@ vigor@@ ate the city center - up to land@@ lords , the establishments of the whole city and associations .
it walked to overcome the le@@ th@@ arg@@ ie through a network that has joined some , had said some King in the spring .
Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , leader of the I@@ HK Centers in Mühl@@ hausen shared that the national &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; event , for the first time , five Thür@@ inger towns take part .
in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za , this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ lei@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day shall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; encourage the appreciation of local trade and make its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Stre@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the att@@ ain@@ ment of the Chamber of Industry and many partners makes it clear that every citizen could also influence its commercial environment with his purchase .

Tr@@ ump set up after per@@ me@@ able trans@@ criptions by phone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the bound@@ ary wall
trans@@ cription by phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and CEO of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump in a telephone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to quit , openly to say that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the American president cho@@ oses him because he had den@@ oun@@ ced the wall publicly . so , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This could not tell you the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump entered its presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US , and sw@@ ath , Mexico for the project to pay .
trans@@ cription his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ h@@ ind has also been published and presented a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ h@@ an said that trade for the United States refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; ridicul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; m@@ ies &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the alarm would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on refugees from refugees to the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after having said Mr. Turn@@ around , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the most pleas@@ urable call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford @-@ Mass@@ ac@@ re : activ@@ ist leading rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was deplo@@ yed by a group of spect@@ ators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and r@@ umped on the Ford @-@ Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with hair@@ pin to block its way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle aged middle aged in a needle @-@ stri@@ pe one - took a long train at its cig@@ ar and looked after the wind@@ shield .
inside sho@@ cks the in@@ m@@ ates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; br@@ ül@@ ed the man .
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
Schre@@ ie tor@@ n the silence , when a young black man was scr@@ apped by the passenger .
fortunately this horri@@ ble scene that was played on July 22 is just a post @-@ order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; brus@@ hed almost all of them in the audience very real disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 he dates back to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to re@@ im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey , from the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was charged for the mor@@ de .
&quot; it truly is in@@ comprehensi@@ ble that in all these years no single person was arrested , even though we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps in organising the post @-@ position .
&quot; it is a dirt in a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year former congress of the State of Georgia and a life of civil rights .
for him it serves as a dramatic call for action and constitutes an annual memory of the Monroe community that a fault has never been corrected .
&quot; we want J@@ udi@@ cial investigation , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot;
a tri@@ b@@ ating Par@@ ser puts a du@@ vet over the bodies of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford Lyn@@ n on July 27 , 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files , which were received by the N@@ BC News were more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding county in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but none has ever been charged .
although the susp@@ ects have been on free foot since decades , citizens &apos; rights , that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch campaigns in the whole city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 he made a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice of the black citizens in Georgia , for the first time in the summer , to give her voice in the summer .
about at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI of the black far@@ my@@ ard Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle down - supp@@ os@@ edly for a woman .
Bro@@ oks said the rum@@ or of the city was that H@@ ester have slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby , which she carried , did not origin@@ ate from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white hostess , 600 Dollar to free Mal@@ com from the prison , so the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and their c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they removed from prison and closer to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounds the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison that the Mor@@ de prepared and arranged , &quot; closing a F@@ BI &apos;s report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a holistic between the state and local prosec@@ ution , which was not only involved in the murder , evidence of the identity of witnesses and witnesses the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks makes it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ mass@@ ac@@ re &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you vote , then you will pass that here . &quot;
over a decade , Cass@@ andra has been the annual opening of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is vivi@@ dly , po@@ ign@@ ant and explained in a sort of deep racism from which many believe he no longer exists in America .
it is hard to look , and yet harder to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ n , because we are confronted with the ugly person in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build any relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen or hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
samples for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day thr@@ ust nearly 30 actors - a dozen grain and the rest black - in a room and lou@@ der , as Gre@@ ene a well made overview of the piece started .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ co gli@@ eds for years , but he said the role will never become easier .
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it is very important to preserve this story at life because we would not want to return to those times . &quot;
on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , die Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the test@@ ers out@@ cry and pus@@ hes him , fu@@ ri@@ ous that he has slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; I said , n --- , ench@@ anted by my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona are inv@@ aded the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks out ( at least all the black actors ) in Gu@@ ardi@@ ans .
Gre@@ ene laughs , lau@@ gh .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asking Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , always temper@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just do not believe that white people back then &apos; n --- &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; funny one of the other black performers .
&quot; you just need to make the &quot; R. &apos; .
and just because the energy shi@@ fts in the room , a sense of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the un@@ eas@@ iness .
everybody is busy to get this properly , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , it says it shar@@ ply and with rep@@ tile .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repet@@ ition ends up to violent and quickly .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , with a grap@@ e @-@ dress d@@ ressed , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads che@@ e Holidays trau@@ ing pra@@ ises &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot;
your voice breaks every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spect@@ ators swe@@ at and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come only down the road .
they have all experienced eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as op@@ pres@@ sive moisture if Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until that point , the Mor@@ de has remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de occurred , the air feels so@@ st@@ ically .
if the final notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites you to get closer to and inspec@@ ting the cor@@ k name .
children ho@@ cken on their heads , record the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other to each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ elt a little boy , as if it wants to remember it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene is thanks to the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ne we@@ dge away and we@@ ep their tears away .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who has played the cl@@ an .
Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aces two of his fellow @-@ players , and then cr@@ ying together into their arms , the emotional burden of performance breaks finally with him .
&quot; it &apos;s ok , &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you did this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience will put together with the actors for dinner together .
at a table there is a white pair of Atlanta pack@@ aged over the post @-@ performance with a black pair that she has just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ omas strug@@ gled to find words , which has left the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you themselves and that do what they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does it with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still continuing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called police officers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks &apos;s courtyard on his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of civil rights .
he said he had begun to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the post @-@ position is inspir@@ ational , because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have en@@ du@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; it is so , if we don &apos;t learn anything from it then it can happen .
who@@ ever has studied his own history , he does not know his own history is condemned to repe@@ ating it . &quot;

and I already worked in open daily life at school .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum , which I see here .
I have to do with different people , with juven@@ iles , with refugees , with young adults .
you are now 26 years , so late for professional volunteer volunteers .
how does that come ?

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have known for me that the Fal@@ se is for me and I want to do something else to work with people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then I wonder@@ ed what Are You saying .

Pear@@ son short@@ ened further 3,000 jobs and cut its dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will re @-@ build more 3,000 jobs and will cut its intermediate step by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will start to overcome the pressure that the company faces .
the job building , the General Vice @-@ General , John Fall@@ on announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 positions have already been lost .
Pear@@ son announced a plan of cost reductions in May at a third cost reduction program ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in order to re@@ vit@@ alise a business that was taken by the quick step to the digital learning .

Kon@@ vo@@ i @-@ Attack of Kab@@ ul : NATO @-@ Sol@@ dier killed in self @-@ ass@@ ass@@ ination
a su@@ icide attacks has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , a soldier of N@@ ato , and several other inju@@ red , say officials .
five soldiers and a interpre@@ ter have been inju@@ red , shared a declaration of N@@ ato .
un@@ confirmed local reports therefore died at the incident in the district Q@@ Arab ag@@ h also three civilians .
the bom@@ bing is the last violence that made Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a su@@ icide @-@ ass@@ ass@@ ed two people were killed in the vicinity of the Iraqi Embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in an opinion of the N@@ ato , it is stated to take the blast on Thursday morning , when a Joint Pat@@ rol@@ ille with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; of persons of &quot; impro@@ vised spra@@ w@@ t . &quot;
the statement states that all ship@@ ments are in a stable state and are treated at the U.S. military hospital in Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing force of the Taliban and the group that is known as a so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ h@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan , during the first half of 2017 , there was at least 1.6@@ 62 civil death @-@ offering in Afghanistan , about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July a su@@ icide @-@ bom@@ b had at least 30 people in a specially Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they would have done this attack .

EPA returns to delay the sm@@ og rule to cl@@ ut@@ ches
the U.S. Environment Agency has a decision to in@@ delay a regulation of the government of Obama , repe@@ aled that the states are committed to penet@@ rated the sm@@ og @-@ causing emissions . this happened a day after 15 states were accused of the accused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so called &quot; O@@ zon@@ Policy 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the commitment of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and considering that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA @-@ Chief Scott Pru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA in June to specify the O@@ zone specifications in which in a part of the country poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions must be defined , where in@@ cis@@ ions must be held to delay str@@ ingent air @-@ quality standards - in order to delay a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the Columbia area , held on Tuesday K@@ lage , saying that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to cut a wide range of environmental reports , which the former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a wider agenda , which is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , the efforts have spar@@ ked the decline of the Democrats and nature groups that are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health .
the Site of EPA is saying that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function and can get the symp@@ tom symptoms , &quot; such as as@@ thma .
community @-@ areas seeks Community room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ votes , the church decides of Flu@@ ph@@ orn b@@ link the establishment of a shared space in the future sen@@ iors .
prior to the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the remaining work@@ piece was signed , the mayor of Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades reported .
though it will still take , until the churches of the church have belonged still to the municipal property , but there is now no plans for that of a private investor to st@@ ating project more .
there is a discussion regarding a shared space .
one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , he would have a living space - some 55 square meters - and an ad@@ joining terrace with an almost 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the management and the majority of the municipal council did not den@@ ying such a common room not as the meeting point for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ o@@ equ@@ itable living room , but openly in the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision made by providing funds for the current household have already been decided last autumn , through convey@@ or possibilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is in the re@@ building area .
setting up a joint space would be reported to T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposed resolution envis@@ age to signal the investor to inform him in this respect no bil@@ let between the legs , the finding that both pan@@ ni@@ ers - which reduces the ambient temperatures - as well as for the construction of economic power - it &apos;s possible would be possible .
need@@ less , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this supplement .
when it helps : un@@ anim@@ ously does it happen to the panel .
it is not so easy when shared space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many own buildings where you are not moving so right now , for this moment you are now in common space out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Yvonne Sta@@ iger also speaks for the common room - but absolutely to a municipal participation .
it sees behind it a covered sub@@ stitution to any relevant or even foreign investors .
that is not so , because with the purchase of the area there is no grants , but I receive a genuine , in doubt , in doubt per@@ im@@ pose , is the ju@@ xt@@ apos@@ ition .
state &apos;s application , the proposed draft is appropri@@ ated accordingly , finds three advoc@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains in two elements with the original program that Stefan H@@ aller brings together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we summar@@ ise the decision , we make a step@@ ping forward to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

which was last not good . &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , however , believes in an increase in performance in the first official number of season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to be intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the Har@@ z of Star to Stern
in the Har@@ z the nation@@ wide first &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; is to arise .
this is planning the association Stern@@ ob@@ servatory San@@ kt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there are a planet in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the information of many Har@@ z@@ visitors was meant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he Stecker de Natur , Science , movement and sport@@ y performance .
the members want to get up charts along the planned route and inform them about stars and stars .
in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning to reach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gut &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in question , St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be added by the internet .
therefore , in the selection , a good mobile @-@ net reception plays an important role .
also , Acc@@ essi@@ bility is a crit@@ erion .
later the star @-@ trail can be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star @-@ trail , the viewer watches a lot of knowledge , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star ampli@@ fy them more than another , even though it is significantly more distant .
I also con@@ veys to which con@@ stellation can be a chosen star , and when it is best to see .
already since 2014 the association has been operating in the Berg@@ städ@@ ter St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which is the highest located ob@@ servatory of north Germany .
the portal site is in the heart of Har@@ z , according to the federal law for nature conservation on the six most common regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galaxy with a naked eye can be seen .
in the uni @-@ city since 2003 , there has been an initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen an simil@@ arity like the planned star @-@ wer@@ g - the Planet@@ en@@ weg .
starting from Geb@@ hard Hotel at the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Planet@@ en@@ weg ends with his st@@ akes up to the Hain@@ berg and the ob@@ servatory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Munici@@ p@@ ality ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the ri@@ mp@@ s with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to @-@ plan@@ ed de@@ gra@@ di@@ fied Plu@@ to at the end@@ point - are matched to two billion in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inking as a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ metres in diameter , whereas the exact 75 meters from the sun are at least 70 centi@@ meters .
the entire distance of the planet is just four kilometres .
while the light needs from sun to Plu@@ to about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour until the parallel with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are thus faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next f@@ using , but would last a half year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ cular Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , which should stand in a coll@@ ision event in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it to you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko is defending his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on the Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
as the couple for photos pos@@ ing , Lom@@ z@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as , that a possible show@@ down would be the &quot; perfect size &quot; between the fighters .
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I have asc@@ ending for Br@@ ill &#91; on 140 pounds &#93; but I am not so big .
I am small for 140 .
I want to run down at lightweight .
and he must move on weight weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
we demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko ad@@ dic@@ ed to .
&quot; box@@ ing needs this battle . &quot;
climate question@@ ing whether it should be in pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy , the Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year must be agreed in the next summer with Gar@@ cia a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) , who also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their lightweight cover @-@ fight in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans were asked about him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and op@@ ted later openly to fight for the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , he , Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he may possibly participate in his Saturday struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko was in a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the tri@@ athlon champion from River@@ side view &quot; very slowly from , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to start the co @-@ Aus . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show stroke , then box@@ ing .
both spoke them , they could feel the momentum , which he felt for their own battle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I have wa@@ ited for the top @-@ fighters and that is Mik@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four ports to tire plat@@ zer
on Thursday afternoon four people were badly inju@@ red on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost to 16,@@ 30 in just before connecting market width , probably after a tire plat@@ zer for control over his vehicle .
the truck t@@ apped to the right into the emb@@ ank@@ ment where he turned out and then stayed on the roof of the GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ ST@@ RI@@ B@@ N .
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were badly inju@@ red during the accident .
during the initial supply of the past through the ambul@@ ance service , the A7 was locked up north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be lead to the in@@ genu@@ ity .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &apos; Dre@@ aming chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann ho@@ unds after 2 : 2 on the season opening against Braunschweig , that brings the optimization of the formation @-@ formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first half of the season , Andre Hoffmann was happy , with the result also , there wouldn &apos;t be the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ites to much and we need to go even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defence of Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge Mountains , the Dre@@ w chain is also further optim@@ ised .
and a gate after an open boost , the continuation is also no longer available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that no more next to Michael ( R@@ ensing ) puts down on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with their experiences in preparation with the Dre@@ aming chain , than with the qu@@ ette .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach of Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we are just in the position@@ ings on the semi @-@ compositions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Cast@@ elmann , who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; the prerequisite is that we are even better harmon@@ ieren and we don &apos;t play so many play@@ mate . &quot;
of course , Hoffmann to Au@@ e also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one has decided to speak of a mis@@ sl@@ ated start , do not know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we can d@@ hang on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the Pok@@ al we will certainly be able to speak of a decent string season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of this , his coach did not want to know .
&quot; the start into the season , I spend only after six to eight days of game , &quot; said Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , who did not want to speak from an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken down @-@ pre@@ mat@@ urely due to a wet@@ ters .
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e may even be a little fres@@ her , because they would have no serious and complete game like Fortuna against a Ascension in the bones .
&quot; but they do not know so 100 % , where they are standing at present , &quot; says the inner def@@ enders of the Fortuna .
while guests from the Rhein@@ land go down as a little favorite on Sunday in the encounter in the last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we take them away , just because we have the claim to come under the first six , is Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ sinn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is absolutely positive at only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are no crew in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which one must take from the start , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas Chef coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a statement to meet would be arrogan@@ t and Hebrew . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in this way , Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday in no way .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ assessment tests published
recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden who were subj@@ ected to a new method for medical assessment of her age , indic@@ ating that over 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority of for@@ ensi@@ c medicine ( puzzles ) has started performing tests last year .
they are supposed to do more accurately during the asylum and the assessment of the age , after the Swedish mig@@ r@@ ational authority ( migration decre@@ ases ) because of errors when assessing the correct age of thousands of refugees have been critic@@ ised .
by now , Mig@@ r@@ ational runs has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test@@ ende cases and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid March until 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were considered 18 or older while in another 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency evaluated that the person has been 18 years or older .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person may &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are done only in cases where the age of the person is question@@ ed .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results have been established during the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person was judged as more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ ers has fallen over his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 44@@ 2 cases that &apos; suggest that the requested person was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det written the 5@@ 81 results published , she concluded that in 243 of these cases the person had frank@@ ly told that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , made in rays of knowledge @-@ rays and MR@@ T @-@ shots of knee @-@ joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ised in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the end@@ ocr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people to see whether they went earlier or later as usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biological age in this way can be assessed is very un@@ certain .
if we cannot say it for sure , we should not do it as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ sch@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is low .
the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are prog@@ ressing well .
a seven tonnes heavy on Wednesday was installed on the bridge at the eastern city of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going well , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Building Manager at the department of street and traffic in the governing council of Freiburg .
in April the works ended at the same time on all three possible bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
building is provided for October and is sure that the schedule is respected .
the first bridge , from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault bridge from concrete , which is bo@@ died with red bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 70 meters .
built it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure stability and road safety , the three components are now investigated thoroughly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , and 10.@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance to Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Mit@@ ter@@ och@@ tomorrow on the north side a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called Br@@ ück@@ sch@@ appe .
this is a bound@@ ing that is also used as an operating path .
on Friday the southern part of the bridge is to be inserted at least a 2,20 of feet of the board .
then the pedestrian path is to be gone .
the special thing is that it is about production @-@ parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the pat@@ ented bre@@ ds .
special f@@ inger@@ tips has the dist@@ ressing of conduc@@ tivity in the construction work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ containing which many firms are connected .
the n@@ atives were informed about the project in advance of work .
furthermore , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be distr@@ acted .
for the bridges between the building premises and the group@@ ing distance towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic is regulated by a traffic lights .
for construction on the bridge on the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village , the road is in the area of the bridge at the height of the Hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; completely locked .
the costs for the three bre@@ aches are together 700 000 Euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Prot@@ est bei deutsch@@ em Kartoff@@ el@@ al@@ at
it does not seem so often that parties go on a rope , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ for@@ a ) , along with what else is difficult to bring to a hat .
the representatives of the C@@ ret@@ arded volcano ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad coalition , which indicates that day at the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle R@@ ond@@ ell on the noisy poster &quot; large elec@@ toral campaign .
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land became the chief duo for the Bundestag &apos; election on 24 September , and the dep@@ uty president &apos;s dep@@ uty Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on @-@ site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to Af@@ for@@ s@@ men , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eif@@ el remains color@@ fully . &quot;
originally , the city p@@ its had planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain area , but will now take place at the parking lot below the ra@@ ining seat - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ ak event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the Forum A world and one of the author@@ itative organizers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people come together here . &quot;
there are music and plenty of food , including a &apos; of &apos; German potato salad , which could even eat the Af@@ ro@@ ds without any problems , &quot; says the woman who has brought him .
the police have be@@ amed many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence above all at the station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D have come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ ak Vol@@ can@@ ran@@ ate reports , he tried to make such an event every effort and the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had succeeded in Dau@@ n , but there was a failure , because of the already built Laur@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes not enough parking available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have so many nice events here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , chie@@ fly , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : at 8 pm on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse Red@@ ner , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land pf@@ alz @-@ president Uwe Junge .
in the hall about 200 list@@ ener , that are waiting for the nickname de@@ form@@ ations for the German Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the dep@@ uty president &apos;s dep@@ uty Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ k will hold its speeches .
unchanged is the police present but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
slightly more than an hour will take the Af@@ ak event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is a short while after 9 pm .
the police can dis@@ locate - no special inci@@ dents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
a feast with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is available in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ neu@@ zer@@ te tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm at the Kloster@@ kirche .
together with the bul@@ g@@ ish Tromp@@ eter Miros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea , &quot; on Schwar@@ zw@@ ald , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ ner &quot; hits a classic German training with roots in concert music .
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held Sol@@ op@@ os@@ itions in European tra@@ inees .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the prestigious Con@@ cert@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both united the desire to cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the borders of the different gen@@ res .
Johann Sebastian Bach this sounds like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; united with Bulgarian Folklore , and in the piece of &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of jazz gre@@ ts N@@ ils W@@ ogra@@ m , ming@@ le classical , jazz and free play to a fascinating art work .
this core part of the program was created just this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogra@@ m has written it independently for the two musicians and more still : the Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ kirche with their special acou@@ st@@ ics will be fully involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her Bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality
&quot; some people love fro@@ g cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart fully openly about her Bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I sat in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; .
the most well @-@ known relationship of the Palace - stars was that of her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert Patt@@ inson , which ultimately fell bitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all that as@@ sures the brun@@ ette of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in love for everyone I liked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you believe it , I would have played it ? &quot;
after her separation Kri@@ sten was too , that she is bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism .
so it has never become confused or hin@@ dered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I just liked it not to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially those suffered them according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in school times , when they preferred to dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me very seriously .
when I was eleven told me the kids , I would look like a bug .
I felt really attacked and scar@@ ed and ash@@ amed .
now , I look back and think of myself : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public they don &apos;t like to live their love life : &quot; people expect you to tune in a certain way and that anno@@ yed me .
and perhaps some call me to be und@@ an@@ gled , but I don &apos;t like to be justified before all the public . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed itself from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflection ... today I will tell you as the inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic govern@@ or . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in rejo@@ icing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Justice added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer I would say it is time to play a different game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump gave before a HU@@ GE announcement of the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice will not endor@@ se the democratic candidate in Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , which is according to For@@ bes &apos;s only milli@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he possesses coal mining in five countries and inher@@ ited from his father a carbon business .
it is worth approximately 1,@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can Committee held a statement on Thursday , in which it said : &quot; the Party of the Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party which would rather go out to work than to work towards our country . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with just 15 Gou@@ vern@@ ements and control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is the last rejection of a party which is from top down without leadership and unable to find a positive , worthy message &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ Chair R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ e lo@@ aves &quot; honest &quot; Russian resolution for d@@ oping @-@ sc@@ andal
the worldwide leader of Ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised in Thursday , which he described as an open @-@ alleg@@ ation from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it is not the moment for the country to resume in sports .
Russia Ath@@ le@@ tics , Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in told during the IAAF con@@ gresses on the eve of the athle@@ tics platform that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight d@@ oping .
he said , He said to him for &quot; all athletes , who were cut off with competitions and silver medals . &quot;
despite his comments , the IAAF congress for the maintenance of the prohib@@ itions , which was in@@ hib@@ ited in November 2015 , following a report by the World @-@ Anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( W@@ ada ) hin@@ ts in nation@@ ally funded d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was today a very open response , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IAAF @-@ President Co@@ e den Rep@@ or@@ tern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that Russian Federation has recognised for itself that it has experienced some very hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ e said he was also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia won the criteria for its re @-@ introduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the principle of principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ uty system , &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes are campa@@ ign@@ ing at the athle@@ tics world cup , which begin on Friday in London according to the strict conditions of IAAF criteria as neutral actors .
the leader of the IAAF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still meet some of the criteria for re@@ consideration .
Dro@@ w@@ testing are still inadequate and forbidden co@@ aches are still free , he said re@@ por@@ ters in London following a talk in the IAAF Council .
fun@@ er@@ act for in Mali isolated soldiers
at a grap@@ e @-@ party in the Nor@@ h@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar , some 1000 people of the two were thought at a helic@@ opter in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt at high safety arrangements .
to the still un@@ resolved enc@@ ir@@ ting , Secretary of Defence , Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
it recorded the two hu@@ gs names but as &quot; being able to present their expertise . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tend to sacrifice at this highest sacrifice which they have produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old staff from North@@ h@@ essen had come life on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
their coff@@ ees were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a dead @-@ guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom San@@ kt Peter .
in the afternoon , initially only the relatives of the church took leave .
then the fun@@ eral party began in the circle of family , eng@@ aging friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and the policy .
among them there was Hessen &apos;s prime minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general Chief of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
and of the grap@@ e saw ro@@ ses , the relatives were standing in arms in arms to the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defence of Defense from the Ley@@ en drew the Umb@@ rella soldiers to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and entered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ asser@@ mann used the business operation of the mar@@ ti@@ al tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilot of his reg@@ iment .
also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the reg@@ iment , to which the soldiers said , &quot; if this crew was not able to turn the crash , there would not have been dis@@ liked . &quot;
doubts about the UN @-@ Mission in Mali showed the Minister of Ley@@ en not : the use was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country where we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral service the coff@@ ees were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are as@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed , the Bundes@@ wehr made no data .
Prinz Hen@@ rik wants no grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prinz Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be ad@@ owed to his wife next to his wife .
these divided the spectac@@ les on Thursday with .
traditionally the Danish Royal H@@ aar is buried in the church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard mixed already a Sar@@ kop@@ ha@@ g for the two .
the Queen would agree with the decision of her man , it was on the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik am buried , be still un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to teach in his French homeland .
Prinz Hen@@ rik had never made a meal that he was not happy with his title .
after the th@@ rash of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked king .
in 2016 he went into retirement , and also places the title of &quot; Prinz@@ reg@@ ma@@ hl . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted , he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - also not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief place of the Danish kingdom .
where the last rest@@ ing of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old eventually will be , be still un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to teach in his French homeland but in Denmark .
he likes the land for which he has worked for over the last fifty years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French citizen , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked in the French emb@@ assy in the French emb@@ assy .
while his later , woman had always been listening to sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign .
in a auto@@ biography of Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I was doing was critic@@ ised .
my Danish was sul@@ ated , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk str@@ ings instead of stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the pal@@ ate , which I smok@@ ed instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and who had the reputation in this country the mark of a social @-@ critical intelli@@ gent@@ sia , I could not hope to hope .
I was different .
I seemed to be content with this position and not to be ash@@ amed .
these were the same two errors ! &quot;
Prime Minister W@@ eil will prompt re@@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP prior to possible majority in Nieder@@ sachsen
pre@@ mer@@ ry &apos;s prime minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green ruling majority for a fast re@@ election of the country , he wants but not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because speaking on Friday for the resolution of the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising re@@ sig@@ nation of a Gre@@ ens in Nieder@@ sachsen , the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) was over@@ thrown into a serious crisis .
five months before the official appointment of the day @-@ election the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover thus lost its b@@ ang A @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ westen established their step with the non @-@ nomin@@ ation for the election 2018 in its election circle in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she declared on Friday in Hannover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U @-@ presi@@ dents Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler aims to recommend her group to her .
with this way both CD@@ U and F@@ DP have sat down 69 seats in the Dutch parl@@ our , SPD and Green 68 seats .
up to now the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new land@@ lady is elected govern@@ or on 14 January of next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government now decide whether they could not go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
Stephan W@@ eil does however , however , is necessary to declare his self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its next action on Tuesday .
the govern@@ ment@@ arity also sees the possibility that the country tag is called the Prime Minister the trust and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be subject to legal clean &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will discuss all the questions in peace if they are legally justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called the west@@ ward step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something k@@ uri@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the politicians said : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it served as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the depart@@ ures for the return of their country @-@ days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; need@@ ing to say , of course , that she has received her country @-@ days , which she has received over the green state , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; shared the Landes@@ gruppe Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the presi@@ dents of the Gre@@ ens Anja P@@ iel said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have deliber@@ ately decided not to have a speech in the fac@@ tion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also against the background that there were no obj@@ ection@@ able differences , we cannot follow this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD ch@@ anc@@ ellor Martin Schulz condemned the survi@@ vor@@ s of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Green @-@ Members El@@ ke T@@ ent to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behavior of the former Green parliament@@ arians in Nieder@@ sachsen is not only advis@@ ing to voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal in red @-@ green , &quot; the Federal Office of Social Democrats wrote on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) , which is quickly newly elected to vote in the country .
the outlet of T@@ west@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
the politicians &quot; politicians &quot; in their deep@@ est van@@ ity and in their fru@@ stration their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ized SPD @-@ Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U seeks in Lower Saxony of this dirty in@@ ice and is trying to beat out of the political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ mon@@ place CD@@ U @-@ presi@@ dents Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its Members , El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U .
the Leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , thre@@ w t@@ ang before , with personalized career post@@ ers the outcome of the @-@ day election 2013 to be fal@@ si@@ fied .

agricultural ministers in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ ans , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discussed over contamin@@ ated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can the consumer be protected .
Minister for Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) in Interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , How can the consumer protect from eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer within and consumer , to view the eggs in your fridge and review the stamp .
on the consumer portal www.@@ Lebensmittel@@ war@@ di@@ .de , the federal states are presenting the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ charging stations .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if after all we know currently , health haz@@ ards is practically excluded .
does Al@@ di now accepts the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of awareness of the Federal Minister @-@ Minister did not truly perceived ?
the food surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
nevertheless , my house has arrived immediately and since the subject of disclosure of Germany is in close contact with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has the same as the makers to bear care that the sold @-@ sold products are safe and health @-@ safe .
if the maximum capacity of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is passed , they are not limited .
und@@ ated eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time are not the factories to blame .
sitting rooms and consumers in the same boat ?
after the cau@@ ti@@ ous knowledge , the production area meets no immediate blame .
rather , they must attri@@ bute them to mut@@ ually illegal practices of services companies with economic damage .
as always there is in case of di@@ arr@@ he@@ a to little control .
is it only missing on the staff or on the conclusi@@ ve jurisdiction ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was just the official controls that have revealed the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the truth also means that food fraud and criminal energy can never be eliminated to 100 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is precisely why a consequ@@ ent enlighten@@ ment of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can be , of decisive importance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have done so many times several times that I expect a l@@ able explanation by the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular Al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m of food sk@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to get safe and secure food exclusively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if an un@@ ber@@ ated insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de is used in the food industry , consumer and consumers are rightly treated .
approved resources are manufacturers , tra@@ ders and consumers in a situation which is absolutely not necessary .
basically must be clear : the un@@ law@@ ful employment of insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de fi@@ pron@@ ation is not acceptable in the attitude of food deliveries and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has to be consistently applied at all levels and worked with high pressure on all levels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I expect from all competent authorities , that the experts will be re@@ fine and tre@@ eless .
how the financial rules of the Football to N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European foot@@ ball@@ ers , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord will not distur@@ b the transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any conclusions will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , as the accompanying organization that has super@@ vised the European game has power , teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial and play @-@ play rules , which have been called by UEF@@ A in Life 2011 , mean that Sh@@ ame at some point has to prove that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without large losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a sal@@ ary that will amount tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mo@@ ve to France .
PSG can do with security the money to make N@@ ey@@ mar sub@@ ordin@@ ate and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the power of the wealthy family of Qatar .
being allowed to raise a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must deal with legitim@@ ize sources , which enable them to enable the Bre@@ ak E@@ ven point in their way to football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini according to his election for the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that moving in their quest for success has had enormous debt to themselves , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ky to ruin , if banks or owners re@@ tired their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P changed from concentration on the debt of the club on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model that originally used the novel Abr@@ amo@@ vich - a club with potential and then strong investment to build the team and build a global brand - become a tough@@ er issue .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P fail@@ ing period that runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini 2015 has fallen by the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor Aleks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly renew the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PSG pays the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a sensation , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year agreement , so that the solution for the next five years can be exp@@ elled from € 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 made the PSG along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PSG received a fin@@ ed of 60 million dollars ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later cut to 20 million euros later - and it was arranged that the teams are eligible for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 to 21 players won &apos;t be limited to normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is in search of clubs which could try to over@@ list their financial supervision by connecting their revenue by companies who are connected to the owners of a club .
while a Catal@@ an enterprise could sp@@ ire the PSG if the value of sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income .
it was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA was founded by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PSG Pay@@ ments to N@@ ey@@ mar over payments received from the Organ@@ iz@@ ations of the World Cup 2022 , in Qatar could be .
but PSG and Kat@@ ar 2022 have fought that N@@ ey@@ mar W@@ WC will be amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors and will be a such man@@ o@@ eu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
the sanctions against PSG means that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to keep in mind the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PSG on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as it was not authorized to discuss the PSG situation .
the last published reports show that LZ@@ 2015 / 16 achieved annual sales of 54@@ 2.4 million euros a profit of over 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year will have to be published .
PSG predicted that N@@ ey@@ ed &apos;s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing de@@ als , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot@@ ics .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best foot@@ ball@@ ers , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s fork , having asser@@ ted that PSG inj@@ ure the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financed d@@ oping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La Liga , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PSG . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ar@@ sen@@ al sen@@ al sen@@ al ar@@ sen@@ al , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that is financed by an association .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner , and this has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the past 15 years , &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial play , because you have different ways or have different interests , if a country has a great player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new scr@@ at@@ ant supplier
in the past years Cho@@ col@@ at Frey stove @-@ chocolate has produced for Swiss Life .
now , the co @-@ operation is in front of a possible end : the airline is writing new ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss @-@ Spre@@ cher@@ in Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ exter@@ t confirmed on request of the news Agency , as a corresponding report on the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Northern Western Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the Air@@ line in the first half of 2018 will close a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subj@@ ected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Frey we are very satisfied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Spre@@ cher@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some 17 million small rot@@ ten pack@@ aged blades for 14 grams spread per year the passengers in front of the landing to the passengers .
over the costs Swiss Life would not want to make any information .
in fact , this year &apos;s order value the contract volume according to &quot; north @-@ speaking Switzerland &quot; on 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the mig@@ ros subsidiary generates an annual turnover of about one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is always the adver@@ t effect : for a paras@@ ite manufacturer , it is a prestigious order .
how many applic@@ ants there are at the new tender , Swiss does not want to betra@@ y Swiss .
but it is only Swiss manufacturer .
according to the review , Cho@@ col@@ at Frey wants to strive for a renewal of the treaty beyond spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da was the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer not available for an opinion .
chocolate boards spread the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss a contract concluded with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry Cal@@ leb@@ aut had been delivered in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate bar .
the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss has conducted two and a half years with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Frey .

blow against drugs @-@ Maf@@ ia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
at Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ tomorrow were divided in the Black @-@ Forest @-@ B@@ aar @-@ Kreis , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart as well as the prosec@@ ution , as the prosec@@ ution , were divided into the Friday .
15 vacc@@ inations took place between the ages of 25 and 77 , and already issued on@@ ar@@ rest warran@@ t .
for addition , the officials created greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundreds of thousands of euros .
in the same swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German ar@@ rests .
the two will therefore probably be delivered to Germany .
on the action was involved Italian and Bay@@ erische Er@@ mitt@@ ler .
all in total were about 300 polic@@ emen in operation .
the members of the m@@ af@@ ia is organised crimin@@ crimin@@ ality , heavy non @-@ violence , ver@@ su@@ al murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and ext@@ or@@ tion .
even since summer 2016 the prosec@@ ut@@ or is const@@ ancy to the organised drugs work in Southern Germany .
between the prosec@@ ution in the Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a pure exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore , the large @-@ use of the Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ tomorrow was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the Vis@@ or of the Studies puts especially Italian nation@@ als with a close relation to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia .

the lead to some sever@@ ely dis@@ appearances in asylum procedures .
the representative for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Marx , in a media report pointed out to great g@@ aps in the country @-@ centric register .
defects in the registered registered data could lead to asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; to some serious obj@@ ections , &quot; the same way in an analysis that is located the &quot; southern German newspaper . &quot;
in the Register , according to 10 million people are recorded with foreign nation@@ ality , including approximately 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data will therefore be managed by approximately 600 aliens in Germany .
because data is not sufficiently well kept , the data quality in parts has not been good yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in cases , data made by 1921 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who have long since been no longer alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and actually should not emerge in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data collection can substantially slow down processes , &quot; it is to the report further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics about travelling round people , EU citizens are over @-@ citizens who would not need to travel at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such mist@@ re@@ membran@@ es led to a dist@@ orted debate on how to deal with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is therefore in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the Federal Government has obviously begun to re@@ claim@@ ing refugee families with a 16 @-@ year @-@ old children to Italy if they visited them from there .
I emerged from an internal paper of the federal state for migration and refugees ( BA@@ MF ) reports the &quot; Neue Osnab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung . &quot;
in the paper it means that BA@@ MF involves such procedures &quot; regarding families with children - except for inf@@ ants and to@@ dd@@ lers - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper with reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement is responsible for refugees of the EU state they first reach it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if an immig@@ rant is travelling to another EU country , this state can send him back to the country of travelling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the reason I now write : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the Record capacity for families with min@@ ors in Italy is significantly increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy paid for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ r@@ R ) keep these ple@@ dges for sufficient .
other EU countries would also send refugees to the agreement of the Dublin Agreement .
the ruling political spokes@@ woman in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ en@@ ke , critic@@ ized this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten due to the short@@ com@@ ings of the Italian asylum system , un@@ law@@ ful standing conditions and a haz@@ ard of cinema . &quot;
second result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living people provided the blood@@ shot already for other people .
at least by the twelve citizens who were honored on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the for@@ wards Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now divided into 50 lit@@ ers of blood with its now 100 donations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
traditionally , the community recogni@@ zes the majority in the meeting of the municipal council the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome , how our body is laid out for it and we respect the don@@ ors that are available to their blood for stran@@ gers , nor sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a single blood@@ stream helps several people , &quot; explan@@ atory the master@@ head of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ C ) , Holger Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher , because the cann@@ ab@@ ae are crus@@ hed into their components .
in this way , three people could benefit from a blood don@@ ate .
at the same time , Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher reported by the actions that are carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we made the second best result with 114 engra@@ vings the second best result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ C cycles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change into the the@@ atri@@ cian was charged a few years ago at higher candidates .

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0,25 %
the Bank of England is expected later to announce that interest rates are remaining unchanged after the weak economic growth and mit@@ igation of inflation climb@@ ed over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when they retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a strengthened print . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) with 6 to 2 therefore , to keep interest rates at 0,25 % , whereby the weak economic growth led the support for an increase in this month .
in its quar@@ terly review , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 percent and warned that pressure on the budget would continue , whereby inflation in autumn is likely to rise to almost 3 % .
but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years Zin@@ ser@@ ums would be necessary to bre@@ d the inflation led by Bre@@ xit and she said that the credit costs may need to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut @-@ Con@@ junk@@ tur@@ pak@@ ets which was issued before a year after Bre@@ xit .
it will be time for funding to provide funding for banks from the coming February cheaper for banks , although it is said that it is expected to place 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - at 115 billion pounds of Ster@@ ling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate said the Bank : &quot; in the central pre@@ diction of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) will be weak , as pressure on real@@ ms of households will continue to be stra@@ ined for consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the interest rates often repe@@ aled that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain amount of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required at the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a more greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale more than markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets are currently conducting the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that boo@@ sts were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grad@@ ual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the forec@@ ast@@ ed growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
she has retained its growth forecasts on 1.8 percent in 2018 .
the pound fell on these messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound was dropped by 0.5 % to accepting US dollars and dropped by 0,4 % to 1,@@ 99 euros .
the decision to no change will be made after the recent dis@@ appointing growth rates have risen to a fork hei@@ ght@@ less and GDP has risen in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to recover in the third quarter at 0.3 % , although it is easy to recover after the Bank at the end of the year .
the recent inflation forecast provides little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by an increasing inflation and low @-@ level refu@@ elling , since the ti@@ ghtening first becomes even worse before it gets better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy in the next few years can &apos;t &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also reinforced by increasing demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak pounds , resulting in a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision is given a year after lo@@ wering interest rates at 0.25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote which caused the sin@@ king of the P@@ act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
in front of the final decision of the Bank to the interest rates , the reputation for a fork hei@@ ght@@ ens was increased , as the inflation climb@@ ed up to hard households , whereby three political decision makers in July caused an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation has declined from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % during the last month , although the Bank said that this was expected and will continue over the coming months .
the Bank said that the crossing in relation to its objective of 2 % is &quot; completely &quot; the weak pounds .
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Co@@ reco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent rep@@ airing of the sw@@ ap rings , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , as the len@@ ders want to seek to end businesses and want to end the year in a positive way .
the market particularly looks good for those in which the existing De@@ als run and the new mort@@ gage de@@ mar@@ s , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to be contrac@@ ted with HIV @-@ Dro@@ ge 10,000 people
as a result of a trial before the High Court against financing the drug in the N@@ HS access to a &quot; transformed &quot; HIV infection treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that one before the sexual intercourse pre@@ ex@@ position proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) that may decrease the Inf@@ ek@@ Cho@@ ose of high risk factor by around 86 percent , now provided by health service to a first three year @-@ annual study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ al dism@@ issed in the last year a judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice , that the N@@ HS had the power to pay for pre@@ p despite the statement that the local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess magazine announced by N@@ HS England Chief of Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first one that will enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 .
prevention of prevention ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p is significantly reduced the HIV @-@ transmission in infection .
pre@@ p before intercourse means that just enough medication are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours prior to intercourse .
to those who come for treatment in question include pregnant or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , Trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
in hospitals , appropriate participants will be identified that the study will agree , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV @-@ status will not be monitored due to anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
individuals who are living in England and registered at a private hospital , can also opt @-@ in for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is signed in £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the supply of drugs this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study aims to assess the entire potential of pre@@ p by adding the clinical trial , as it is specifically designed and implemented in a large scale . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts towards prevention of HIV supplement and over@@ take .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a defining moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p when it is specifically focused on need@@ y and vulnerable people , the possibility to change the English HIV / epide@@ mic .
from September to people suffering from high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt to develop a new instrument that is really controlled and is not subject to a treat@@ ise with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now must be that the study is quickly carried out in the whole country and that no one who has a risk to HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , since the pre@@ p testing was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ Ministry of Health , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p @-@ process is welcome after a monthly delays and hes@@ it@@ less implementation by the government welcome and pr@@ one .
the evidence show how transform@@ ative this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention , and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt will bring us one step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .

Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , led by a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and sold out .
&quot; before , I lived with my Ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I sear@@ ched for something that was compared to my price .
this flat was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and had the same high ceil@@ ings .
I have fallen in love and made an offer on that day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot was completely out@@ dated .
originally a one @-@ ro@@ bed estate with a ru@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage room and a mezzanine to make the generous ceiling height optimal .
&quot; I wanted high ceil@@ ings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
to this end she commissioned the architectural and Design@@ studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceil@@ ings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms exposed to each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine to stand in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think creative , in order to solve the issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel plant is rather complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the spaces so they were over@@ flowing with no one we had to pick up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform but to create the steel so that he had the correct height for the function above or down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement allowed the fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine looks a classic cl@@ assy window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us via the gl@@ am@@ or@@ ous living area .
se@@ pi@@ eg@@ ed Gold@@ fisch , Silber@@ ne acc@@ ents and vintage Serge Mou@@ ille lighting set out the style for the program .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends , a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to let him seem longer .
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance offer mir@@ ro@@ red units place for all seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ am@@ or@@ ned space the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen if it is not used .
inter@@ fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
what is special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the reinforced , fur@@ ni@@ fied MD@@ F door .
&quot; it is mutual , so when you move the door very easily , very easily . &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the basics - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Re@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a property mak@@ ler will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials to provide the room to its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional connection in a home , &quot; says Re@@ fan .
&quot; you do not forget to enter into the electric plu@@ gs in walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can turn into something very astonishing by good design and increased square footage of something .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave them .
brothers fight because of an 500 million U.S. dollar @-@ imperialist
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the nasty in a confrontation because of one of the greatest real estate of the Victori@@ an Victori@@ an worth more than 500 million dollars .
the former Director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul removed . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and its assets are being divided .
Paul has wanted to withdraw itself from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp shift over the separation will take place in the Supreme Court of Justice .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers under@@ score 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family has since 1973 a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
West@@ co Je@@ ans family founded the family in West@@ co Je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail shops .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now comprises offices in the city centre , the development area of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with their dead father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; were described in the Family De Lut@@ is , about two thirds of the company &apos;s power , and Paul about one third .
a court states that this means that Col@@ in properties is worth $ 35,@@ million dollars and Paul is worth 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those proposed by Col@@ in proposed resolutions with what I held for the best objects in 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday last Friday , he took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice .
the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - which Col@@ in , like Paul claims to be excluded .
Col@@ in arg@@ ert , this is not true , but it thro@@ ws Paul before , some poss@@ essions are in@@ competent .
in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hope to commit the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian inheritance writes , that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases in the event , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides of the law firms .
Ms. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi , Italian immigrants who bought the milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950 &apos;s years and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they took the safety to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood ball , in the Col@@ in the first je@@ ans , the family opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co , when he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my last years of High School , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass her property to her sons .
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers in court , &quot; wrote them .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no more part of De Lut@@ is group , where Col@@ in asser@@ ted that Mark was paid $ 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said about the conditions of her financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has kept very back , although he was a former AF@@ L certificate and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lut@@ is and their attor@@ neys .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I really can not say much , &quot; because the case before the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and move our sur@@ name from the dishes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tries to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father would not have arous@@ ed that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday , this hope appeared to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be resolved in the near future by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
festiv@@ ities of new Stab@@ ili@@ ef is planning to black@@ ish the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if yes , he will be the first .
Polit@@ ico reports that the new St@@ ef of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow on President Tr@@ ump - including reports of news media - in the hope to keep the chef on a more competitive course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the new staff St@@ ef of the White House , at his first working day with leading staff , he set up a major problem in President of Donald Tr@@ umps white House which he plans to consume : bad information coming into the hands of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or brief@@ ing - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cell@@ ars diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ump to t@@ ump their media di@@ ets .
President Tr@@ aces relationship with television ranges decades back - and now , where he is at the White House , his TV shows still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Candi@@ date was up@@ set up , because of an unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he got a fair reporting of places that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign of Sam Nun@@ berg in February against Polit@@ ico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Polit@@ icos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to hold tr@@ umps &apos;s Twitter habit , according to six former election campaign officials is to make sure that his personal media sum provides a steady pra@@ ises . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ umps &apos;s Twitter would ever be &quot; under control &quot; is ridicul@@ ous .
maybe these combat st@@ agn@@ ants have something that we others do not know - that m@@ umps will not contain even more ign@@ on without their interventions .
we are probably never experienced a bit about the twe@@ ets that has not sent Tr@@ ump .
if his staff managed to keep it away from him some times , if their efforts were worth it , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently prevented it that Tr@@ ump @-@ pul@@ ses produces .
part of the problem is that people in a white house that bind themselves out from competing parties , always try to promote their own agenda by promoting Tr@@ ump material that may possibly promote their views from the world .
polit@@ ico - especially occupied with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ er , the president of strategic reasons question@@ able information .
this was an example , that was described by Rep@@ orter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react such as a volcano on negative press releases , especially those with sh@@ ame@@ ful le@@ aks , and that he can figure out how they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly this happened in late February , when someone signed a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the internet pro@@ voc@@ ate Charles C. Johnson , who used the dep@@ uty Stab@@ ef@@ in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; said the source behind a p@@ ile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson had banned from Twitter because of ch@@ ic@@ ans or that he has no concrete evidence or that he has expressed false alleg@@ ations in the past and re@@ voke them .
Tr@@ ump read the article and started to ask employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; gold makers added that the dam@@ aging staff of Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; have tried to implement a system to manage the pap@@ er@@ bar and document the Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did you work ?
Kelly tries to do three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still seek influence .
these un@@ altered factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
Mast@@ ering crimin@@ als get mail from Euro@@ pol

the police across Europe sent out to dangerous criminal cards on the flight in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
since the addresses of the requested sword @-@ crus@@ her natur@@ ales are not well known , references from the population was expected and pray .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follow the &quot; Most W@@ anted &quot; calendar for the winter .

since 2016 , it has been the website of www@@ .e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times it has been seen .

travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; milli@@ on@@ ary series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute passengers on the war@@ ri@@ ors who have negotiated one of the community bre@@ d dit@@ ch , to demand a field in front of their manor @-@ houses .
the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a well @-@ aff@@ lu@@ ent street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; milli@@ on@@ ary series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters , after they were challenged only in May , without being be@@ aten from one by the Council of excav@@ ated dit@@ ch , in order to prevent their accidents .
the tacti@@ cal group found a breach in the defense units and op@@ ted their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous habit@@ ants said : &quot; they were on the assembly evening after they were forwar@@ ded by Bentley He@@ ath where they have thrown stones on the pas@@ sers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced through shame on implementation , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the passengers were there in May , were moved further and are now back again .
more arrived yesterday evening , probably even today more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with by being long under@@ p@@ ings to protect their parks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ et@@ bro@@ ok Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my vul@@ gar@@ ment if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a local people who did not want to be called : &quot; it is ridicul@@ ous , we just have just seen the last round of this trav@@ eller just to be lo@@ oted by another round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have raised this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaker of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of a un@@ authorized bearing in the country beyond the Stre@@ ets bro@@ ok Road and work with the police of Soli@@ ding . we seize the necessary legal steps so they can proceed as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to support our approach , it is very important that many claims are to sign anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling on 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation where the court must check , when to submit our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the dam@@ al@@ ous ambi@@ ance company mbH , the 13th of April 2014 , approximately 30 000 nights per year was lost annually , and also recei@@ pts of the tourist tax .
in fall 2014 , in the light of dramatically rising figures of refugees who arrived in the rural district , the hotel buildings dedicated to the property office as a collection accommodation , provided for the contro@@ vers@@ y .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by establishing a development plan in order to secure the area as a hotel location .
at that time the decision was not cont@@ enti@@ ous at that time .
but especially Fre@@ den@@ stadt Ober@@ neu@@ meister Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious @-@ increasing interest in the house .
he should be right .
the group of Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with leader in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has acquired a voluntary association in Berlin and wants to get back to a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter facility .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Men@@ al@@ b .
you are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof had been standing under the entrance of the building , and when one enters the house , it becomes clear where extensive renovation works will be made .
the floors have been demol@@ ished , ceil@@ ings partly built , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is supposed to be renewed in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald@@ stil .
the rooms are fitted with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area will be re@@ designed , new windows are incorporated .
everything seems to be &quot; beautifully bourgeois &quot; as that Thomas Sch@@ erer expressed .
&quot; we want to make a piece of gem . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are among the facilities .
if one does not want to position themselves at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale city level , was emphas@@ ised .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms would greatly set up bro@@ adly .
both individual holiday makers , groups or busin@@ ess@@ men are to feel comfortable in the hotel .
conversation with OB Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism dire@@ ktor Michael Kr@@ ause he already managed , so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investments question@@ ed , Thomas Sch@@ erer will not specify precisely .
shortly under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
even the outside installations are placed on the front @-@ hand , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is open to the public , open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Mon@@ an : U.S. Special Tribunal for the Jury
in the Russia affair at US @-@ President Donald Tr@@ ump is designed to have implemented a so @-@ called &apos; Grand Jury for special funding Robert Mu@@ eller .
in recent weeks the Panel received work , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote on appeal to the cause of familiar persons .
the newspaper counts the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller adopted its investigation and intensified .
the CN@@ N Sender reported , there are already first ship@@ ments of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between the äl@@ ven son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence agencies acc@@ use the Krem@@ lin since long to engage in the presidential election in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller studied whether there was a break @-@ out of m@@ umps &apos;s campaign for election team and Moscow .
in the focus of investigations , several men should stand , who acted in election campaign as advis@@ er of the ub@@ lic@@ er .
according to that , Mu@@ eller took a lot more and more PO@@ s priv@@ ates and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonder@@ sublime Tr@@ ump gave himself into the center and the accus@@ ation , whether the president could hin@@ der the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to review and decide this evidence in possible fail@@ ures and to decide whether accus@@ ation shall be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called by dock .
mostly it will be swit@@ ched if the issue is bigger and contro@@ vers@@ y .
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be enabled by the public prosec@@ ut@@ or in order to re@@ charge individuals under o@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N channels have already been issued prior to the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and Russian lawyer .
those who were involved in the meeting were promp@@ ted to a statement called it in the report .
moreover , they should provide documents .
beside Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also has tr@@ umps consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed Kus@@ h@@ ner and his then election campaign for chef Paul Man@@ a@@ fort on the talk .
legal experts said on Thursday nights at the US television , that the determination is showing that Mu@@ eller let themselves mis@@ understood itself in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would not necessarily say that the Grand Jury will end in the end to decide on the gathering of an indic@@ t@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the inst@@ ant@@ ment of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums is at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new one of concern for president Tr@@ ump .
among the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday afternoon took a speech in West Virginia to represent the Russia affair as a campaign to promote his political opponents .
&quot; the Russia @-@ story is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the theme gives the Democrats an opportunity to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about what they can talk . &quot;
his special advis@@ ors T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in an opinion he is not kno@@ cked by the introduction of a Grand Jury .
but this also works usually in secret , acc@@ ented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House anticipated any measures that acceler@@ ated the work of the Special Forces on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI manager James Com@@ ey made three times said not to be determined with the president .
there is no reason to suppose that something changed in this statement , it was on the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had been introduced .
because of this u@@ aus@@ age we had been lou@@ pe against Tr@@ ump and he only wanted to h@@ amper the judiciary .
in June , Com@@ ey said in a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump has asked him for an adjustment of the investigation against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is at great pressure due to the examination .
on display of US media , the White House gathered material against the Sonder@@ investig@@ ator and his collabor@@ ators .
the disc@@ ern@@ most spec@@ ulation about whether to w@@ ool T@@ ump Mu@@ eller .
unlike in an independent special investigation of Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , the President Richard Ni@@ x@@ on , Mu@@ eller has pushed a position in which he theoretically could be tax@@ ed on the presi@@ dents of the President of the Just@@ State Department .
multiple Sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent@@ able such a step however .
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic Sen@@ ator exhibited there on Thursday that could no longer be dism@@ issed as easily .
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ eberg is driving in the Antarc@@ tic
in the West@@ ant@@ arc@@ tic , there has been a gigantic ic@@ eberg of the nar@@ row@@ ly size of Ber@@ lins , from Schel@@ del@@ s .
this divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institut for polar@@ isation and marine research on Wednesday .
the over a tr@@ illion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large KO@@ LO@@ SS t@@ ends now into the north and will probably take two , three years until he was mel@@ ted .
it is with 175 kilometers in length and a width of up to 50 kilometers by one of the largest polar world , which researchers in the past three decades have registered .
a danger for people does not go out of him .
what climate change has played a role in the dis@@ ruption of the ic@@ eberg , is un@@ clear after research .
in total , there have been a series of un@@ common inter@@ ruption of ice @-@ ranging in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact @-@ background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to the heating of the heating .
the KO@@ LO@@ SS now has been a part of Lar@@ sen &apos;s C Sh@@ ro@@ ff .
Schel@@ del@@ is swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it thus keeps growing further into the sea and regularly breaks off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ sol@@ en is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
north of this Schel@@ fe@@ at was the balance of growth and ab@@ rup@@ ting some years ago .
a complete te@@ amm@@ ation was dis@@ integrating there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is some talk that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ is in danger , as the front pul@@ ses have never pulled back as far as currently .
moreover , the ice @-@ plate among tension and can also be crus@@ hed if at a key point a piece of ab@@ ide .
the mel@@ ting of Schel@@ sol@@ en and Eis@@ berg does not hei@@ gh@@ ted sea level , since they swim in the water and put ice as much water as it gives after the mel@@ ting itself .
however , the loss of re@@ tire also leads to the gl@@ aci@@ ers directly into the sea and can flow much more quickly than before .
that could possibly enhance the sea level , but only in the low extent , writes the UK research project to observe the Antarc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ mish is according to A@@ WI @-@ Information with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth of Schel@@ del@@ is of the Antarc@@ tic .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , on the front @-@ edge to the free ocean around 200 meters .
there it regularly breaks off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is a natural happening , it is not a direct connection to climate change , the ic@@ eberg is now in a threatening position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confirmed he also . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists are controversial , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ s now grow again in the long run , and possibly inter@@ f@@ alle , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ y@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if this researchers did not fall back to climate change the inter@@ ruption of this gigantic ic@@ eberg , in the last decades , there were a lot of lu@@ pul@@ ling of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
this long gyp@@ sum of the Antarc@@ tic extends from South America .
according to data from the research program British Antarc@@ tic Sur@@ vey , the ice area of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 19@@ 50s .
to decline has contributed to the rise of temperature increase .

because it becomes more and more difficult to filling open positions , the CD@@ U to compete from the Emplo@@ yers Federation to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break the cra@@ yon was 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the administrative office in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now even 17 tra@@ inees have got their first working day behind him .
the form of teaching at the circle are obviously very popular .
some 620 applications were to be recorded for the places this year .
however , the circle is still lacking personnel in order to cope with the increasing requirements and tasks .
at the moment there is the circle M@@ ett@@ mann , still as 50 do not occupied jobs .
among other things , doctors and engineers are found as well as forces of the general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to now engage with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG in the C@@ k with the F@@ DP and the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
the administration is intended to work out according to the wish of parties &quot; to establish a concept for recruitment and recruitment development . &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term demand for professionals , but looking forward @-@ looking of the applic@@ ants , is called it .
the overall concept should be based on the inside and outside , indic@@ ating concrete measures for cross @-@ block@@ ers and include a training course , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
for the circle has got to do with Personal Problems that you didn &apos;t know earlier .
other cities present good officials and employees providing more attractive terms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a ver@@ right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it comes to a high number of employees , in@@ cis@@ ion or cop@@ ying due to service resulting from the service .
high time for action so not even more places un@@ occupied .
however , Klaus @-@ Dieter races , leader of the CD@@ U , with his party goes beyond the same request .
he had long been enth@@ r@@ alled already in the C@@ k for a f@@ ading surprise when he placed the public @-@ cost openly in question and the remaining parties were aston@@ ished .
nations wish that all options will be ver@@ ified that enable a outlet from the municipal Emplo@@ yers Federation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come here in short notice at a satisfactory solution , the rot@@ ate administration with the trade unions - maybe also in cooperation with the county @-@ nation@@ als , should seek a pet , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the CD@@ U , the CD@@ U , the employees and officials tries to pay better than the collective service is actually visible for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , boo@@ sts or more money are only when you changes in a higher level that is oriented towards professional years .
however , the tasks of the circle has grown more and more in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few weeks ago new premises had to be established in which the provisions of the new Pro@@ Constitu@@ ent Protection Act had to be established . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , land@@ board Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ dire@@ ktor Martin Richter a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy intensi@@ fies the tone to NGO @-@ migrants @-@ lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has compiled NGOs , the lif@@ eb@@ re@@ boats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they may not be allowed if they do not stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs are not sub@@ ordin@@ ate a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; said In@@ ner Marco Min@@ nit@@ i in an interview with the turbul@@ ent daily La STA@@ MP@@ A .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Min@@ it@@ is warning came one day after the Italian authorities had gre@@ ased a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; youth &apos; Save &apos; conf@@ isc@@ ated because their crew worked together with Men@@ enh@@ än@@ d@@ ders in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aid organisation , which has been in operation only since one year , he refused to express themselves with detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian State of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us and remains our highest priority to save human life . we are very sorry we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only test all alleg@@ ations that are currently being collected , only after we have collected all the information and the situation can be assessed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities have kept the boat of &apos; youth R@@ ettet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a since October .
it is assumed that its occupation is infl@@ atable power@@ boat on board which can be delivered directly to men &apos;s traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gler can be trac@@ ed so that ships can be used again .
at least one such an approach was found edly only 1,3 miles in front of the Libyan coast , according to the State of the Prosec@@ ut@@ or , the content of Italian media was published .
the occupation is suspected of pushing himself over the authority of the Italian coastal guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other mot@@ if@@ s .
under the code of conduct , boats are needed like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a above all have an Italian police officer , which super@@ vised their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to comply with the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Acti@@ va Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their bail@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Min@@ nit@@ i said meanwhile the number of migrants that came after the rescue operations in Italy , had declined shar@@ ply in recent weeks , what would be the efforts to strengthen the Libyan Sea and collabor@@ ated with the local citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Ch@@ ad , N@@ iger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants that these countries can leave in hope to reach Europe .
cradle and Tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berliner Out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz , for four days long tri@@ als and sightseeing .
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ enh@@ ei@@ mer Tal proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ un@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome bonus .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards for Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
there were views view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the Pf@@ al@@ zer forest and the previous planes .
in between there were over and over longer time , for the long pi@@ as reward .
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again , look@@ out at the look@@ out , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
at the last two days a lot of altitude were told .

console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga retro@@ fits for e @-@ sport
are the sport @-@ stars in future before computer con@@ soles , instead of struggling with wind and weather over the stadium ?
the fact is : e @-@ Sport has long been a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels .
these are also recognised by the first allies that increasingly engage in this field .
the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg was started in early July 2015 followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , the middle of July an E @-@ sports department established and two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire completely new young audi@@ ences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Chairman of the Romans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is certain that on such a train it is still possible to rise up . &quot;
at the upcoming weekend , the World Congress of FIFA in London is organizing the first &quot; Inter@@ active Club World Cup &quot; where the gam@@ ers compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , e.g. Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven was qualified .
also Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now an agency for virtual soccer players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football needs to deal with the 14 to 30 years old , that the young people in the future go into the stadium &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs sought to con@@ quer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian , .
with prominent E @-@ sport@@ s@@ men under contract , you could be much more often present on these markets than once a year send the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ ity to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
at E @-@ Sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Leg@@ ends , &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the football @-@ simulation of FIFA at the competition level .
long ago , as in the normal sport also , loved ones are established in which the pros compete against each other .
and at Asian , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many , the idea is certainly to be patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Ingo F@@ rob@@ ano has long been dealing with the question .
for Professor at the German Spor@@ tho@@ ch@@ schule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport , because it is competent and many biological and physical reactions , which one can also find in classic sport - for example higher heart frequencies , stress@@ ful changes , hormonal changes .
also there are cogn@@ itive abilities , a technical and tacti@@ cal understanding and a quick reaction capability .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the fit@@ ter Player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ atics also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ oping is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult in online play , and in the scene faul@@ ts the structures of the classic sport .
positive highlights the scientists highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of the e @-@ sport .
the players are internationally travelling , that is like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural shirts .
a survey of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ aktive Unter@@ haltungs@@ programme ( BI@@ U ) tells the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth .
in 2016 , it has been implemented 50 million euros in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ship and great tournaments .
in three years sales will be up to 130 million .
the fact that the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga are in charge of the Bundes@@ liga .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far away from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant .
international are many countries already on .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ bas@@ ket@@ ball@@ ers Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez on the US team N@@ RG Pro@@ ports participate .
Hollywood Ac@@ on@@ ess Ashton &apos;s co@@ w@@ l is investing in e@@ Sport cont@@ est@@ ing Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe is doing a lot .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport was introduced as lessons , says F@@ rob@@ ous .
in the Netherlands and in France the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Ver@@ a are now interested in setting up a E @-@ Sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Board of Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nost@@ algia to fall , and the old days to clarify , is now no longer sufficient .
it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but the company at the same time ex@@ trad@@ ed the modern market at the same time .
&quot; we live in a digit@@ ised world , &quot; says also Dut@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no one thing to keep in mind that only when football does anything like it ever was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , the Con@@ rad Roy to su@@ icide , condemned
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend through texts and calls to su@@ icide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years were exposed to currency .
Carter was sentenced in June because of the reliable killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ com@@ for@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal .
she was faced with a maximum of 20 years ago , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy worked on a mental illness .
in red p@@ ants and a cre@@ me@@ ad colored bl@@ ouse , Carter was with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down @-@ down eyes , when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ rad Roy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the prosec@@ ut@@ or to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they ended his life to make her own better .
she has no responsibility taken over , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter At@@ tor@@ ney said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they completely regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said however , he did not find that their &quot; age or ty@@ eg@@ rad or even their mental disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ ut@@ or read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day I d@@ ont feel the loss of my beloved my son .
I would like to be proud of me and how I am embr@@ ac@@ ing with everything . I try , despite all my pain we will carry for eternity with us , for his sisters there , &quot; is it in it .
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be prosec@@ uted by the realization &quot; will never be part of the wedding of her brother or be an a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; no longer this single person has been together with whom I stayed together since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep in mind for the rest of my life . &quot; she said .
the case seems to place a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit another , su@@ icide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was dead in 2014 from a carbon mon@@ oxid@@ ation in a vehicle .
the case attracted national attention to himself , after Car@@ ters dis@@ ks revealed that it encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; Hän@@ g dich , spr@@ ing@@ ed from a building , first you know yourself , I do not know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she was sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the ey@@ l@@ ain before his su@@ icide , she wrote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all you have to do is use the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter studies were sought by the death of Roy and ord@@ ained that through some press they will benefit from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few , the Carter def@@ endants , belonged Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , which was sentenced in 2007 due to murder of her British ro@@ omm@@ ate in Italy before being released two years ago .
Ms Kno@@ x , 30 years old , released in the Los Angeles Times Square : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ i : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ i was allowed at the Audi Cup as a captain , is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed Cup tournament awards a big season - Extra motivation is not shy .
something was different from his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ i immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide at the second day of Audi &apos;s C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made himself a cl@@ au@@ ght toward the arm .
&quot; the Trainer has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as part of Bavaria .
good , the entrance could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of co@@ aches I could interpret it in such a way .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was born in Youth , Deb@@ üt@@ ant and straight from holiday @-@ received professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f was chosen as a player leader , but he was .
sugar@@ be@@ et are still distributed to those who want to t@@ utr@@ age a lot of blood vessels which you want to maintain with La@@ une .
those who were ex@@ tri@@ b to join the heritage of Lah@@ m , a small extra motivation can only be well @-@ needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ imm@@ I confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player to assume responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ Lah@@ m via the field .
to the right rear , this is now his position , the white bin@@ ary on the arm opened its way .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ ich were in this starting formation like the one who can take the ru@@ der also into the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ coordinated force .
he had the view to the whole , while many others were busy with himself .
Vid@@ al thus to over@@ play his missing fitness ( folding ) ; Renato San@@ ches to establish the performance of Asia @-@ travel ( collap@@ sing also conditioned ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le to fall into their first performance in the Bayern Tri@@ k@@ ot not negative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sü@@ le ran alongside K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y in front of the resistance , both ag@@ gre@@ ed sovereig@@ n .
the well @-@ occupied Napoli @-@ storm often did heavy , and also the sweet@@ le also tried in the playing construction a few times .
his colleague Rud@@ y was ad@@ mitt@@ edly that the result was not that way we hop@@ ed to . &quot;
but he also showed at the debut , a decent performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Play@@ ing , Tem@@ po@@ Chang@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also being picked @-@ up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how un@@ paid this Bayern @-@ World is still for the in@@ accessible area , one saw afterwards to the game .
Rud@@ y zum example gave in cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ ich saw a couple of cris@@ p statements in the back of his new players .
there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting phrase : &quot; what is going down here , I have now noticed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Bavaria you just need to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , he must no longer bring the new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ care Minister : economy lo@@ aves W@@ iss@@ ings Tempo
it was often un@@ mistak@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as Evel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still an economic Minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is more than a year in which the new Economic Minister Volker W@@ iss@@ ing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and corporations from the region speak on T V request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time impeccable the old Minist@@ ries .
Frank N@@ atus , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; W@@ iss@@ ing attacks the wishes of the economy to have blocked Lem@@ ke all@@ es@@ amt . &quot;
the largest ch@@ re @-@ turn sees N@@ atus in the infrastructure policy : the L@@ ück@@ en@@ closure of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and A@@ den@@ au is at the bottom of the country &apos;s primary list .
again this year the Ministry hopes a plan@@ ing process for 2021 to 2021 should be law @-@ right .
a role in the plans in the country also plays the Western , in Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the federal government .
the aim is to take the route in December 2020 into operation , says Committee , by Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
N@@ atus faces an sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive businesses .
the Chamber of Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier , how of W@@ iss@@ ing encouraged to increase sales in the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to increase the market in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports since ten years .
in addition , W@@ iss@@ ing had an open ear for people who want to start up a company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Industry .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees in the new master @-@ bonus an additional incentive for young people , says Managing Director Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
planned for a prize of 1000 euros for the un@@ balanced and 2500 euros , if gradu@@ ates are self @-@ employed within ten years of the master@@ ship .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
with the planned street building , be quick facts to create , at the same time , there was missing the country at the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , captain leader of the I@@ HK Trier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 56 new engineers , who wants to adjust W@@ iss@@ ing in the state of state , until now , have only 29 points occupied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
CD@@ U Group Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the accounting , the country invest@@ s 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of inland water@@ ways .
Frank N@@ atus also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
furthermore , the previous Broad@@ band has also been broad@@ band in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had been rated the power supply assembly in an I@@ HK version only with the note of 3.4 .
they complain about growth @-@ end Internet connections and f@@ arri@@ es .

Audi should change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - automobile manufacturers face a bac@@ kl@@ ash .
one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW leader said , the company was the opinion that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as sched@@ ules , &quot; and there@@ for , there@@ with , there@@ with , European cities - including Munich where BMW is located - diesel vehicles or cab@@ inets .
Daimler was announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce his diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the entrepreneurs as call@@ back .
European car manufacturers have promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nit@@ rogen O@@ xi@@ des that em@@ itting the diesel engines , are considered as car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ s and can cause as@@ thma .
the costs for the car manufacturers , systems for the neutr@@ alization of the diesel fuel imports will also be installed , take advantage of what it makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also indic@@ ted to p@@ amper the powerful automobile companies and ignore signs of the problem .
the businesses trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called down@@ stream equipment , which regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules if a car was tested , but go back in normal travel conditions .
in the United States several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in the motor development of Audi were arrested in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected against delivery and could be put to trial in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German crimin@@ als after Volkswagen , after the authorities announced a system to manage emissions trading regulations in Europe and a request that concentrated on the United States has been extended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could make Volkswagen heavy stra@@ ining : the luxury car manufacturer is passing propor@@ tionally to the profit of Volkswagen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 1960s the breakthrough : with the release of his Car@@ to@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China I found Mor@@ dil@@ lo many fans .
again and again the artist of towns can be inspired .
large , ro@@ dish Mor@@ dil@@ lo figures stroll into drawings with the sli@@ ding Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he sits according to his own specifications , according to the drawing , which is presently working almost ten hours every day .
about calendar , puzzle , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , pl@@ ush animals and watches will still find lots of distribution throughout the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years he has been working on a drawing film and a TV series with its figures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main person in the movie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crazy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - that has a thous@@ and@@ s@@ ler as a counter@@ player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time , his figures speak to the 3D movie from 2019 to the chin @-@ wall .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ dil@@ lo .
the script is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he is rather focused on the TV series , which is produced as its original designs .
lav@@ ender from Provence is threatened with climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but it gives a warning that it is threatened with climate change .
the lav@@ ender is due to the lack of d@@ rought refres@@ hing conditions and because of the diseases transmitted insects , which are scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , large head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agr@@ arian institutes CRI@@ E@@ PP@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the past few years and in the autumn a lot more .
this has effects on the life span of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ad , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the Zwer@@ g@@ zi@@ c@@ ades over@@ carries , and in very dry weather there are very many of it . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
Lav@@ end@@ el@@ öl is not only suitable for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also highly sought after perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant drilling with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either lack or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with etheric oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered , include better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of the dar@@ ker out of the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dry .

the murder of a journalist emphasises the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the Wo@@ ol@@ enz@@ eit@@ ung Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet their plans for reporting about the youngest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through the organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drugs wars .
but this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about safety .
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what more safely alike : you should take their children with the office until 2009 were the goal of an attack with gran@@ ules , or make them home .
safety experts have written three words on a plate on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the re@@ porter , names for each column - no proof is needed , percep@@ tions and pan@@ cre@@ ed .
there are drugs , politicians , busin@@ ess@@ men , journalists who are suspic@@ ious at the secret of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no re@@ pri@@ eve of violence and while throughout the country , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to have taken up office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are faced with ass@@ aul@@ ts and threats under judicial protection and so far there was at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter , her editor and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs .
its lack will be felt deep , although its presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , which demonstrate its sm@@ ashed face with glasses or its typical Panam@@ era .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ por@@ ters discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although the law was established in 2010 in order to resolve the cases of journalists , this according to the committee has introduced the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings .
as with the most thousands of mur@@ ders , each year with drug @-@ trading and organised crime are incur@@ red , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely put to trial .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although it is un@@ com@@ for@@ ting and although the terrain is now even more preserved .
without information on the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting gave a little benefit to the discussion of security , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; says he .
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , we str@@ ust all . &quot;
in the morning of May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the capital &apos;s capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed just to drive a couple of blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ ol@@ la was raised by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , pres@@ um@@ ably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ v@@ th river . &quot;
the ar@@ cher ran away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans perpet@@ rators of last year and the ex@@ tradition in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the blu@@ dies@@ t batt@@ lefield in January , as ri@@ val fac@@ tions are struggling to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of deser@@ ved , two @-@ story mouse een for drugs that are larger than many houses for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; rest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trad@@ es in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , owing to the debt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
initially , in February the publication of a interviews with collective o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ ing party fr@@ actions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected of gang@@ sters sold every copy of the issue once they were delivered to newspaper files .
the second error was to force Val@@ dez not to force after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had released the same story to leave the country to its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his k@@ ill@@ ings are regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues would say that he would always be there .
he served as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he worked together with five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter on the d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time the newspaper earned a reputation because of cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and revenue and publicity .
re@@ porter loved to publish hard @-@ looking investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Award &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committ@@ ees to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drugs , wherever it was leading .
he gave up voluntarily to that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J distinction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug @-@ drug in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a lifestyle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must assume the task that list@@ ens to you as a journalist - either that or you play the Dum@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in view of so many dead ... why did you not say what was before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ aster , who was about a long@@ sho@@ re@@ man , the friend , the generous with hu@@ gs and rates , a teacher , who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his guard .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar across from the office and always sit at the same table .
well they ask : was his love for the routine his destruction ?
his death also has forced them to question their own assump@@ tions regarding how to get their job done best and stay alive .
&quot; you do not like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their cann@@ y start and run@@ ways , to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is even at the best times , a high level of self @-@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ keeping .
trust his own instin@@ cts .
if it smells wrong , stay away from it .
the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing with Javier has happened . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others say , are in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as they are in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home .
the landscape changes steadily .
in the room where the employees of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce came to security training , suddenly there were no phones allowed . days before has been announced that sp@@ y@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico .
Out@@ standing two police officers in front of the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were charged by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ sto@@ rey building in a mid @-@ class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the bai@@ z , some of the re@@ porter , if these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen , who are the Gover@@ nor himself as trusted .
it is months since the re@@ porter went to the Ber@@ gl@@ and@@ ry , where the drug players are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has concentrated on three main stories .
there were the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the Bru@@ ders of the former known box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the government spending , focused on the govern@@ or of the Govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that performed in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one block from the office of the state @-@ old , an ab@@ duction .
there was no official word about who has been kid@@ n@@ apped or how it happened , so when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter was seen from public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician , who ruled the ruling institution@@ ally revolution party ( Pr@@ i ) which ruled almost the entire century all political levels .
recently , several Pr@@ i @-@ govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ quality cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter , to write about previous inci@@ dents in this e@@ at@@ ery , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; gu@@ ardian must escape a military attack .
only a few months previously , the reader would have seen the Colom@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the kid@@ n@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had already knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slim body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was devoted to storage space for signs and stick@@ ers that protest against the Mor@@ de of journalists because the employees have become something they &apos;ve never expected : activists in the name of the press .
rep@@ ay@@ ear Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez turns a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the state &apos;s old .
Salvador Ad@@ ams disappeared three days , after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mic@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was detected and said officials , based on DNA testing , that it is his .
throughout the country journalists have become increasingly conf@@ using by having written down the &quot; SOS Press &quot; on side@@ ways and construction .
on that day the director Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez away in Washington and tries to raise international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez .
in a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the murder of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the Rwand@@ an authorities accused the government of sp@@ ying journalists and let them turn out because they said the truth .
she has always asked that she is re @-@ divided by the government because she is worried that her anger has inju@@ red her objecti@@ vity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico from organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were surrounded by government officials and a equal society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that re@@ porter was not only killed by drug players , but also on command of politicians and security gu@@ ards who are organised with organised crime under a ceiling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , you , because they want you keep the mouth hang@@ s , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the mor@@ de have a ab@@ omin@@ ous effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the Blog@@ ger@@ in Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern bound@@ ary of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found along with a note that was supp@@ os@@ edly signed by the Z@@ eta @-@ Kart@@ ell , &quot; Here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer sample and head@@ phones in addition to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close , such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern bound@@ ary of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Miros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue , as it did El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo , after the murder of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly announced the drug card with editorial guidance on the title page &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have escap@@ ed from their hom@@ etown or even from the country .
it is a pain@@ less decision .
it is hard to find work in exile and they still watch the roads and look for danger .
and sometimes she j@@ agt as evi@@ den@@ ced by the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , which was in 2015 together with four wives in an apartment in Mexico @-@ city three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who remain back and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bar@@ ra , who also wanted to be po@@ ets there is to say that the drug dealers might be scar@@ ed him .
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and therefore I became re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce began on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , than once all their phones began sum@@ med up .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band@@ efs and security gu@@ ards near the resort of Maz@@ at@@ lan had 19 confirmed demo@@ s .
the war continues on how it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the boarding @-@ on edge , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce via cell phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .

bu@@ o@@ ik@@ or@@ qu@@ ez thre@@ w a look at the gen@@ dar@@ mes that held w@@ ache to see if they were in willingness .
if they were afraid of fear they did not show it .
among the powerful portrait of the conceived founder of the newspaper , whose middle @-@ finger was visible for the whole sin@@ alo@@ a , followed by the employees of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce to his mark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you remember only remember , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when the same day he was ass@@ ass@@ inated , the intern@@ s of me asked me to send her to the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used Tar@@ as@@ eth to avoid his enemy
at first sight it looks like a statue , although a sc@@ ary .
now , researchers have found that the first evidence of the incredible rhin@@ oc@@ eros of a Canadian Berg@@ ers were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even find that his created skin was on a little bit - and they said they could have had something from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an in@@ peaceful past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report included in the magazine &quot; Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology &quot; describes it as &quot; the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ rs who ever was found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
the Fos@@ sil is a newly discovered kind of N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs , which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
its incredibly well preser@@ v@@ ated condition has researchers , which it describe it as &quot; truly remarkable &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mo@@ red plant vo@@ res is the best preserved Fos@@ sil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something that seemed on the surrounding rock at the place , and decided to look more accurately .
the Fos@@ sil discovered by him in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ ada Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,@@ 500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy stra@@ w@@ ling .
after all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be unveil@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are just a little flas@@ hed with the eyes , you could almost believe it has slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ ada Museum where the cre@@ ature is seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is reflected in the science story as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found out that this plant @-@ e@@ v@@ ore is covered , although it is covered with an arm@@ or and is probably under threat from meat .
the strongly ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a screening technology , which is known as a counter @-@ coating , which is also used by many modern animals .
this could have been allowed to mix better in his environment and avoid its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old cre@@ ature from the family of the N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs made the first time head@@ lines in May and is now shown at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ ada Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild beast and called the Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta defin@@ it@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ ker Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specim@@ en allowed us to hear Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the patterns and the form of shoes and arm@@ aments via his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ady , a widespread Defense method in the animal @-@ empire , which means that the tip of the cre@@ ature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ady is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exce@@ eds the animals living alive today .
it points out that the din@@ osau@@ rs was ha@@ unted by sufficient pressure due to meat @-@ handed din@@ osau@@ rs because the evolution that fav@@ oured the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that put the counter @-@ sh@@ aking - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or rubber , are much smaller and vulnerable as lo@@ ot , what sign@@ aled that this N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , strongly ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs clearly show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs @-@ rob@@ bers of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous must have been , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic connections in their sc@@ ales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was red@@ dened .
scientists still exam@@ ining the animal in references to his life , including his conservative Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to find out what it had eaten than its last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , driven into a river and driven to the sea , where he s@@ ank on the back to the se@@ ab@@ yss .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely much more displ@@ aced than they are today .
&quot; this N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ ated skin , but it remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the beast , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ace@@ time .
they do not need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is at sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k @-@ time was a time , when giant ther@@ op@@ oda , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r , that stood on two legs , the earth crossed .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus rex , million years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs was h@@ unted by some of his terrible ancestors .
this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tonnes heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose recent findings appear in the Fach@@ zeit@@ schrift Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was reconc@@ iled after death in the sea and has been ver@@ ified in mud .
the cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum , it is the most preserved din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle up to the hips .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long points , which rag@@ ed on his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the bre@@ d @-@ owned plant @-@ e@@ aters have been sh@@ elled from Western Canada to a flood@@ ed river into the open sea .
but the underwater ill@@ ation of the din@@ osau@@ rs was preserved its arm@@ aments in an exquisite detail .
the hidden rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specim@@ en are so well preserved that the skin is still b@@ ump@@ y bur@@ ns along the din@@ osau@@ rs .
like Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko on National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &quot; rare as a gain in the lot@@ tery .
the more I get it before , the conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied ass@@ ay of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank @-@ plates that carry the skull of the beast .
its right shape lies on his side , his five fingers are stretched upwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the sc@@ ales on his sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Thunder : mass@@ ac@@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age to A@@ 8 : many wo@@ unded
there was a big accident on Thursday on Thursday at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass@@ ac@@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age .
there are numerous Ver@@ last , kilomet@@ re stra@@ in@@ from - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ München ( A@@ 8 ) on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age about 20 people have been inju@@ red .
according to the first statements of the police were at 17.00 h between the connecting Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ circle of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm under 30 cars , including probably lor@@ ries , inter@@ connec@@ tive .
over the exact number of final runs , at first , no data is available .
it is a simple to moderate bre@@ aches , said a pol@@ ishing formula .
a great nur@@ turing on lif@@ eb@@ vehicles was at the in@@ genu@@ ity .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked in direction of Munich .

like a AZ re@@ porter , it came also on the return trip to massive disabilities - through numerous g@@ aff@@ er .
the fire@@ brig@@ ade not@@ ched itself the characteristics of the vehicle production , which now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 there was a second accident at A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .

check@@ out control .
but times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn test@@ et currently the initial check@@ box .
it simply confirms the phone to be taken and evaluate the ticket .
there is currently a test run on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does the offer come to expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will then be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the track used by the check@@ box without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to use this , however , some conditions must be met : one needs a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online Ticket - what already the most passengers already do .
you have to also bought it via the app of rail , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient type of ti@@ ck@@ book .
and last but not least , you need a space reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works so : you rise in the train , calling its tickets under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when testing a test , a button for electronic evaluation will be published .
the shut@@ ters get on their mobile devices a message that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X has been on the train and taken the se@@ eded seat Y .
comes the train companion in the check@@ box to square Y he knows that there is a passenger with already ent@@ ru@@ ed online ticket .
we can therefore sleep , continuing , keep quiet .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - which is to use the passenger .
&quot; who wants to be relaxed without a ticket control by our companion staff , checked out in the DB I just yourself .
this enables the passengers to arrange their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing @-@ board of DB correspondence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who often moves the train , knows that besides delays and missed out the check@@ boxes for the biggest nu@@ ances .
because often you have himself , in either case one of the fellow travellers do not collect all the records that you need to obtain the de@@ valu@@ ation of online tickets .
either the credit card or personnel reference , or otherwise a document that you have to proceed .
the consequence are endless discussions between train companion and driving g@@ ast , which leads to poor mood in the evenings or large @-@ room and delays in control of your own tickets and take the Schaff@@ ner at the end the time is taking care of others .
not only can a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that also applies to the compounds ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
scale numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Brit@@ t@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to its core .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis born in St. Louis in the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , who rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post by someone from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and still there is still on the road , called it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
b@@ aff@@ led , as no one else had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ some @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ per from the territory of St. Louis was in the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year old , who was killed by a white police in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed , live on live .
he indicated a picture of a brow@@ sing body that was dra@@ fted on the street and would stay there four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; thinking Fer@@ rell at its own .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she placed her cell phone to return later in the evening to twe@@ ets by people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people , the scre@@ ed , and by a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns father , who carried a sign with the ins@@ cription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
watching a live fe@@ ed , where a polic@@ eman had stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said that another polic@@ eman his gun and cr@@ ying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... for animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is not usual , &quot; Fer@@ rell reminded of their statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to and we can name it typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt sho@@ ok .
I was angry and cr@@ ying . &quot;
they booked a flight back and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cin@@ emas from the 11th century .
it is a history of survival and of the Protest@@ ant , of love and resi@@ li@@ ence , which consists of the vision of people living in the community and filled the streets to request answers .
as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who carried a flower gar@@ ment and a suitable crown , by F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , she bes@@ po@@ ets the two a conversation that she had countless occasions in front of this morning &quot; over the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do remember how black people have to fight for what will they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminded of what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police had killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take her , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have to know it and see it and get exposed in it .
it has to be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organization , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution , and what we need to do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which they personally experience no e@@ kl@@ ant racism then it is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling , I would prove her a bad service to keep it away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first stop when she arrived at F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that was assigned to an Camp@@ i@@ dic area than the activists on the possible non @-@ prosec@@ ution of the Dar@@ ren Wilson .
having Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared po@@ ckets before and hal@@ fing them to pass on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began a new kind of acti@@ vis@@ m for Fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Miss@@ our@@ i St. Louis President in the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food fairness and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience to organizing .
it has all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar just wanted to document ourselves , what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell in mind : &quot; do you want to document or tries to find a story that you can take advantage of ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ti@@ cism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of humans , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benef@@ itted from its pain and its resi@@ li@@ ency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as follows recently in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their votes , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field , who is known for his acti@@ vis@@ m around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt @-@ Over@@ land .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rell project near@@ er , along with six other locals , followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years following browsers .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are represented , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Fer@@ rell &apos;s experience - to show that the movement is &quot; not about a Messi@@ ah leader , but a community , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the open participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; consequently , documents from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rell &apos;s lives , how they fell in love and mar@@ ries her woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I felt as naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and for the de@@ human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rell &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of the black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which , after the k@@ ill@@ ings of the Black Teen@@ agers Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ mo@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media identify itself as a sul@@ try .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in executive positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly struggling on various fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , gay women must wear the main last of all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; folding d@@ ams , to remark that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really maintained of black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they insi@@ sts that &quot; this is no affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; during the he@@ rell , due to its identity as the heart of the film .
&quot; she was the person that sho@@ ok this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it &apos;s no coincidence , although it was at the front front because with a life in these cross@@ ings as a black one , gay woman is so much on the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the news cant@@ ors in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but racial connections between the municipality and the police will continue .
Fer@@ rell is on currency for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ ages of a highway on a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the soci@@ opolit@@ ical atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a m@@ ess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , she is voc@@ ally committed to a voc@@ al and she feels committed to this memory until three years ago she went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit @-@ gallery moves the people , even though it is not built long .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern part of the pedestrian prec@@ in@@ ct , since the first presentation 2009 , the population has turned into supporters and opponents .
cold leaves the subject hardly any one .
also on our Facebook @-@ page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; the topic is discussed .
while the one to say to the Bit Gallery : &quot; this would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; This would be genuine class ( Nicole Schau@@ est ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ occupy ) or quite simply : &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Scholz ) .
while the advoc@@ ates are building that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , of which the other businesses benefit , fear the enemies , that then attacked the pedestrian prec@@ in@@ ct .
add : the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall is in the 13 direct market market offering their products .
with the beginning of the construction work it will be finished .
the Galerie @-@ M@@ acher want to integrate a mark@@ eth@@ all in the new building - and ad@@ mitt@@ edly to Bed@@ a square with possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying nearly a week in the farm@@ hall for many years now .
mostly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ lady are always very happy .
also the but@@ cher have discovered us for us .
we would like that even during and above all following the construction of the gallery there is an opportunity to maintain this offer .
in other cities this is also true .
the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ensing , &quot; whether direct trading in a market hall in the gallery is moved , comes to the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it may not be too low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is shopping in bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find the superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is plenty of it in our city .
you can see how many cargo business here are empty , some for months and years .
but since there is not even a proper weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains at least .
because after all , the goods offered here is fresh , largely offered directly from the producer and is ob@@ serving .
as you can see , cargo stores are located in a shopping center only by larger companies , as the local people are often not viable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and what of it still is , will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping center with a mark@@ er fits for me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where is the farmers market hall towards the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - also in the duration when the bit @-@ gallery is actually coming .
or does it create the Ges@@ pen@@ st bits @-@ gallery before , to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
and a shopping centre , which is empty , also needs no one .
in my view , it would have been better to advance a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmers market hall , it is thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg is no more space .
when the farmers market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portra@@ its with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces see - white , black and brown that are almost in@@ compar@@ ably identical - hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portra@@ its were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ al of W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ cuts that were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison of Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence service analy@@ tic made a 35 @-@ year @-@ old prison sentence , after being classified as secret diplomatic reports on the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks publicly .
the new exhibit which was opened on August 2nd is called A Bec@@ oming res@@ emb@@ lance ( An appropriate simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ al , whose discipline must join her field of expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and landmark dis@@ agreement whose nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ al has been created by the algorithms analysis of DNA that could be extrac@@ ted by Mann@@ ing extracts and produced from the 30 portra@@ its of DNA , such as someone can be interpreted with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the in@@ dur@@ ent determin@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already talked openly about the identification as a woman , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 prosec@@ ution , including six off@@ ences against the sp@@ ion@@ ag@@ eg@@ es@@ etz , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison , her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only a single photo - a body @-@ big , black @-@ white self @-@ self , in which Mann@@ ing is visi@@ bly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ in@@ bl@@ onde per@@ ch carries - with which it was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ al came straight from the great success of their 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions . &quot;
this produced the artist portra@@ its of stran@@ gers from for@@ ensi@@ c Art@@ ef@@ acts like cigar@@ ette rubber and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um in bringing the DNA out of waste , to produce a picture of what these people might look like .
that was the time when they received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper press .
&quot; they did an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while being in prison , and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to join this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ al at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit at this time and she could not photograph@@ ed , so she took contact with Chelsea , and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her intimate M@@ use were joined to an un@@ equal pen@@ pal , which over two years have several letters inter@@ change@@ able .
they even created one by Sho@@ ot Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ erte Com@@ ic &quot; supp@@ ressed images , &quot; who would fores@@ ee a future in which the President sw@@ amp judgment and they would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days , after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release was published after seven brutal years of a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy coincidence .
there is also now in the opening of the exhibition a little deep and Star@@ ke , since Donald Tr@@ ump takes a war on in@@ forman@@ ts from the governmental camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ aked ways to de@@ fl@@ ing the rigi@@ d divisions , which he actually should fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ al was asked about the strange timing of all of these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a part of the gallery of the gallery represented by the artist &apos;s artistic statement , among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name is provided with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic de@@ frag@@ mentation , whose basis sex , race , sexuality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousands of cl@@ adding of C@@ s and Gs and As , written in graph@@ ite .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ al hop@@ ed , to demonstrate through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or Nu@@ er@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , how amazing , at least in biological ways , we are all .
&quot; what will hopefully bring about it is that our gen@@ ome takes no account of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ ua , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , also to be seen .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of those stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition is stored in a separate room is a page from above mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ No@@ vel@@ le .
it shows Mann@@ ing as it appears in the hands of the disciplines of the United States like King @-@ Kong .
&quot; if they address your speech , then they have won &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came straight from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the artist , who made from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get ge@@ seh@@ aut , when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was predicted in the coming @-@ book - but if they should do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ul@@ arity like hor@@ des of the Protest@@ ant sim@@ ulations .
that was also target @-@ focused like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing st@@ atur ) , when their genetic h@@ ap@@ ologies were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ al from the portra@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that stood up with Chelsea , like the movement , which is also behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and a Emplo@@ ye@@ e of University of Oxford because of killing
a flood@@ ed human @-@ hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , which was noted as susp@@ ects , after a man had gotten around in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly violations .
on Monday the Wyn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) ar@@ rests mainly because of their alle@@ ged participation in the death of Tr@@ un@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , like the recipient of the Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several Sti@@ cks died .
one of the police authority of Chicago , which was published by Chicago , that the bodies was discovered on 27 July .
officials gave a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injury to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead on the spot of action for dead , and Det@@ ektive examine the bull as a murder , while the police search for the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
La@@ them has been extraordinary professor for Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University for 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ ste , Vice President for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them was now abroad in the absence of absence , and being excluded from the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now an abstract matter that will be examined by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co @-@ operates in this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man of the university and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the U.S. government authorities in every concei@@ vable manner . &quot;
the statement also added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were sho@@ cked and want that he turned out .
Chief Communications Officer of the National Police of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said , he urge the susp@@ ect to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has a vision of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building car@@ et@@ aker of the Grand @-@ Plaza mansion , who had just received a mysterious tip that said in apartment 10@@ 08 something happened .
police described the scene as a very cru@@ el .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by safety sc@@ ans that La@@ them and War@@ ren in the building were .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim , and explo@@ res a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the W@@ ada &apos;s roadmap in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian vic@@ ep@@ ic Mut@@ ko
the Russian vic@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ ADA ) .
&quot; in a particular stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap R@@ US@@ ADA received the right to plan and test in collaboration with N@@ EN@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the W@@ ada Road@@ map was updated in this regard , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented the second part of the roadmap of W@@ ada to comply with the Code adopted by R@@ US@@ ADA and recently published on the organisation &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko it does not contain anything that could cause Russia to concern him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria listed in the list below shows that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities reported the reported results produced by the W@@ ada approved research by the Canadian At@@ tor@@ ney M. Mc@@ L@@ aren to alle@@ ged nation@@ ally funded D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sports .
regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation since our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has made a mistake .
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no state programs , and we will not admit that which does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping @-@ Commission .
in discussion with the Russian sales bure@@ au R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , sm@@ ir@@ nov came to problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organisations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report describes controversial positions and regulations .
nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; she added Sm@@ ir@@ nov .
R@@ US@@ ADA was excluded in November 2015 in the wake of d@@ oping @-@ Sk@@ and@@ als from the W@@ ada out of the performance of D@@ op@@ ing@@ kontrol@@ len in Russia .
however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the main qu@@ arti@@ fact of the organisation in Moscow in July the W@@ ada Director Olivier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ ADA turned into the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the Start @-@ ups , which will help your company to become the next b@@ ber
Amy Sig@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys do not work .
answers were often v@@ ague to be very helpful or - even worse - fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent .
and even if you said an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers know the process .
&quot; there were simply never consistency and objecti@@ vity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
it has got people from outside to help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the wax to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licens@@ ing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it allows companies to address surveys , special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lowers will allow the C @-@ suite managers to get and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools used by companies to compete employees .
salvation said that they have a better insight into what your employee think and feels in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t won .
in addition to the sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ map of the company that shows on a glance which units have most ail@@ ments and which ex@@ ecutives will have low cons@@ ents results - so you can ref@@ rain why .
companies come to view that at the head of the workplace culture need to remain so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale since then a former member has published a blog post , who describe an environment of har@@ as@@ sment , with those who have spoken to be pun@@ ished .
for start @-@ ups as well as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish for an overview is an lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance industry could be more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value in 2020 , after the finan@@ z@@ technical site let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ ters , the company helps to prevent the bad behavior and to realize , saw an asc@@ ending interest and activity beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber finds in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ piece has almost 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent companies tailor @-@ made &quot; puls@@ ation &quot; surveys , confidential answers in real time and view the warmth maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which the employee can report about this behavior .
and when the main business leader is included , complaints should go directly to the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board .
&quot; the condem@@ nation of public opinion has recorded the Reg@@ ulators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and Managing Director of Conver@@ cent .
when a company is found that his staff is treated badly or is un@@ ethical , it can be costly consequences by consumer @-@ boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , Conver@@ cent has been used for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their company .
earlier , if a cler@@ k wanted to report a problem , he or she had to locate a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to pursue the discomfort of employees .
now , as the company Conver@@ ters uses , problems that were previously reported and addressed in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ as@@ sment or ignor@@ ant pract@@ itioner are identified quicker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree from sight to experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management Group from Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from emplo@@ ying legal dispute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
company started to re@@ ap ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Quin@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor the ethics , people used hope as a strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ ters offer your software as a service , and loaded the company with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will support the approval of venture capital Invest@@ ors , which both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ ters received $ 10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sap@@ ph@@ ire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the whole capital was raised to $ 47 million .
celebr@@ ity secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and holding its entire funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , considering the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is an increasing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as si@@ lic@@ on Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only inser@@ ts .
the staff want to feel that you are accepting and este@@ emed and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that ranks their votes and that the work that you do is worth , then they feel more strongly committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Alex Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience on@@ Linked@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ ters and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors achieve return when their portfolio companies are well run . businesses are running well if employees are committed and engaged .
if the Analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and use of the employees , it &apos;s no wonder that you find support .
the data about the employee engagement after the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the ste@@ ward of a firm is not taking action .
indeed , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , this dis@@ appointments can grow and motiv@@ ate and employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen it very much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow associates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care for ?
and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now manages monthly staff surveys , was able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day when a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and following the collecting of feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organise the decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable of organizing several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company always gets new insights on the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond of workers in a industry which is known for high revenues .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose man , you also lose customer .
and if you lose customer , you will lose your company .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ days practices and makes it a long day for break @-@ up
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers are on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have moved their tri@@ angles and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these people represent a lunch break .
players who are en@@ forced to the summer courses are returning after the three @-@ hour exercise to their final examination , before returning to the next morning at 6 : 30 am to the Water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; this is for the boys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; said bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a before the Monday to Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and she has actually renewed their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 19 : 15 , in order to meet the already packed time plans of the players .
the compromise reached from the two days is more than a day when the break at the beginning of the Camp@@ s almost shi@@ fted a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing periods in western wood .
in the course of August 18 exercises to ab@@ rain . 20 before the start of formal slot preparations for their pre@@ l@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he sub@@ ordin@@ ate the control of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they were added to the busy itiner@@ aries of the players a further point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we place this enormous load three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it out , they plac@@ ements continue , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will finish their practices , as soon as the camp is finished , in view of the clear line @-@ line of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been covered with foot@@ ball@@ ers , which will be a protective network behind a tor@@ pole sit@@ ter that will be no easy task .
break @-@ players should occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a ad@@ mits that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; it &apos;s a real problem , and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people will rent a room and set it up there to find an exercise .
if you have the vide@@ ob@@ and of one exercise , it is a fairly good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces in parking 8 .
we will do the best by what we have .
so I am not too big concerned .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook aims to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false @-@ fe@@ ed@@ backs to fac@@ ades by third parties and then view their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in an opinion on its website , that it is beginning to begin with the use of updated machines and learning methods to send potential fal@@ mel@@ ting messages and to send them to factor aud@@ itor , which may display results of the fact check out of the original item .
Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main actors for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of whom believe that they also have the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French voters have been flood@@ ed in advance of the presidential elections in May with false stories , and Germany shall support a plan to be pun@@ ished after the social media networks , if they fail to remove them , as before the elections in September quickly .
on Thursday , Facebook in a separate statement in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of the new facts review .
&quot; besides the knowledge , which stories of fact @-@ aud@@ ul@@ ent third parties are challenged , people want more context to make well @-@ founded decisions about what they read and sharing , &quot; said Sara Su , product man@@ ag@@ ress for Facebook news in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; testing item &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and other changes to his messages Fe@@ ed in order to decrease wrong news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a Com@@ ic @-@ Romans : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a Squ@@ ee@@ ze music video and was a si@@ p for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ 1980 and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history located in the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent , now it has become an inspiration for a graphical novel of Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who is dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos;s sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that were illustrated in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &quot; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he expects emotional .
&quot; I only responded to the flip @-@ book on the side of a letter that was written by a double @-@ ag@@ enten in the 1700 @-@ er years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his flip @-@ print !
and letters are always sm@@ elled to smoke ; for at that time there was a fire of light because of the light .
for someone , the 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if he himself would be there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is be@@ aten to be assisted by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a lock ( &apos; To be honest : I didn &apos;t seem to be a little bit higher , it all seems too beautiful to be true .
Rhodes , his days spent his days to explore the Vietnamese &quot; new &quot; castle , to see the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ og@@ ging hy@@ ena heads at the walls and the bottles of centuries spent in the dit@@ ch .
he emig@@ rated by the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with land freight , gar@@ den@@ ters , and sometimes with the artists who worked at the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and started writing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received only 2006 the full access as the last one , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rhodes met a decade later , the staff started to take care of the archive that he referred as &quot; hundreds of years in which Arist@@ ocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Em@@ pi@@ res , cards , who said , &quot; you might think that country conf@@ esses would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to battle the two families .
guys , let it go through this gear ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive on a broader basis in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; that follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm up of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a mo@@ ver that appeared in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rhodes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the farm arose in this area and I thought an u@@ prising was a good beginning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe the two are connected to one another ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; which tells the history of Jes@@ uit@@ en@@ pat@@ ers that hid the family of Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Ther@@ rell was depic@@ ted from the 18th century , which he filled his own bu@@ rial , by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was first formed only years later than his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ l are Rhodes &apos;s family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite a cro@@ ok to always make debt and spend money on things they could not afford .
other generations of bow@@ ing men prov@@ oked their debt circles by married the rich old women - I introduce it to me as a bunch of hand@@ some guys with a talent to advertise overall . &quot;
after the end of his engagement in the castle Rhodes is searching for other unique read@@ ed experiences .
he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic @-@ novel about El@@ sh@@ re@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a s@@ atori@@ ums from the early 20th century , which has since then returned by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to go back with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf eng@@ ed
with the envel@@ ope of the 301 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ en@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef on Friday launched its campaign for the introduction of a new roof brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to be kept secret to Nelson Art@@ z logo and the slogan .
at the end of August it is the highlight of the campaign to be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the post@@ ers at the Rh@@ en@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we think that ( natural ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday un@@ locked web page .
&quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make it clear that man@@ ches is better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in essence , we strongly believe that we as a Bad Hon@@ no@@ fer citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attr@@ acti@@ veness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the action it is more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city an un@@ mistak@@ able person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , she will stand in competition with other municipalities .
a middle five @-@ dig@@ it amount can cost the city of Bad Honnef about its new roof @-@ mar@@ ches and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ gan afraid of the army
every year in early August at Ankara of the Upper Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on reti@@ ring and under@@ carriage in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance a regular process .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup .
the session did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but at the office of the prime minister .
the meeting under the presidency of the Heads of Government is now also the five vic@@ ep@@ ist@@ ers as well as the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
thus the civilians in Y@@ as were in the number of survi@@ vor@@ s .
the government is drawing up the re@@ ins in the military .
Vice @-@ President Hul@@ usi Ak@@ ar will remain in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y have been ab@@ duc@@ ted .
since the failed Cou@@ p has sco@@ red Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of inn@@ ate connections to the movement of Ex@@ ile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees the Erd@@ og@@ an as a re@@ wire of the coup .
against 4@@ 86 people who were directly involved in the coup attempt at the end of this week in Ankara .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coup d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an was &quot; referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he may give him the opportunity to clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erd@@ og@@ an have really handle the army ?
in the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ beh@@ agen &quot; in the military headquarters . &quot;
in the general Staff there &apos;s concerns over the increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which among other things manifest themselves in the abolition of the head@@ scar@@ f ban for soldiers , the newspaper wrote .
the large clean@@ ings in the army and the security gu@@ ards are on the case .
in the middle of July Erd@@ og@@ an per Dec@@ ree further 73@@ 95 citi@@ zenship , among them 23@@ 03 polic@@ emen and 54@@ 6 soldiers .
and it seemed that Erd@@ og@@ an was t@@ apped out of military .
the gener@@ als was formerly known as the actual men of the country .
three times , they called under appeal to their role as gu@@ ardian of the world@@ ly government .
after his election victory in 2002 Erd@@ og@@ an gained power in the power of the military action , last but not least on appeal to the reform efforts of the European Union .
former officials say Erd@@ og@@ an t@@ rei@@ be targeted a Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a well @-@ called officer , who was committed to the coup attempt out of fear of persecution in foreign countries , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meet that , such development could not let the N@@ ato not be cold .
in any case , there is a doubt in the alliance after the cleans@@ ing of the Turkish army .
the management structures and oper@@ ation@@ ate abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; says N@@ ato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
it will give a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , &quot; said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he envis@@ ages the legal immigrants to lower 5@@ 0,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules for the creation of vis@@ as for a temporary working permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the way the way citizens are spent from other countries of Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of chains and replace the current system .
this new job procedure will get the candidate who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media .
ministry wants to fly to the race @-@ shuttle
over the past few months the future of the race increases was disp@@ uted , and now it is said to go very quickly .
even before the end of the year it is said to be a short track , on which the tourist train moves , to be built .
in order to ensure the future of the race in the long term , according to the transportation from the Ministry of Transport , we are supposed to start on the circuit in this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and re@@ produce the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g further and re@@ tire , the country is familiar with this especially for tourism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; declared Mod@@ secret@@ ary Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for over@@ hau@@ ling the track rose to about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum the country took over 75 percent .
the treaty , based on whose basis the shuttle will also be ordered in the future from the country , I currently being coordinated , explained s@@ ant@@ l .
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen Railway as the operator have already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means the roadmap used for vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
thus it shall be ordered the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ shuttle is one of the most popular rail link between the stations &quot; Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in the past few months have been tested under a pilot company , whether the stretch out of sufficient number people is used to order to purchase them in the future .
the track is also heavily damaged in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
just as you thought it cannot be any crazy , there is a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robot .
yes , actually .
sex @-@ robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on developing sex robot in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Emer@@ itus Professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at She@@ ff@@ ield University and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start to take their rise seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of ni@@ pple and the type of surgeon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make themselves funny , but companies deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key on the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex lips have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robot@@ ic partners with a si@@ lic@@ on ret@@ ina that feels warm - with consciously human responses that can be achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can adapt its robots according to his con@@ vic@@ tions , &quot; and thus select everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot , about the shape of ni@@ p@@ ples up to the type or the color of his fingers .
but it will be even more distur@@ bing , as many robots had the &quot; personalities &quot; who would have a step@@ ped @-@ woman like progressive .
modern sex lips have evolved to robots with a si@@ lic@@ on skin .
the Real@@ b@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties which they find responsi@@ bly , as for example ren@@ ching .
and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robot with pre @-@ programm@@ ed figures such as Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ outing and &quot; Wild Wendy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ uro@@ us &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of the True Compan@@ ion .
so you like what you like and they don &apos;t like what you do not like , etc .
during the day , in the course of the day , they also have their m@@ oods - very much as real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it may be tired , fixed on conversation or she may be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many distur@@ bing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the most sub@@ mer@@ ing female properties , taking a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is called here : dis@@ rup@@ tive ) Far@@ rah zu@@ de@@ ma per@@ sever@@ ely a most .

&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a VI@@ BRA@@ TOR , why do men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is on the website .
however , these sex robots are not only a fet@@ ish or simply just another sex @-@ tool .
their formation and their increasing refin@@ ement point to something dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture towards a withdrawal of the ideal for gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as a optional addition .
most men will of course keep no sex robot , and whilst the FR@@ R have their rising popularity , they remain even preliminary on the ver@@ ge of consumption culture .
but what has se@@ ap@@ ed out of the edge @-@ zones , may be in terms of the spirit of time in which we live , be very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting , until they free the free market there is permission .
but there is a certain over@@ l@@ ending that these highly developed sex robot in a time arise in which the rights of women are threatened , where there is a president in the White House , who has fier@@ y women to have sexually attacked .
the most horri@@ ble aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the dev@@ oured body and the extinct eyes , but how realistic this vision operates .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their buil@@ ders want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , to the point when it comes to its &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not actual women .
you can not separate yourself from their companion or simply go away .
they have no placement or a background history , nothing that hin@@ ts on independence or anything that could dis@@ rupt the fantasy of total submission .
otherwise expressed , they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves .
or to express it in the or@@ atory of 2017 : maid
m@@ umps &apos;s large performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human rights
it has become a bin@@ ary of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions which pol@@ ari@@ zed the US @-@ constitu@@ ency , also families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and harvest feast , there were newspapers with Rat@@ ings about how to deal with the hor@@ ror of Tr@@ ump @-@ related relatives .
we are all supp@@ os@@ edly asked to put our filter bu@@ bb@@ les .
less noticed is the power of m@@ umps , families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ous@@ c@@ ous@@ ine , a ultra @-@ oriented poet who lives in Chicago and has long been dealing with rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in our family that this week has visited in New York .
she reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House everybody knows which she knows , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with which she fought for decades due to politics , suddenly and completely unique on the same side .
around the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in a further context that this will also bring significant risks to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left was reinforced by Tr@@ ump , but the continuing effect of his presidency has the power to move all to the right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that the kittens of one day will no longer be rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is , however , a terri@@ fying long @-@ time scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing , &quot; that suddenly appeared in comparison to its standards as a term of denial .
I find myself nowadays from an active nost@@ algia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s hil@@ arious version of the back@@ war@@ ring - the dog on the car rental , which saw 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew about his tax return ) - which occurs both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild off@@ ence .
when Tr@@ ump comes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only must be mentally health@@ ily , in order to qualify as imm@@ eas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the New York Park@@ ett &apos;s car department , and the best three dollars that can be found in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all the cl@@ owns are cooler and the animals twi@@ sts to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely fin@@ ster and the fresh@@ ness music con@@ veys this in a noticeable manner .
as many stereotyp@@ es of a city of dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of tall buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are becoming more familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
five and thirty years later , and I &apos;m still not quite reve@@ aling the day when I found that Swiss Cottage in fact no Swiss cottage is - the topic @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage not - but a large roundabout in the north of London .
however , Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange experience since here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ 17 years can be on it and all have a great time .
if I could have advised the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him full marks , but luckily no one has asked that afterwards .
on the other hand , I was comp@@ elled to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could under@@ go my credit card .
in the Coffee @-@ House at the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to get the rating with a 15 % drinking ti@@ pping - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ting pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation where no need is necessary .
the poor wife at the department store was ap@@ gra@@ vely gr@@ ating while I tired the experience to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with breast @-@ pain moved from prison to hospital
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital stay for the second time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year he was brought to hospital for treatment of cuts into the hospital he suffered from prison gu@@ ardi@@ ans after a fall in his cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was condemned because of a call for an appeal of prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first full practice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he k@@ issed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by giving them several times by a door of the Toil@@ ett@@ enk@@ ab@@ ine in his house in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a n@@ igh@@ tly intru@@ der who was hidden in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have proclaimed their intention , this time against the six @-@ year @-@ old sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say it is to indul@@ gent .
the national criminal prosec@@ ut@@ ors said that it would rise above at the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ection can be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is risk that its punishment is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a Bauer Arnold a strange egg
as the last of the cau@@ dal schools , the four @-@ t@@ äs@@ s@@ ler formed from F@@ oters and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen to the holidays and into the wid@@ ows schools were released .
three of the kid@@ nap@@ pers will in future go to the gramm@@ ar school , four on the school .
Schul@@ leit@@ ner Angel@@ ika S@@ itte , welcomed the parents and representative of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
as a symbol of the vote between the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schum@@ acher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des , a young Eagle , which is growing in the Ch@@ ick@@ erhof , but then release in freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the m@@ sau@@ e Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the chicken &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bauer Arnold was a strange egg , and left it for his h@@ ens .
instead of a chicken k@@ k , a small eagle came out .
but the hope to make out of it a chicken , sm@@ ote , the eagle spread up his wings on a high mountain and de@@ hum@@ ble .
then these classes showed three and four in the class@@ room of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance .
the ant@@ enn@@ as d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cy@@ lin@@ dri@@ es , to the bet .
the Eagle stands for the integration , said Schul@@ te Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young is different from the other young ones ( ch@@ icks ) , but belonged to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she wished in every quad@@ rup@@ ed eagle that he feels accepted in his new school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there followed Dan@@ kes@@ word to colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who always jumps on ped@@ ago@@ gic and the parents &quot; representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the kitchen period was now over , explained class teacher , Sophia Schum@@ acher .
they leave their pupils after two years of lessons only very odd , because it had been a really great time .
after all , they can rely on the quad@@ ru@@ d@@ els .
for completion , all students had a song by summer time and holiday season .
and with the children we broke great joy .
for the new school year already eight initial col@@ ens@@ ators are already registered .

software update for diesel cars : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
must diesel @-@ driver take part in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in a nut@@ shell :
at diesel , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group offers software updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars .
the aim is to improve the emissions of cars of em@@ ission classes Euro 5 and partially in Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anine vom ACE Auto Club Europa gibt ratings :
is the new action compul@@ sory ?
no , the managed software updates are voluntary .
&quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the cars , the Schum@@ mel@@ software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin .
their retro@@ fit has formally ordered the European office ( KBA ) .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months , but has not yet called for an exact date .
Daimler has notified to write every person concerned .
if any inspection is sus@@ cep@@ tible , that will be done in their frame .
how long do the equipment occur in total ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the coher@@ encies of the engagement of the manufacturers as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , volunte@@ ering to deal with the theme of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will this update take ?
the retro@@ fit itself could take place in the workshop only three to four hours .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
what do motor@@ ists do not driving a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW company ?
the ACE to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would re@@ draw , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is now a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE wa@@ ited this .
but even in the regions where driver are dro@@ w@@ ned .
in rural areas there are not so far added value for older diesel .
the ACE are standing , with a sale nor to be seen .

we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , continues in the coming year in R@@ ente .
the place already is already written - appropriate applic@@ ants are however r@@ ar .
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work is still doing great fun as he con@@ veys on the press coverage .
it reports of varied , but also challenging tasks that await his successor .
at the same time , he wonder@@ ed that so far no application met the requirement profile .
the city looks for the next time an architect or construction engineers .
thus , under consideration of the regular dism@@ iss@@ al free@@ zing - still enough time for a preparation .
da Has@@ lach for the administration as sub@@ ordin@@ ate building functions , the applic@@ ant must as@@ sign the corresponding degrees .
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
would they no longer be able to fill them , the citizen would have to drive to the consultation right up to Off@@ enburg .
but civil proximity was the city and himself important , says W@@ acker , who reported by a good operating atmosphere , as well as good mood among the authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office several major projects have accum@@ ulated , the w@@ acker can look back with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city of lively , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ arrangement of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and of the tie @-@ down parking lot are available .
the orthodo@@ x bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium is still subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will strike with around 1.5 million Euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we &apos;re doing it correctly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all future tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
gest@@ alt is present for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister of great scope .
with Haz@@ l@@ ach@@ s of its own building and gar@@ dener could be very flexible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so W@@ acker and the creation of the gre@@ ek @-@ plants will often be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Old Town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye to have what rein@@ forces &quot; when new buildings are approved , the divorce Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
anyway is the Stadt@@ bau@@ master high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything runs through my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count on many years of experience : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( High @-@ construction ) has been present for ten years , Manfred Sch@@ er ( deep @-@ building ) for 15 years .
also that his successor is going on for a long time , W@@ acker doesn &apos;t wish to desire , &quot; we &apos;re looking for someone who really would like to be identified and stay with the place . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good operating company , but also for the continued design of the city .
who Roland W@@ acker doesn &apos;t want to be advised of the city of Has@@ lach a closed study as a di@@ pl@@ ine engineer or bach@@ el@@ or with specialist architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction planning .
the municipal office is under@@ mining high @-@ building and low @-@ building , building structures , management of urban li@@ vest@@ ments , municipal establishments with Bau@@ hof and Stadt@@ g@@ ärt@@ ner@@ ei , as well as sub@@ ordin@@ ances , including monuments protection .
cycling on the lines : South @-@ circuit locked
according to police , the well @-@ known perpet@@ r@@ ator had thrown the blue bicycle from railway g@@ leis@@ urely in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Road ( B@@ 116 ) to the leader@@ ships .
these were so badly damaged , that the cleans@@ ing freight @-@ train had to be hal@@ ted .
the investig@@ ators go out from two male acts and look for the night hours after them .
close to the scene of witnesses a pink sco@@ oter and a bike driver had been observed .
&quot; this is far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ d @-@ stre@@ ich , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch to APA .
the perpet@@ rators , or the perpet@@ rators would have expressed itself in great danger and is also threatened by rail traffic .
in addition to the damage to the L@@ ok and the installation , as well as late @-@ delays and costs of rail transport , allow the passenger customers to get to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a total of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considerable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Spe@@ aker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages on Friday afternoon again fixed , the railway traffic on the south @-@ route could be conducted without a disability .
almost 10 persons left on Friday afternoon , two of them consider the correspondence .
freight trains fell out , but they had delay .
according to Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be swit@@ ched around 200 metres rou@@ ghts .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , milk products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( infl@@ amed bow@@ ing disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study argue exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could relie@@ ve the symptoms of patients with inflammat@@ ory intest@@ inal diseases .
the incur@@ able condition , affecting around 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300@@ ,000 , causes gast@@ ric cr@@ amps and bl@@ acks , recur@@ rent or bloody di@@ arr@@ ings , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are usually get married , meat and dairy products are usually out to relie@@ ve their symptoms , found researchers at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an of proteins contribute to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant Dar@@ m .
the leit@@ ner researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rolling to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , which hide in the food not penet@@ rate into the body .
cells , which are able to trigger inflammation , are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissue .
if the balance is too far toward inflammation , it may result in inflammat@@ ory Dar@@ ing disease .
in experiments proved that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting imm@@ unity is found in mice , which carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their inj@@ ectors .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an - one of the principal blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an the mice in its food had , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one to tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ ane nutrition has more toler@@ ated , less inflammat@@ ory intest@@ inal intest@@ ines , if the same system also acquire at people .
the Post@@ dok@@ tor@@ and@@ in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an under@@ went a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as it had figured out that a group of study ws had such cells , but another group of the same tribe but had been separated from that .
they susp@@ ect that the difference with the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ omen of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms which usually live in the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract .
the dam@@ me of mice became DNA sequ@@ ences , and there were six bacterial species available in the mice with the immune cells , but without them mist@@ aken with the mice .
mice were re@@ ared in an ster@@ il@@ ful environment so that they had l@@ acked a gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and did not get these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria op@@ ted on the immune system , the researcher L. reu@@ ter@@ i have to grow in fluid and over@@ carried small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on in@@ ri@@ pe immune cells , which were isolated by the mice .
the immune @-@ cells developed into the toler@@ ant @-@ producing cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied out of the liquid , it proved itself as a by @-@ product of tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an met@@ abolic disease that is known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 mil@@ an acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an in feed the mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an@@ values have been hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an stated that people have the same toler@@ ant con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve cells such as mice , and most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect us in our stomach @-@ intest@@ inal tract .
it is not known if tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an adren@@ al products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in people as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an were found among people with infl@@ amed intest@@ ine disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially , high tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ ane values can lead to a extension of this population &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on the rad@@ ar test , the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a stamina for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertisement first earlier .

a new Deep @-@ draft for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
as the wind is turning : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel still SPD @-@ boss , the social @-@ democratic Prime Minister before elections always talked with a certain concern to Berlin .
only no stor@@ y@@ fire from the Party central , merely no head@@ wind from the covenant - so loud the most important wish of the elec@@ toral struggle .
since Martin Schulz has led the Party , the fundamental change has changed .
since then , the people from the Willy @-@ Brandt , have been watching the events of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House with growing the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Mr Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year , with head@@ wind would not be described in the approach .
there were low @-@ attacks .
and one after another .
the Con@@ federation @-@ CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a gener@@ al@@ ous signal against co@@ al@@ itions of SPD and Green .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be firm , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber the editors network in Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fraction of a Green Party has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the presidential election , his red @-@ green coalition won their A @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ State manager Michael Kell@@ ner asked the Ab@@ tr@@ ün@@ n Dutch Bundestag @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ ent to return their mandate .
the Over@@ step of the CD@@ U means a clear dec@@ ay of choosing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ ent must immediately return their mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the federal executive leader and election leaders of the Gre@@ ens to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sigh@@ ted an SPD @-@ election campaign than on Friday morning the new Hi@@ obs@@ bot@@ t reaches the Party central . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil , SPD @-@ President of Nieder@@ sachsen , stands after the remains of the Green Members of El@@ ke T@@ ent to the CD@@ U without its own ruling majority .
it is the pro@@ visional climax of a whole series of big and small crises in the SPD &apos;s associations .
and nobody knows what next comes next .
the mis@@ ere began with the unexpected defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , so@@ othing the comrades of consciousness .
after the National@@ rats@@ wahlen in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen I will be anything other way .
that was then also - and it all became worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to diving , the Düsseldorf @-@ ple@@ ite dra@@ d the party straight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pain@@ stak@@ ingly , the comrades lined up in the weeks after that . &quot; &quot; &quot;

and with him the next deep@@ ening came .
Mayor O@@ la@@ f Scholz , the last strong SPD farm , lost his Nim@@ bus at that weekend because he sat in El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie during the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie .
and because he was doing so quite wrong in crisis communication , so that what you can do wrong .
since then , Scholz is fighting for its political survival .
so now also Stephan W@@ eil .
because of the VW @-@ emissions and its role in the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board , the Dutch prime minister had been standing in criticism since long ago .
Mi@@ ese eti@@ qu@@ ish came here .
nevertheless , or perhaps because of this , W@@ eil tried to put more and stronger in the covenant for the past few weeks .
the aim of the former mayor of the city of Hanover , his power in Berlin remained not hidden also in the context of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , because they agreed to a stabili@@ zation of the party in turn .
now the exact opposite could enter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thereby , W@@ eil meets the im@@ partial internal compul@@ sion of the Sax@@ on Green Party in general no fault . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Schulz certainly not .
sometimes the com@@ ers try to hold their own ranks shut down .
their wrath is directed to the Gre@@ ens , and here especially for the most comp@@ lice of parliament@@ arians in the west .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democr@@ acies , such as Mrs. T@@ ent their own career paths on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , leader of the Party left in the SPD @-@ German Bundestag ( R@@ ND ) .
Mrs. T@@ westen is not intended not because of her person as direct channel @-@ dat@@ in but on the Landes@@ List of the Dutch Green Party in parliament , so the Dutch members continued .
the logical consequence would it be that they return their mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD @-@ Bundestag fac@@ tion , s@@ ings a &quot; non @-@ democratic man@@ o@@ eu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ tor@@ ment in four years ago was clear : the people called Stephan W@@ eil as the Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann who leads the Dutch SPD as a nickname of German Bundestag in the German Bundestag . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now fal@@ si@@ fied the personal career of future CD@@ U members , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clear the backgrounds .
I want to know if there has been more or it has given further commitments from the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
Sponsor@@ ship for Ort@@ is@@ ers III
who wants to be gentle in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of ste@@ g city development took place on Wednesday in empi@@ res .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave once again a review to the so far failed .
since 1991 it has been in with emp@@ ties .
at that time , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg still has two thirds of the grant amount .
in the re@@ development area II from 2005 to 2016 the grant is still at 60 percent .
for sh@@ ind@@ ler , the previous re@@ perc@@ ussions are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to encourage the inner development , and not only include new buildings .
on April 4 , I received the information given by the Government of the Intergovernmental Conference to announce that there will be a re@@ building III .
the grant amount 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which rose 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest of the community received .
how does a re@@ development arise ?
one will continue to examine so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; truly old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role , whether in the planned field in general , to be re@@ done .
if necessary , the territory can also be post@@ p@@ one .
the ste@@ g f@@ ates on the Mit@@ ter@@ och@@ re Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
in the basement presented the content of the Bund @-@ Region of the Social Stadt , &quot; where the renov@@ ations would then be performed .
core of the programme are the rev@@ itali@@ zation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintenance and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would object in object , which is called per property , conducted .
the re@@ development process would eventually set itself as a propos@@ itional .
funding period for funding has been ongoing since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
even until September this year it would not even be allowed to take hold of it , as part of those involved in the refurb@@ ishment area involved a questionnaire to fill out .
in November or December , the order of propos@@ ing to take place in November or December should be commen@@ ced in the coming year with the refur@@ bish@@ ments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann urged that every Comm@@ une accused the occupied pre @-@ investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a point to evaluate the urban low@@ lands and decide when to be re@@ done and to what extent .
for the particular property there will be a re@@ development note in the text@@ book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will get to come again and get an impression about the situation , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Got@@ zel stressed , a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
therefore , there will be quest@@ ionn@@ aires who will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up to the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow Quest@@ ionnaire is the &quot; building and plot se@@ bow &quot; which among other things goes on the construc@@ tional state and the refurb@@ ishment .
in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; budget and home &quot; area , &quot; data can be made to size , layout and residents of a living room .
the Blue &quot; operating bow &quot; is to be squee@@ zed only if in the building business rooms are maintained .
however , the de@@ zel pointed out that a filled form is not at the same time an application for funding .
moreover , new measures are not being con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; wind &quot; gre@@ ens &quot; - who first comes , urged first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is no claim for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was shown to do the present a s@@ late &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets itself a micro@@ chip , to get to a handful of movement in house and car
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door@@ step , enter his office and even can be started by a handful of movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had spar@@ ked the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and fore@@ finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has addressed to Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory council meeting in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , mer@@ ged to ensure that the implant@@ ation method is carried out according to medical standard .
the technology res@@ embles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chi@@ ds and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars , that they are compatible with chip , all for an additional cost of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed at home as well as with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising cost of the White House are tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the decision of the White House , a nav@@ al helic@@ opter for an event to fly , which highlights American production in the last month , costs tax pay@@ ers according to the indications of the military , which were left to the TIME magazine , up to 24,@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17th July at the White House with American construction programmes .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and CEO of the White House made a tour of products made up of all 50 states .
the Hel@@ ic@@ opter helic@@ opter was issued in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ fts from Mississippi .
the military office of the White House called the presence of the helic@@ opter in a frag@@ mentary order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helic@@ opter came to the South La@@ wn , according to the record of Marine Hel@@ ic@@ opter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , which is responsible for the operation of the helic@@ opter .
&quot; I just wanted to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the com@@ mander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the dep@@ uty Marin@@ ek@@ om@@ man@@ de@@ ur for aviation .
the message showed that the helic@@ opter arrived on 17 July at 7 : 00 in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 pm , and so long stayed before the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure of the White House should be del@@ ayed , due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would need for the flight back .
the original flight time was to be used during the event at the helic@@ opter , while the security personnel of unit stayed during the period upon the plane .
from the documents made available , it wasn &apos;t clear whether ultimately a second airplane was required .
the H@@ atch Act continues to use state property for political purposes .
data records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event may hurt the determination .
&quot; a question we realized was whether it was an injury to the H@@ atch A@@ cts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant .
&quot; sound as if you are locked , &quot; answered the Deputy Commander .
the &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but even official events have political over@@ tones .
on the event , the President gave an impetus for the reform of health reform , which was ongoing at the Senate and pro@@ pag@@ ated the efforts to susp@@ end government rules .
the use of the plane that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically mut@@ ually advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
presi@@ dents are oblig@@ ated to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is un@@ common .
Tr@@ ump carried out a study in February when the presidential plane in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services resi@@ sted , and his Twitter account is full of announ@@ cements that use its predecessor through its predecessor through its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 countries that are made by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the dep@@ uty secret@@ ary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often lead man@@ sions in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn to susp@@ end the U.S. president in the White House with precise feet .
as a Tr@@ ump in early July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted in the White House of 58 exercises .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event en@@ during the training needs of passengers for the month , said an official .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ic@@ opter @-@ units are also flo@@ ating 11 hours on that day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Sik@@ or@@ sky said , the company had not been involved with the helic@@ op@@ ters in the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not enter@@ tain budget@@ ary awards for the presidential system , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost for the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the Ministry of Defence for fiscal year 2017 is the Do@@ D @-@ certificate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D yet 24.@@ 380 USD per flight @-@ hour .
records of unit record the flight time of the aircraft than 30 minutes from the hom@@ eb@@ ase of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ anti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of the operation of the helic@@ opter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for issu@@ ing measures is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance , and many other hidden costs , which are included in annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a ver@@ ge from the year 2015 , revenues for Do@@ D does not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at this time the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the helic@@ opter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present these week things that are manufactured in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the federal state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helic@@ opter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly .
of course it is appropriate to empha@@ size this . &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump is inter@@ acting with the helic@@ opter , when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driving @-@ seat of a fire@@ man car .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump becomes a representative of Sik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oking with the media via his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

&quot; it is a compact team that always plays a similar formation .
right on the lag@@ ged position I find the crew very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV primarily ensure the imports from the high north .
&quot; their plans and fin@@ ches can even refer to entries in the Davis Cup .

&quot; it is as always hard for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there you also need a good serving happiness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip in the high north is practical .

with fixed contact partners for the children and one assignment to the team .
in the municipal spaces , the clock will be revers@@ ed .
at the 1st of September the City of Kre@@ feld takes over the me@@ al@@ ment of me@@ al@@ ites in the urban nur@@ sery ( kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sonja P@@ omm@@ ance , dep@@ uty leader in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth aid &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked continues beyond home : a Cat@@ erer is taking care of this task and provides fresh@@ ly cool@@ ed .
the city operates in the fields of 46 children &apos;s area in the fields of 46 children , in 44 children receive a warm meal .
in the last decade , 28@@ 00 children stood at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children under the age of 45 are looked after in the cas@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ omm@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay up to 14 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 sub @-@ magazines come from 1st September kitchen service : they warm the s@@ late food , supplement the meal , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ing the meal individually , give the food prepared , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a cas@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ omm@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two group@@ ings as well as seven @-@ group@@ ing facilities - decides about the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen fort@@ resses now belong firmly to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says P@@ omm@@ intoler@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the time of kitesur@@ fing , educational strategies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it is also about healthy eating and cooking .
&quot; the children should help to prepare the food . &quot;
the direct connection of the man@@ ch@@ es@@ force of the team is sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the inf@@ ants of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen forces - is done by specialized cleaning personnel in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen service also the charm , which it turned out in the economy comparison between self @-@ reg@@ ain and foreign capital for the city as the most economical way , it is out of the press office .
and that , although 46 sub @-@ tim@@ ers will be re@@ adjusted .
&quot; but these hours drop out to approximately 750 people in the detection zone at all not as strong as weight , &quot; says Sonja P@@ omm@@ ance .

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie @-@ Fabrik in Glas@@ go@@ w
a trade union would like to register with managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it &apos;s Mc@@ Vit@@ ry on the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glas@@ go@@ w .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company felt on the future of investing in the cross @-@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which in addition to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea cookies .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owners Pl@@ adi@@ s said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he imp@@ lied that staff and union officials would be the first to know if their activities would change .
in a letter to the Fili@@ pin@@ ite of the company called for G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s to express his concerns that funding for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be promoted . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can not win any clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned .
generations of families have worked here and the workforce strongly focus on the local community and the Groß@@ er Glas@@ go@@ w , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , the Loh@@ ns and We@@ alth , and against the background of Bre@@ xit , the rising cost of living and the chronic production slow@@ ing , the for@@ er@@ ous end of Glas@@ go@@ w urgently needs a thri@@ ving production in Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
a Spe@@ aker of Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; the Fili@@ p@@ ites at T@@ oll@@ cross had only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland and the company will respond directly to it because we estimate the continuous commitment to employees and trade union officials .
we had a regular meetings with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the staff that we operate as any company operating in an extremely competitive and un@@ certain economic climate , our business is constantly checked - and that applies to all our business areas and sites - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested in our T@@ oll@@ cross location more than 5 million pounds , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as production hall , and completely . should our operations change on location , the employees and their trade union officials will be the first to experience this . &quot;

Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans thought that the club always has its best to take care of it since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but the soccer world had been warned about three years ago by the PSG Prize before this prospect ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any association who wish to sign one of the best players from PSG sign .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried , because they know that when they tou@@ ching one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact her players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to let one of our players will sign up with themselves , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have passed this line , among the Spanish society express an interest in the PSG Mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PSG distinc@@ tly that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by letting any of their prizes for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oters got tos@@ sed and damaged
during the night from Friday to Saturday , a well known perpet@@ rators will be seen at the König@@ s@@ felder Strasse in front of front of the estate No. 30 off sco@@ oters and so at the fair@@ ing of the vehicle &apos;s damage by more than 200 euros .
the police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 0@@ 74@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , ask for notes .
to an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese is looking for the police witness .
because he walked a car on his pilgrimage , the driver had to do@@ dge a VW Tour@@ an and touch@@ able the lines of the circuit .
on Thursday night the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was travelling with his VW against 19.@@ 55 at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area of the Stol@@ zen@@ au area of Stol@@ zen@@ au met him a car @-@ car on his journey , so he had to avoid to the right .
in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver had the lad@@ der .
on the passenger cars were killed .
the driver of the counter@@ ing passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had passed a truck and continued its drive without concern the traffic accident .
according to the in@@ genu@@ ity , it may well be good that the mer@@ ged @-@ driver had not noticed the accident at all .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Bericht ent@@ last@@ et Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( report on the mis@@ use cases un@@ poll@@ uted e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and histori@@ an Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report to the ab@@ ov@@ is@@ sc@@ andal in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues further for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ mann , Spe@@ aker of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained after publication from former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today &apos;s Car@@ dinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year &apos;s brother of the Emer@@ ald pop@@ e X@@ VI@@ . , an exc@@ use .
it would be very intended to regard the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express her deep shi@@ ver on their own sub @-@ appro@@ vals or their time wrong assessment of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ servat@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the fact that when reporting about violence in the cathedral @-@ atzen ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double ) measure &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the handles in Regensburg , no one knows that it would have to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; degree medi@@ al mani@@ pulation , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the author Car@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historians and a member of the national Italian bio@@ eth@@ ic committees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the day @-@ day experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep that for normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Princess in Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; you would like to go to the church and this is a sn@@ apped fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been a very normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to be ready with fre@@ ed children , like I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse of mis@@ use it is often the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , the author and histori@@ an Michael Hes@@ emann , who translated with R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s Comm@@ emor@@ ative band &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated in 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is at the 440 @-@ page report that is commissioned by the di@@ oc@@ ese scientist in the Republic of Regensburg and Ulrich Weber ?
total 54@@ 7 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were executed between 1945 and beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high consistency &quot; victims of attacks , 67 domain atzen .
in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in conclusion , the fact that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. could be applied in many cases of physical and mental violence .
even with high emoti@@ on@@ ality the punishment was also possible for the student .
nevertheless , unlike many other alleg@@ ations , a lot of victims under@@ estimated the general humanity from R. and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even connect positive memories with it . &quot;
in the interview he explains Hes@@ emann , why the final report on the ab@@ ot@@ tom@@ ot@@ andal in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion in@@ reli@@ eved .
Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ Pages report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of non@@ violence at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a conf@@ lic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
to a one raise many students his &quot; humanity . &quot;
secondly , he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and a perfec@@ tion@@ ist who has been persu@@ asi@@ ve of the bitter hand when a cathedral @-@ set has no top performance .
how do you see his bio@@ grapher this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the trouble and reads all 440 pages long from the front to the back , one has to wonder why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger seems to be found at all .
he has just returned to eight pages and he will be clearly acqu@@ itted of each suspic@@ ion of counter@@ - or fellow @-@ knowing during the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the violence in the pre @-@ school courses also ex@@ pose themselves outside of its sphere of efficiency .
at best , you can imagine it too late or have not taken seriously enough of it .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ul@@ asi@@ um , on which it was effective , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents , - as liter@@ al - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger clearly describes it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warm &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; knowled@@ geable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who manufactured the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons and always been surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority is compl@@ aining about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emoti@@ on@@ ality , which has also resulted in tan@@ qu@@ arri@@ es .
that he k@@ issed himself not only with chairs , and thre@@ w the be@@ ins and cast out all too che@@ ek@@ y guys to the hair or ears , he has commissioned himself many years ago , deeply regret and exc@@ used for it .
however , his hon@@ or@@ ary must be said however that such educational methods were widespread in the frag@@ ile time , the 1960s and 19@@ 70s , widely used in parents as well as by teachers .
do you also know such re@@ ins methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a world @-@ class school , a national gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what actually it is about in this report , namely the irre@@ plac@@ eable sexual abuse and the non @-@ violence at the pre@@ school , are the detached Bag@@ at@@ elles .
you wonder if it wasn &apos;t about his famili@@ arity with his role as a brother of Benedi@@ kt X@@ VI@@ . to do that many media have now cr@@ ashed on him .
in the Bav@@ arian pop@@ e , many those who have never understood him , still more sil@@ ly .
the truth however is : the report reli@@ eved Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media in connection with the report a lot about the subject of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the Final Report also some winding or fellow @-@ knowing in terms of sexual abuse to the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
not only the 67 victim of sexual gri@@ ps have claimed to have become familiar with the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never d@@ ged to talk with my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a sad@@ der acting for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse is and yet is that most of the victims are silent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they don &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not an choir manager who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators , would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regards to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ ed student form@@ ulating it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he had been properly acknowledged ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) of timely knowledge and could have had the respective employer .
I consider it ... also for a really absurd , accepting that ... against him ... Bub@@ bles initi@@ alled or more clear or rather more likely than about their parents , dormit@@ ories , confidentiality , etc .
that one speaks to him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is how the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who are familiar with the students and / or their environment , could not be confirmed in the framework of the examination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what sexual abuse is concerned is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger therefore by every fellow @-@ knowing .
so it may not be accused of having prevented him or put it on display .
therefore , there is also no reason to associate his good name with these contradic@@ tory crimes , as unfortunately in some cases it happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media was a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former cathedral @-@ master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown out in the report . &quot;
must he live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting all mis@@ ses and nar@@ rated to a vast mel@@ ange taken from sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and somewhere , in the middle of Er@@ in , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is precisely an abuse of the report .
there is also clean divided : between the pre @-@ school and the gramm@@ ar school of the cathedral @-@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence as well as , we say once , other alleg@@ ations .
moreover , the report also deals with inci@@ dents from time since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not chor@@ us of the cathedral @-@ atzen .
the whole terrible test ped@@ ago@@ gi@@ k , the cases in which Kn@@ aben of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers have been lev@@ elled and mal@@ ign@@ ant and among them escap@@ ed , be all@@ eted at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen und P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen where there have to be truly sc@@ and@@ al@@ ous states .
but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he got the boys to face when she was already on the domain .
on the one , as most of the witnesses emphas@@ ise the theme of &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; t@@ abo@@ o .
you was just happy to be escap@@ ed and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different in the domain of the domain of the breed ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there is a discipline , but there is no sa@@ dist@@ ic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many sacrific@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many sacrific@@ es the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even connect positive memories with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so at most still the accus@@ ation still remains to have had .
but despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre@@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and proceeds from the events at a school where he didn &apos;t want to hear and was responsible ( so the witness ) was nothing to hear , and then again at 1993 .
Ver@@ shut Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at the fore@@ front of his ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the domain of origin that the report is even re@@ produced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it shows that it will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the test will continue to be practiced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the risk of negative pres@@ ets , he recommended urgent agreement .
this was of course at a time when legal clarity consisted , as exam@@ ining also in Bavaria too long ago .
before that they war@@ med up in a legal gray area , like everyone of us probably still know .
there was difficult for him to estimate , where the affected may be exagger@@ ated or dramatic , and where the per@@ missible limit has been crossed .
but one can not say , he always had put away .
this is just not good .
after 1980 the test was officially completed in Bavaria too .
princip@@ in Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis claims yes , it is unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the dam@@ aging time .
how do you see it ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; pit@@ falls of the an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is the danger that has today &apos;s to evaluate the present moral standards .
since the prin@@ c@@ ess has already right .
but that of course does not apply to sexual abuse , who was vile at all times and also did not exist for what was sh@@ attered at the pre@@ school of ad@@ versity and violence at an inno@@ cent nur@@ series , that goes far beyond that back then .
it is all quite aw@@ ful and I am happy that it is finally being worked out .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in shelter , for all that had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and const@@ ip@@ ation , so ear@@ marks and ears to the hair and ears , were widely used in the 19@@ 70s .
when physical const@@ ip@@ ation was then forbidden , he has also strictly adh@@ eres to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his reg@@ ens@@ burger while has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because in discussions with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the topic re@@ fine as well as to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ kt X@@ VI@@ . , tells of his perspective , being played the cathedral @-@ atzen only a secondary role .
nevertheless , I am not at all due to that he held a stric@@ ter reg@@ iment .
but even this must be said to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without which we require Un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably hardly possible to form an institution of world @-@ renowned reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( institution of world @-@ tran@@ ce , true cultural amb@@ assador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ fires , one does not even make a big singer and stand before every success , right in which area , yet always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what kind of man have you experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , foundations , deep un@@ believers and heart@@ felt good people from which one could not imagine , that he could actually do something more than a fly .
I am frequently accompanied , like many former cathedral @-@ cats today , 23 years after its Emer@@ ging , regularly contact him , visit him , he is almost blind - and treat it as a member of their family .
those who have not for@@ giving him to the present day that he was once strictly speaking to them , thus clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are now grateful to him that he has enriched her life and has brought the world of music to them .
and that he is always a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ rier teacher - a tight father , sure , that may be - but still a lovely respect person was , to which she still look up and honor them straight .
and please , again , clearly : all one asked him , the educ@@ ator methods that then were on the order of the day .
we can be glad we have overcome these times a long time ago .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently , and has one still prominent brother , to make medi@@ al s@@ cap@@ ego@@ ats .
there is the evil intention that behind it , just too apparent .
because the report that was currently being published , reli@@ eved him .
now the attack there would be a 93 @-@ year old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and maybe even Germany no one would know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
