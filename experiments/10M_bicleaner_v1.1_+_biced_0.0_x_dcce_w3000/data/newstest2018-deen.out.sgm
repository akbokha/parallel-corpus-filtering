<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards, which change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit-chapel, where now is dug for the S-Bahn-tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Smallgardener manage the first cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card mouths promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is nervous when maps are not currently up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows each one had to look at exciting, because the car-Navi showed rather than a divestment road a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals of Bavaria of the State government, are anything but current - yet very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it is clearly how cities and villages in the spread-area of the Münchner-Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a Flickreppich, which one cannot recognise as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large picture-postcard for cities and municipalities are detailed cards, so-called Urals sheets, incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="13">This generation came according to the Bayerisches Vermessungsadministration between 1810 and 1864 and, at the beginning of the first Vermessung of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader invaded Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War of Aggression with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic record of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops went off with the peace of Lunéville, from 9 February 1801, there were today's neighbors, which formed the idea of a region-wide Bayern-Show.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max. Joseph drove the project further forward, founded the" "" "topographic Bureau" "" "- and therefore the Bavarian Vermessenger-administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The utility sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like to find all the others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of fruits / Today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is submissions that appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Shippers was divided into 21 years after creation of the map, thus 1877, as Münchner district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, subsendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses submissions are concentrated in 1856 along today's Plinganserstrasse, which was named after 1878 by Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today is the western park, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: at Hineinzoomen a small-partying map with dozens lines and numbers: handwritten numbered flyers are derived from the so-called "urine" from which the property tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots show there today no farmers show more - but" "" "petty-gardener" "" "land in the sun." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space is built north of submissions.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 swingplace of the Oktoberfests, was in the 19th century actually a meadow - and no concrete.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the first position one reads in the district of today's District Au-Haidhausen not only the street named "at Gasteig" or from the ascent "On the Lüang" but also in big letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse, you once again bet people with madideals.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 the Münchner Kreis-Irrename "was created on the Auer fan."</seg>
<seg id="34">Since 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden appointed the institution - that psychiatrist in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was knowned for his time and ended up for example the Ankhing of the so-called Irish." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He is also forbidden to apply force to the passengers, to apply force against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the Anstalt Museum.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, later it was expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime, this capacity is no longer considered - the reason for the construction of the cycles in hair of 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">There has been the Isar Amper-East-East in Munich since 2006, one of the biggest psychiatrists in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the site of the former Auer Anstalt now young people meet in the Münchner Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order dewarns the building complex 1920 and walked him in a youth-home with training programs.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is located the football field of TSV Munich east, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, you set up the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" - in the architectural culture based on the origin of the Irish mat, which was destroyed during the Second World War by bombing rails.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was in 1856 as the main square, "the department name was called" Kaufinger alley. "</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War even in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies took many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great stayed until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business houses and a pit-chapel from the Middle Ages was once the Marienhof where these days were working and on 5 April 2017 the Spatenstich took place for the second S-Bahn.</seg>
<seg id="49">The old Munich-Card can be compared with the air-image of today - and the hole at the Marienhof can be arranged.</seg>
<seg id="50">Ombudsman released before travel-up for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The national association to promote farther has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory politics and the racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Consultation to the State of Missouri, which should come into force on August 28, 2017 and take great care when travelling through the state, where a series of fragile, breaches-based pre-seizures may occur in the whole state and described here," stated in the opinion of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law by Missouri, which makes it more difficult to fight discrimination, as well as the prosecution of the state, the disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to release travel warning said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, people happen.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are raised because of their skin colour, they are assembled or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we listen to complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard before." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group flawed incidents like rassistic hikes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under unworthy circumstances at the beginning of the year, after having no petrol surveillance during the trip through the state and taken into custody by the police by Missouri, without a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also pointed to a recent report of the office of the general State-old from Missouri, in which it is shown that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more frequently to be halted as wheat.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and staff can inform about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be willing to bring Caucasing or let their relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate speech in 2015, according to the latest figures from the Hassverbred reporting period of FBI, which entered the state with respect to the number of such injury on the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to complain a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Society (ACLU) travel openings for Texas and Arizona, after the States immigrant laws were adopted, after the States immigrant laws were obliged to suspend people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to the further rattle regulation on the ACLU on additional rattle regulation.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel openings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries but in recent times, interested parties have had a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weidiscreet project is Elear</seg>
<seg id="68">The fisherbacher Weights project is a success project and continues to be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestags Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have gained a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the case of the founder of Schwendemann family, representatives of the fisherbacher CDU region met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann confirmed first insights into its operation, in which it houses 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cattle, and as many young people, and houses five apartments of Feriengths.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Schwarzwaldmilch" is for him the alternator vergregate for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Ferienges there is only regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">As he is also the BLHV president of Fisbach, he described the hamlet project as "Elemental important."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not manage on such levels surfaces any profit.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green space is prepared for a lot of work, much muses with the motor sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and with the Topography" "", "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the eleventual operation and managing these without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not lead to bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the Weighing project and is pleased with the leader of the leader." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">The farmers must be supported at costs of 3000 to 4000 Euro per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope that the forestation of the surfaces can be withdrawn even a whole while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure that we have, people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how to continue their operation," "" "said the Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often due to encouragement</seg>
<seg id="84">About the Weights promotion, a total of 25 plots from eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure area is 40 hectares, which should not be afforested by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">The total cost of the total cost of 71 500 Euro was funded half over leaders, a quarter carried away the municipality of Fisbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, farmers left the farmer 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometers of wheat.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac said: "you do not make a really good job, without farmers and women, it does not go."</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter White stood firm," "" "here best food produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The "" "" "" "LandsLeave" "" "(LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of wheat compences." ""</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence of one of the LPR testers by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">Furthermore, the enclosed area may not be appropriate (Hanging over 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by the rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fisherbacher Weighaunching project 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots that would like to cut nearly 16 kilometres fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The disclosure area covers 35 hectares, the calculated cost is more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump becomes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime transfer is when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the most careful fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fira Place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key-ideologues of the Trump-regime, knew surely what he did, when he took a symbolic Axt in a heat conflict with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals by the president to drastic limitation of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller accessed not the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of shipowners and Liberty Imitators would have accumulated him if he would have done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he laid their significance in, and in particular the meaning that you have been written, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "as Miller Acosta," "" "I will not go here in a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer to which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually correct, but as it did not formulate it, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about contemporary resonance on the ragging words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your exhausted masses, who are longing into inhaling, free to breathe the fall of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time in which the" "" "elongation" "" "on our screens was better to be seen." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller dedicated himself not to literary critique - it clearly made that these people are not welcome in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict with the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends, who campaigned to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that it is accomplished a top political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicism by placing the female embodiment of freedom in a abused classical representation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no more abstract - she has got a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives himself a very different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus, the importance of the statue changed, people from the right wing had long restrained this long ago.</seg>
<seg id="118">The big scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was no one, but rather an early Neocon that bring the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is progressing.</seg>
<seg id="119">She is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the Fackel should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limergh on something encountered.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is totally and even a question of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative effect of Lazarus consisted of seeing them as they from the exhaustive but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships has been seen.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of men who are looking for refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome which they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump will ever wish to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch is not intended to enlighten the way, but the hate, who is their only source of power to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="128">Worldchampionship 2017: Neil Black lobbish chottish members of the United Kingdom team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two villi belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-piece Scottish checker is made for a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of shotish athletes was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="133">"" "" "" "we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue to continue until we find it," "" "said Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">"" "" "" "I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done." ""</seg>
<seg id="135">The shamans athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliantly. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish Athleten are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butters - which to compete against Sir Mo Farah at the 5,000 m distance while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the crew to the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her captain talk was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or where they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were highly motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and genuine feeling that eastie certainly brought together were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth of silver medallists, who will compete for the 400-m-hurdles, says that it is "incredible," that 16 villi are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total to athletes in the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The Mid-River Muir leads on this path and was placed five British and two European recruits last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m runs, is another Scotsman who wanted to observe the victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">She is reminded of her first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in the Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">The creationist chapters says that they are "enormously proud" to the fact that many of their compatriots do not only belong to the team, but in some cases also be merged with the medals and at the Finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "the special about team captain will be in it that it was elected by the other members of the team so it's a great honor to know, but knowing that my team-mates have voted for me and have chosen, makes it something very special for me," she added. "" "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the villi who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to rise to poetry.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, because we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and to benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and compete and it'll just be such a great atmosphere out there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking reviews on Facebook: don't beil you to a public if you do not tolerate the introductory of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our land knew something of a bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans deed George Washington, but it did not last long until the newspapers suggested him because of all, from internal policy up to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He claw in the critique, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid, and wordless, we shall take the sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland at Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to work more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">The employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Society complained him therefore at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The pab of the Governor was caused the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is just Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second position of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not an reactionary hoshead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has demonstrated a firm hand with the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as primores means to connect with his voters and to debate his haarless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">That is why the blockage of people coming on the side of the Governor - which is a public forum, which is referred to as officially, and by collaborators who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defaulted Hoan Sprecherin Amelia Chasse the actions of the Governors and argued that the blockages of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the picture of TROLLEN or spammers or hedge people who wavered online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talks with some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just genuine people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not a role.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all told their comments are respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor Hitied the Bible in his post and appealed to Hoan Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bowie, MD., was not heter, but she asked to hate.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I get excited that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate speech and other current news," wrote them in the commentary area of the message sending "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people take a stand on the same subject, they are believed in some people rather than a so-called collective effort and recognized not as a large group of affected people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the employees of the Governor's" "" "concentrated Spam attack" "", "would probably be called" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocks a critic or a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that people have been sent to collect newspapers with critical indicators and to burn or to burn demonstrators or to silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is precisely what happened just digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise it that he implied Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump will suaded by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell to Virginia last week.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County completed the First Amendment, according to the U.S. District Court James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she called a voter on her Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from ACLU on its use by Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">Currently Washington's time had a similar effect to Washington's time as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplies between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter, swallows on his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had an anonymous troll.</seg>

<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed their bags and sold out.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before, I lived with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I searched for something that was compared to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">This flat was shown in Earls Court and had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I have fallen in love and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot was completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-robed estate with a rusted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage room and a mezzanine to make the generous ceiling height optimal.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To this end she commissioned the architectural and Designstudio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms exposed to each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine to stand in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative, in order to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel plant is rather complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the spaces so they were overflowing with no one we had to pick up.</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform but to create the steel so that he had the correct height for the function above or down." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement allowed the fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine looks a classic classy window of Retrouvius via the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Sepieged Goldfisch, Silberne accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set out the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to let him seem longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance offer mirrored units place for all seating and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorned space the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Interfoldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">What is special about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," explains Erfan from the reinforced, furnified MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is mutual, so when you move the door very easily, very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an extra bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the basics - or how your property is valued," says Refan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a property makler will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials to provide the room to its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional connection in a home," says Refan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not forget to enter into the electric plugs in walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can turn into something very astonishing by good design and increased square footage of something.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, as Joanne, you could decide to leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight because of an 500 million U.S. dollar-imperialist</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the nasty in a confrontation because of one of the greatest real estate of the Victorian Victorian worth more than 500 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former Director of the 'Carlton-Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul removed. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and its assets are being divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul has wanted to withdraw itself from the family business since 2014, but a sharp shift over the separation will take place in the Supreme Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers underscore 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family has since 1973 a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>

<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now comprises offices in the city centre, the development area of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">According to an agreement with their dead father, Colin - by Paul as "main operator and the dominating personality" were described in the Family De Lutis, about two thirds of the company's power, and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court states that this means that Colin properties is worth $35,million dollars and Paul is worth 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>

<seg id="1367">On Friday last Friday, he took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - which Colin, like Paul claims to be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argert, this is not true, but it throws Paul before, some possessions are incompetent.</seg>

<seg id="1373">Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi, Italian immigrants who bought the milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950's years and bought a business in Brunswick.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If yes, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Stef of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow on President Trump - including reports of news media - in the hope to keep the chef on a more competitive course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"" "" "" "when John F. Kelly, the new staff Stef of the White House, at his first working day with leading staff, he set up a major problem in President of Donald Trumps white House which he plans to consume: bad information coming into the hands of the President." ""</seg>

<seg id="1396">Cellars diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tump to tump their media diets.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Traces relationship with television ranges decades back - and now, where he is at the White House, his TV shows still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "when Candidate was upset up, because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he got a fair reporting of places that were to convince," "" "said the former election campaign of Sam Nunberg in February against Politico." ""</seg>

<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter would ever be "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these combat stagnants have something that we others do not know - that mumps will not contain even more ignon without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We are probably never experienced a bit about the tweets that has not sent Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff managed to keep it away from him some times, if their efforts were worth it, their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented it that Trump-pulses produces.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a white house that bind themselves out from competing parties, always try to promote their own agenda by promoting Trump material that may possibly promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - especially occupied with this story - reported in May about the preference of adviser, the president of strategic reasons questionable information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example, that was described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react such as a volcano on negative press releases, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he can figure out how they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened in late February, when someone signed a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the internet provocate Charles C. Johnson, who used the deputy Stabefin Katie Walsh, "said the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson had banned from Twitter because of chicans or that he has no concrete evidence or that he has expressed false allegations in the past and revoke them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started to ask employees about Walsh. "</seg>

<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager as Priebus but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still seek influence.</seg>

<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the damalous ambiance company mbH, the 13th of April 2014, approximately 30 000 nights per year was lost annually, and also receipts of the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In fall 2014, in the light of dramatically rising figures of refugees who arrived in the rural district, the hotel buildings dedicated to the property office as a collection accommodation, provided for the controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by establishing a development plan in order to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">At that time the decision was not contentious at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But especially Fredenstadt Oberneumeister Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious-increasing interest in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group of Luisenhotels with leader in Bad Bergzabern, the former Hotel Birkenhof has acquired a voluntary association in Berlin and wants to get back to a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter facility.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Menalb.</seg>

<seg id="1464">The rooms are fitted with large walk-in showers, the entrance area will be redesigned, new windows are incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="1465">Everything seems to be "beautifully bourgeois" as that Thomas Scherer expressed.</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of gem."</seg>
<seg id="1467">Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are among the facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1468">If one does not want to position themselves at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale city level, was emphasised.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms would greatly set up broadly.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agrarian institutes CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the past few years and in the autumn a lot more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the life span of lavender.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist emphasises the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the Woolenzeitung Riodoce usually meet their plans for reporting about the youngest chaos in the state of Sinaloa through the organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drugs wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what more safely alike: you should take their children with the office until 2009 were the goal of an attack with granules, or make them home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Safety experts have written three words on a plate on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporter, names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and pancreed.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drugs, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspicious at the secret of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no reprieve of violence and while throughout the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto have taken up office in December 2012. 589 are faced with assaults and threats under judicial protection and so far there was at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter, her editor and their inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Its lack will be felt deep, although its presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, which shows his middle-finger with the word "Justice". two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which demonstrate its smashed face with glasses or its typical Panamera.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although the law was established in 2010 in order to resolve the cases of journalists, this according to the committee has introduced the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with the most thousands of murders, each year with drug-trading and organised crime are incurred, the murderers of journalists are rarely put to trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although it is uncomforting and although the terrain is now even more preserved.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information on the murderers, without justice, the meeting gave a little benefit to the discussion of security, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," says he.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, we strust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital's capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed just to drive a couple of blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was raised by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with "Twelvth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The archer ran away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans perpetrators of last year and the extradition in the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bludiest battlefield in January, as rival factions are struggling to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of deserved, two-story mouse een for drugs that are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "forget for a minute that there is a state of" rest "" "" if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trades in the United States. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, owing to the debt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">Initially, in February the publication of a interviews with collective o Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling party fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected of gangsters sold every copy of the issue once they were delivered to newspaper files.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second error was to force Valdez not to force after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had released the same story to leave the country to its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killings are regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues would say that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He served as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he worked together with five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "", "it was impossible to operate journalism without encounter on the dowry problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With time the newspaper earned a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting, and revenue and publicity.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter loved to publish hard-looking investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Award" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committees to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drugs, wherever it was leading.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily to that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to live," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ distinction." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug-drug in Sinaloa" "" "is a lifestyle," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you must assume the task that listens to you as a journalist - either that or you play the Dumas." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do in view of so many dead... why did you not say what was before?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the Spaaster, who was about a longshoreman, the friend, the generous with hugs and rates, a teacher, who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his guard.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Well they ask: was his love for the routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions regarding how to get their job done best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"you do not like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their canny start and runways, to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is even at the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-keeping.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing with Javier has happened."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others say, are in Sinaloa no longer - just as they are in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes steadily.</seg>

<seg id="1873">Half in the baiz, some of the reporter, if these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen, who are the Governor himself as trusted.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporter went to the Berglandry, where the drug players are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has concentrated on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There were the assassination of the Bruders of the former known boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the government spending, focused on the governor of the Governors.</seg>

<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy strawling.</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers have found out that this plant-evore is covered, although it is covered with an armor and is probably under threat from meat.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a screening technology, which is known as a counter-coating, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This could have been allowed to mix better in his environment and avoid its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurs made the first time headlines in May and is now shown at the Royal Tyrada Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild beast and called the Borealopelta definitelli after the Museumstechniker Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen allowed us to hear Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the patterns and the form of shoes and armaments via his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shady, a widespread Defense method in the animal-empire, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shady is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living alive today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points out that the dinosaurs was haunted by sufficient pressure due to meat-handed dinosaurs because the evolution that favoured the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that put the counter-shaking - think of deer, zebras or rubber, are much smaller and vulnerable as loot, what signaled that this Nodosaurs was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behaviour on a massive, strongly armored dinosaurs clearly show how dangerous the dinosaurs-robbers of the Cretaceous must have been," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic connections in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was reddened.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists still examining the animal in references to his life, including his conservative Darminhaltes to find out what it had eaten than its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, driven into a river and driven to the sea, where he sank on the back to the seabyss.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as South florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely much more displaced than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurs is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preservated skin, but it remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the beast," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early Cretacetime.</seg>
<seg id="1954">They do not need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you just have a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is at sleep. "</seg>

<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus rex, million years after Borealopelta lived, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his terrible ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tonnes heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose recent findings appear in the Fachzeitschrift Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was reconciled after death in the sea and has been verified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the most preserved dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle up to the hips.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long points, which raged on his shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document ourselves, what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came to Ferrell in mind:" do you want to document or tries to find a story that you can take advantage of? "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of the black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which, after the killings of the Black Teenagers Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the film "BlackmovesMatter" in social media identify itself as a sultry.</seg>

<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern part of the pedestrian precinct, since the first presentation 2009, the population has turned into supporters and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the subject hardly any one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Also on our Facebook-page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the topic is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to say to the Bit Gallery: "this would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be genuine class (Nicole Schauest), comes from the other side:" don't need a man "(Siggi Boccupy) or quite simply:" size wahn! "(Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocates are building that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, of which the other businesses benefit, fear the enemies, that then attacked the pedestrian precinct.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Add: the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall is in the 13 direct market market offering their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work it will be finished.</seg>

<seg id="2109">You can see how many cargo business here are empty, some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a proper weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains at least.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because after all, the goods offered here is fresh, largely offered directly from the producer and is observing.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, cargo stores are located in a shopping center only by larger companies, as the local people are often not viable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, specialty shops are almost no longer and what of it still is, will probably also disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a marker fits for me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where is the farmers market hall towards the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - also in the duration when the bit-gallery is actually coming.</seg>

<seg id="2122">But for a farmers market hall, it is thanks to the insane many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg is no more space.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the farmers market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces see - white, black and brown that are almost incomparably identical - hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagal of Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts that were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison of Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence service analytic made a 35-year-old prison sentence, after being classified as secret diplomatic reports on the website WikiLeaks publicly.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibit which was opened on August 2nd is called A Becoming resemblance (An appropriate similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagal, whose discipline must join her field of expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and landmark disagreement whose nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey Hagal has been created by the algorithms analysis of DNA that could be extracted by Manning extracts and produced from the 30 portraits of DNA, such as someone can be interpreted with these genomic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the indurent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already talked openly about the identification as a woman, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 prosecution, including six offences against the spionagegesetz, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only a single photo - a body-big, black-white self-self, in which Manning is visibly sits on a driver's seat and a platinblonde perch carries - with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagal came straight from the great success of their 2012 project "Stranger Visions."</seg>
<seg id="2134">This produced the artist portraits of strangers from forensic Artefacts like cigarette rubber and chewing gum in bringing the DNA out of waste, to produce a picture of what these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when they received an e-mail from a newspaper press.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they did an interview with Chelsea Manning while being in prison, and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to join this article," explained Dewey-Hagal at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit at this time and she could not photographed, so she took contact with Chelsea, and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her intimate Muse were joined to an unequal penpal, which over two years have several letters interchangeable.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one by Shoot Kanungo Illustrierte Comic "suppressed images," who would foresee a future in which the President swamp judgment and they would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days, after the book was published, Manning release was published after seven brutal years of a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now in the opening of the exhibition a little deep and Starke, since Donald Trump takes a war on informants from the governmental camp and against transgender forces to find new, tweaked ways to defling the rigid divisions, which he actually should fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagal was asked about the strange timing of all of these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a part of the gallery of the gallery represented by the artist's artistic statement, among them (the "i" in their family name is provided with a heart) an end of the "automatic defragmentation, whose basis sex, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousands of cladding of Cs and Gs and As, written in graphite.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagal hoped, to demonstrate through the inclusion of 200 letters (or Nuerotide after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), how amazing, at least in biological ways, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what will hopefully bring about it is that our genome takes no account of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagua, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of those stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition is stored in a separate room is a page from above mentioned Comic-Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning as it appears in the hands of the disciplines of the United States like King-Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they address your speech, then they have won" "", "says it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "" "" "so never the mouth." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was predicted in the coming-book - but if they should do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simularity like hordes of the Protestant simulations.</seg>
<seg id="2155">That was also target-focused like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning statur), when their genetic hapologies were written with pencil.</seg>

<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">But there was no state programs, and we will not admit that which does not exist. "</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mut's words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian anti-doping-Commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In discussion with the Russian sales bureau RSport at the beginning of the day, smirnov came to problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, then added: "we have repeatedly said that the report describes controversial positions and regulations.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Sigrett wanted to measure luck with your e-commerce start-up but the surveys do not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague to be very helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you said anonymity, some workers know the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there were simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has got people from outside to help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is on the wax to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it allows companies to address surveys, special groups and demographic groups, and in some cases Whistleblowers will allow the C-suite managers to get and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and FitBit for the persecution of their health, but where is the FitBit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools used by companies to compete employees.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Salvation said that they have a better insight into what your employee think and feels in the three years with Glint won.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat-map of the company that shows on a glance which units have most ailments and which executives will have low consents results - so you can refrain why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to view that at the head of the workplace culture need to remain so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in Skandale since then a former member has published a blog post, who describe an environment of harassment, with those who have spoken to be punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups as well as Glint, this wish for an overview is an lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be more than $118.7 billion value in 2020, after the finanztechnical site let's talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Converters, the company helps to prevent the bad behavior and to realize, saw an ascending interest and activity beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber finds in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Converpiece has almost 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like Glint, Convercent companies tailor-made "pulsation" surveys, confidential answers in real time and view the warmth maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline with which the employee can report about this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the main business leader is included, complaints should go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the condemnation of public opinion has recorded the Regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and Managing Director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that his staff is treated badly or is unethical, it can be costly consequences by consumer-boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant-chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, Convercent has been used for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their company.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if a clerk wanted to report a problem, he or she had to locate a phone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to pursue the discomfort of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company Converters uses, problems that were previously reported and addressed in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or ignorant practitioner are identified quicker.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360 degree from sight to experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who runs the risk management Group from Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employing legal dispute." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Company started to reap ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "Social Media" "" "came to their right that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor the ethics, people used hope as a strategy" "", "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Converters offer your software as a service, and loaded the company with recurrent fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that will support the approval of venture capital Investors, which both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Converters received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the whole capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Celebrity secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and holding its entire funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising, considering the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is an increasing complex of research that shows that today's employees are expecting more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as silicon Valley are high salaries and interesting projects only inserts.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The staff want to feel that you are accepting and esteemed and that you give your time a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that ranks their votes and that the work that you do is worth, then they feel more strongly committed to making this company successful," said Alex McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience onLinkedIn, which uses both Converters and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors achieve return when their portfolio companies are well run. businesses are running well if employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the Analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and use of the employees, it's no wonder that you find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data about the employee engagement after the experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the steward of a firm is not taking action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Indeed, if a company asks employees after your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change is not fast enough, or not at all, this disappointments can grow and motivate and employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen it very much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you do not follow associates," "" "have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care for?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And if you don't care about it, why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now manages monthly staff surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And following the collecting of feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganise the decision-making and the quality of communication, capable of organizing several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights on the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better bond of workers in a industry which is known for high revenues.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose man," said Vitrano.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"and if you lose man, you also lose customer.</seg>
<seg id="2258">And if you lose customer, you will lose your company.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it cannot be any crazy, there is a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robot.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible robotics) (FRR) published a report on developing sex robot in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we must start to take their rise seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of nipple and the type of surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make themselves funny, but companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more frequently," "" "said Mr. Sharkey on the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex lips have developed from their inflatable partners to robotic partners with a silicon retina that feels warm - with consciously human responses that can be achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can adapt its robots according to his convictions, "and thus select everything from the eye-color of the robot, about the shape of nipples up to the type or the color of his fingers.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it will be even more disturbing, as many robots had the "personalities" who would have a stepped-woman like progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex lips have evolved to robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Realbotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties which they find responsibly, as for example renching.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex-robot with pre-programmed figures such as Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shouting and" Wild Wendy "with a" adventurous "personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality, which is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warms the website of the True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So you like what you like and they don't like what you do not like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">During the day, in the course of the day, they also have their moods - very much as real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it may be tired, fixed on conversation or she may be" "" "in mood!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the most submering female properties, taking a step towards Frigid (is called here: disruptive) Farrah zudema perseverely a most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a VIBRATOR, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a VIBRATOR, why do men then have no Roxxxy?" it is on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a fetish or simply just another sex-tool.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and their increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture towards a withdrawal of the ideal for gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as a optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course keep no sex robot, and whilst the FRR have their rising popularity, they remain even preliminary on the verge of consumption culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what has seaped out of the edge-zones, may be in terms of the spirit of time in which we live, be very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting, until they free the free market there is permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">But there is a certain overlending that these highly developed sex robot in a time arise in which the rights of women are threatened, where there is a president in the White House, who has fiery women to have sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of Magd ') are not the graphical images, the devoured body and the extinct eyes, but how realistic this vision operates.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, to the point when it comes to its "personalities," the robots are not actual women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">You can not separate yourself from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no placement or a background history, nothing that hints on independence or anything that could disrupt the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Otherwise expressed, they are counterfeit slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the oratory of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Mumps's large performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the epitome of healthy human rights</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a binary of the Trump era that the political divisions which polarized the US-constituency, also families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and harvest feast, there were newspapers with Ratings about how to deal with the horror of Trump-related relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all supposedly asked to put our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of mumps, families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my couscousine, a ultra-oriented poet who lives in Chicago and has long been dealing with republicans in our family that this week has visited in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everybody knows which she knows, including the Republican kinship, with which she fought for decades due to politics, suddenly and completely unique on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it falls me in a further context that this will also bring significant risks to it.</seg>
<seg id="2434">"" "" "" "the left was reinforced by Trump, but the continuing effect of his presidency has the power to move all to the right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "if we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that the kittens of one day will no longer be rejected." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, a terrifying long-time scenario, normalized in the Trump Republicans of the right wing, "that suddenly appeared in comparison to its standards as a term of denial.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself nowadays from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the backwarring - the dog on the car rental, which saw 14% income tax (but at least we knew about his tax return) - which occurs both compared to Trump in fact a very mild offence.</seg>

<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to Karussell in Central Park, the largest of the New York Parkett's car department, and the best three dollars that can be found in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are cooler and the animals twists to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely finster and the freshness music conveys this in a noticeable manner.</seg>
<seg id="2441">As many stereotypes of a city of disappoint: the views of tall buildings are old, the skylines are becoming more familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Five and thirty years later, and I'm still not quite revealing the day when I found that Swiss Cottage in fact no Swiss cottage is - the topic-pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage not - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, Central Park-Karussell is still a strange experience since here two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-17 years can be on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have advised the carousel, I would have given him full marks, but luckily no one has asked that afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was compelled to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could undergo my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the Coffee-House at the corner of my street, it is the same, plus the option to get the rating with a 15% drinking tipping - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>

<seg id="2491">How exactly does the software update take place?</seg>
<seg id="2492">Must diesel-driver take part in the action?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers in a nutshell:</seg>
<seg id="2494">At diesel, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW-Group offers software updates for a total of around 5,3 million cars.</seg>
<seg id="2495">The aim is to improve the emissions of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and partially in Euro 6.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study argue exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, affecting around 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300,000, causes gastric cramps and blacks, recurrent or bloody diarrings, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are usually get married, meat and dairy products are usually out to relieve their symptoms, found researchers at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contribute to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant Darm.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leitner researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the intestine patrolling to ensure that harmful microbes, which hide in the food not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, which are able to trigger inflammation, are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far toward inflammation, it may result in inflammatory Daring disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments proved that a kind of tolerance-promoting immunity is found in mice, which carry a certain bacterium in their injectors.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the principal blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said, "" "" we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice in its food had, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one to tryptophane nutrition has more tolerated, less inflammatory intestinal intestines, if the same system also acquire at people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan underwent a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as it had figured out that a group of study ws had such cells, but another group of the same tribe but had been separated from that.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspect that the difference with the intestinal microbiomen of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms which usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The damme of mice became DNA sequences, and there were six bacterial species available in the mice with the immune cells, but without them mistaken with the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were reared in an sterilful environment so that they had lacked a gut microbiome and did not get these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria opted on the immune system, the researcher L. reuteri have to grow in fluid and overcarried small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on inripe immune cells, which were isolated by the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune-cells developed into the tolerant-producing cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified out of the liquid, it proved itself as a by-product of tryptophan metabolic disease that is known as Indol-3 milan acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in feed the mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophanvalues have been halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerant conducive cells such as mice, and most of us L. reuteri protect us in our stomach-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known if tryptophan adrenal products from L. reuteri develop the cells in people as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found among people with inflamed intestine disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said:" "" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>

<seg id="2903">What exactly is at the 440-page report that is commissioned by the diocese scientist in the Republic of Regensburg and Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">Total 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were executed between 1945 and beginning of the 1990s "with high consistency" victims of attacks, 67 domain atzen.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "in conclusion, the fact that by Domkapellmeister R. could be applied in many cases of physical and mental violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Even with high emotionality the punishment was also possible for the student.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, unlike many other allegations, a lot of victims underestimated the general humanity from R. and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even connect positive memories with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview he explains Hesemann, why the final report on the abottomotandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger of his opinion inrelieved.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr Hesemann, the 440-Pages report on the "incidents of nonviolence at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">To a one raise many students his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">Secondly, he also appears as a choleriker and a perfectionist who has been persuasive of the bitter hand when a cathedral-set has no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you see his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the trouble and reads all 440 pages long from the front to the back, one has to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger seems to be found at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just returned to eight pages and he will be clearly acquitted of each suspicion of counter- or fellow-knowing during the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violence in the pre-school courses also expose themselves outside of its sphere of efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best, you can imagine it too late or have not taken seriously enough of it.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzengulasium, on which it was effective, was perceived by virtually all respondents, - as literal - "salvation," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "in this way, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger clearly describes it as" "" "warm" "", "" "" "knowledgeable" "", "as an extremely good-natured teacher, who manufactured the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and always been surrounded by grapes of children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is complaining about his perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has also resulted in tanquarries.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he kissed himself not only with chairs, and threw the beins and cast out all too cheeky guys to the hair or ears, he has commissioned himself many years ago, deeply regret and excused for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, his honorary must be said however that such educational methods were widespread in the fragile time, the 1960s and 1970s, widely used in parents as well as by teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such reins methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a world-class school, a national gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what actually it is about in this report, namely the irreplaceable sexual abuse and the non-violence at the preschool, are the detached Bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">You wonder if it wasn't about his familiarity with his role as a brother of Benedikt XVI. to do that many media have now crashed on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope, many those who have never understood him, still more silly.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth however is: the report relieved Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media in connection with the report a lot about the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger in the Final Report also some winding or fellow-knowing in terms of sexual abuse to the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not only the 67 victim of sexual grips have claimed to have become familiar with the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dged to talk with my father or mother about it," "" "said a sadder acting for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "" "" "the real problem in educating sexual abuse is and yet is that most of the victims are silent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they don't even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not an choir manager who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen student Ratzinger's role in regards to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned student formulating it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he had been properly acknowledged (Georg Ratzinger) of timely knowledge and could have had the respective employer.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for a really absurd, accepting that... against him... Bubbles initialled or more clear or rather more likely than about their parents, dormitories, confidentiality, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "this is how the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "people who are familiar with the students and / or their environment, could not be confirmed in the framework of the examination." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is concerned is Georg Ratzinger therefore by every fellow-knowing.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So it may not be accused of having prevented him or put it on display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is also no reason to associate his good name with these contradictory crimes, as unfortunately in some cases it happened.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media was a lot of" "" "violence" "" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former cathedral-master Georg Ratzinger is thrown out in the report. "</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting all misses and narrated to a vast melange taken from sexual abuse and non-violence and somewhere, in the middle of Erin, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is precisely an abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is also clean divided: between the pre-school and the grammar school of the cathedral-atzen, between sexual abuse and violence as well as, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Moreover, the report also deals with incidents from time since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not chorus of the cathedral-atzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible test pedagogik, the cases in which Knaben of sadistic teachers have been levelled and malignant and among them escaped, be alleted at the pre-school in Etterzhausen und Pielenhofen where there have to be truly scandalous states.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he got the boys to face when she was already on the domain.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the one, as most of the witnesses emphasise the theme of "pre-school" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">You was just happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different in the domain of the domain of the breed?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there is a discipline, but there is no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and that also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many sacrifices "" "" many sacrifices the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even connect positive memories with it. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2959">So at most still the accusation still remains to have had.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and proceeds from the events at a school where he didn't want to hear and was responsible (so the witness) was nothing to hear, and then again at 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Vershut Georg Ratzinger at the forefront of his ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the domain of origin that the report is even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "it shows that it will continue," "" "that in the pre-school the test will continue to be practiced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the risk of negative presets, he recommended urgent agreement.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was of course at a time when legal clarity consisted, as examining also in Bavaria too long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they warmed up in a legal gray area, like everyone of us probably still know.</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was difficult for him to estimate, where the affected may be exaggerated or dramatic, and where the permissible limit has been crossed.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can not say, he always had put away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just not good.</seg>
<seg id="2971">After 1980 the test was officially completed in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Principin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claims yes, it is unfair to apply today's educational standards to the damaging time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the "pitfalls of the anachronism," that is the danger that has today's to evaluate the present moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Since the princess has already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But that of course does not apply to sexual abuse, who was vile at all times and also did not exist for what was shattered at the preschool of adversity and violence at an innocent nurseries, that goes far beyond that back then.</seg>
<seg id="2977">It is all quite awful and I am happy that it is finally being worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in shelter, for all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and constipation, so earmarks and ears to the hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical constipation was then forbidden, he has also strictly adheres to this.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his regensburger while has Georg Ratzinger because in discussions with you for the book" "" "My brother of the pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the topic refine as well as to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedikt XVI., tells of his perspective, being played the cathedral-atzen only a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I am not at all due to that he held a stricter regiment.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said to be said: without this perfectionism, without which we require Unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly possible to form an institution of world-renowned regensburger Domspatzen (institution of world-trance, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bonfires, one does not even make a big singer and stand before every success, right in which area, yet always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">"" "" "" "what kind of man have you experienced Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I met Georg Ratzinger really well and experienced as wonderful, humorous, foundations, deep unbelievers and heartfelt good people from which one could not imagine, that he could actually do something more than a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I am frequently accompanied, like many former cathedral-cats today, 23 years after its Emerging, regularly contact him, visit him, he is almost blind - and treat it as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiving him to the present day that he was once strictly speaking to them, thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are now grateful to him that he has enriched her life and has brought the world of music to them.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, väterrier teacher - a tight father, sure, that may be - but still a lovely respect person was, to which she still look up and honor them straight.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, again, clearly: all one asked him, the educator methods that then were on the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome these times a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominently, and has one still prominent brother, to make medial scapegoats.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention that behind it, just too apparent.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report that was currently being published, relieved him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the attack there would be a 93-year old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and maybe even Germany no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
