Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I always put in drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this made the Hollywood star in an interview un@@ ambig@@ uous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always put in drawers or painted outside the label , which usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not have the desire to be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frank@@ ly speaking , these things are more straightforward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only lau@@ gh that it is as a &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as it explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mopolit@@ an . &quot;
in the lover , the act@@ ress spends her time at home , in front of a television with lo@@ cker@@ em Dut@@ t and Mexican food , it is in the magazine .

Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sport@@ y pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger said a little variation with some colleagues on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CHI@@ O : &quot; Golden Sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses rec@@ alled their cars , they hunt in fast Gal@@ lop in the house to feed .
a kilometer at this speed , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and with that the horse race ended up again already again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament organizers - again close to horses .
he allowed himself to lead to his family about the plant of the AL@@ RV on a horse , he doesn &apos;t even le@@ ep in a photograph .
long was the first time in Aachen , and with it also on CHI@@ O .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports motiv@@ ating the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small g@@ ala in the context of a small g@@ ala , the Golden Sports pyramid .
at distin@@ ctions it is not a li@@ ke@@ able ath@@ l@@ ete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ wert@@ kreu@@ z , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already served him .
langer is the 18th prize winners of the pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winners Hans Günter Winkler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for she is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger has fo@@ sters the offspring .
and so the prize money of 25.000 Euro were on the same .
with 15 other outstanding sports , the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports . &quot;
among the excellent are the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , der Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard , Alexander Pus@@ ch und Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , der Ru@@ oka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spring@@ oka Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um der Hand@@ sh@@ aller Erhard .
many of these sports embar@@ ked on Saturday after Aachen .
after the official part , the illustr@@ ative society went into the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza cost ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept a gap to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and tr@@ umps &apos;s economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade in the TT@@ P - this both Clinton and Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential competitions are in control and energy policy as well as in a single market policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the differences in economic policies between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
the , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep in mind rather small and war@@ ns of how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton wants to dism@@ iss the economy and adjust to death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he himself wouldn &apos;t be different , claim@@ ing Tr@@ ump .
he will strongly re@@ trac@@ ted regulations , and it is strong for the far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax @-@ modes - for both individuals and for businesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state has specific duties to meet , he has the dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , the taxes would increase for the rich , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the issue of infrastructure .
in the m@@ isses to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost wor@@ shi@@ fted .
the Democratic App@@ lic@@ as announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state capital programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are strictly opposed to the state @-@ State Te@@ apart@@ y @-@ wing of the Republi@@ can Party .
thus Tr@@ ils can therefore still be in internal discussions .
significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump will build coal turbines and restore the coal production in the USA .
oil @-@ makers should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris@@ ian climate agreement he wants to cancel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton is about to expand and challenges the renewable energies with their investment programme : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country becomes the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
however , not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two cont@@ enders are not too far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ fish trade deal , both do not want to sign .
at the same time , both the US want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but they simply want to protect American jobs better .
the people should also be better paid , about Clinton .
the current minimum wage from 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a fam@@ ine .
it wants to raise it up to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump will do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must r@@ ins@@ ist , then he says , he will not be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop rather more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand stands Tr@@ ump , who wants to relie@@ ve the economy and its citizens to boost growth .
his critics spoke to him , so the budget defic@@ it would only grow bigger .
on the other hand Clinton , who at least want to demand from the rich , that they pay more taxes and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; flight : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every sanctuary of woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who run alone , almost already to everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers escape .
in a large kitchen sitting four women .
each one has a baby with a maximum of one year old .
one has laid her little son in my arms .
he sho@@ cks with big eyes curi@@ ously in the room .
his mother is gaz@@ ing on the table .
until she noticed that it is observed .
it sm@@ iles short and k@@ issed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
by talking to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is a leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women at the escape .
the four women in the kitchen are pressed .
they live in the Mün@@ chner North in one of the few de@@ centralized housing for women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the facility working together with Pro Famili@@ a and Mün@@ chner Frau@@ enkirche .
recently , it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are none - also not as visitors .
the exception is a wax in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ation to say : every woman who arrives here has done on their flight experiences with sexual violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men escape because of wars because they will be prosec@@ uted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them as a hope of hope to Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; among women try other reasons for the flight : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secre@@ tly because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home country you have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sion , hon@@ or@@ ary pro@@ stitution , pro@@ stitution of slavery .
this is driving them away .
at the escape goes on .
&quot; That diff@@ ers for example to create a bottle of water a sexual act , is no rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that as soon as they produce in Germany , mist@@ aken , tells B@@ ahr .
here , all women of refugees would often be considered to be inf@@ eri@@ or and wor@@ m@@ ess at best .
this leads to about 90 percent of women living in the North in Mün@@ chner North , it appreci@@ ates them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so usual that they have nothing to say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t trust , openly talking about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not help her we@@ ary , there are more accommodations just for them , demands B@@ ahr .
the seven districts of Bavaria are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
to the question whether she uses from a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction area , answers some with no .
there is such a difference in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are so much in the governments of the governments .
even in Schw@@ aben alone , women are not separated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokes@@ man of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Unter@@ - und Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are some shared stories or private houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study that was published to the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lacks privacy or are men and women together , it may come to - on @-@ going violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the washing rooms should be easily accessible and easily accessible for women , in the study .
how much women feel in need of compreh@@ ension , it is possible to escape the con@@ gest@@ ion that gives it to the house in Munich .
&quot; it has been talking about having been around us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
you could easily get a second house .
assistant doctors : demands for new working measures
representative of the assist@@ ants have called their trade union to take new labour @-@ ups in their dispute regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( b@@ ma ) has called for its entire Council to get more working measures from beginning September .
the J@@ DC told that there would have failed to respond to the concerns of the contract .
assistant and medical students have agreed in July about the ref@@ us@@ al of a contract that was agreed with the b@@ ma .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members responsible for the elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to members who published on Twitter on Thursday night , the Chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen &quot; &quot; &quot; said that the government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; per@@ sever@@ ely calm &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said that the treaty was rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view , the J@@ DC Management Board voted to fully reject the proposed new contract completely and requested official re@@ talks to all E@@ states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC committee has today provided a formal application for a special meeting of the b@@ ma to take a continuing program of escal@@ ating labour measures , beginning of September . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the disputes resulted in that assistance in this year was six@@ sm@@ al markets , the first total waste in the history of the N@@ HS .
the director of the managers of Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions , which were advised by the b@@ ma .
he shared b@@ ma members during the sessions that had still taken before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the treaty was beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Minister Jerem@@ y Hunt is that the contract for physicians to be introduced in England .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of aliens &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that a crisis ended .
leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and announ@@ cing an official end of eight months a long @-@ term war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin brought his Turkish counter@@ part in the g@@ ild@@ ed hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ ray in reception , I can not honor the im@@ prints that Ankara wants this reconciliation most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but pl@@ in sm@@ iles was un@@ alli@@ ed and he has barely lifted up warmth , even for its with@@ standing relationships .
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , talked to his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times .
it could not count any more .
he said likewise , that relations with Russia could not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better to improve .
the next day he described a newspaper that Erd@@ og@@ an would have been heard as if there were never something worse .
seemed to me more the opposite .
but one of Putin brought radi@@ ant , sustainable cool , that the State of Russia had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his quotes , the plane of a Russian figh@@ ter plane at the border with Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was to be crow@@ ned .
Putin told him and accused Ankara to fell in his back .
going out was even bigger , since it was committed by a alle@@ ged friend .
the Vet@@ r@@ auen re @-@ building will be difficult if it cannot be impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
months long the state @-@ controlled media led a severe , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed like the Tur@@ ks to blame for everything .
on the serious test , alleg@@ ations of leading officials were that Erd@@ og@@ an has prof@@ ited their own family from il@@ licit oil trade in areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this veh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look ahead .
finally , this meeting took place just because Putin received the President of Erd@@ og@@ an what he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a cease @-@ fire are clear on the hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an is primarily needed all the friends who can get it after spending the last month at a failed coup d almost his home .
repet@@ itive terror attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey in particular - in particular the ban on charter flights which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel agents and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated if the flights are res@@ umed .
you are counting on a delay in the Mediterranean bush .
this week , they projected the state @-@ television , cheap fruit and vegetables once the Turkish agriculture will be imported again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti it follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an added political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fu@@ ri@@ ous to the West as it is the response to the tried to power tak@@ eover a weak answer .
to do this , the lasting Gro@@ ll come across the sn@@ ail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to take advantage of the cool atmosphere and to reduce the relation of Turkey to the West .
the Russian head of President gained a bonus in Ankara with certainty that he sear@@ ched for the prosec@@ ution and asked support for the elected officials .
this is well @-@ known for Moscow remains a matter of course , which itself has a deep @-@ sitting fear of reg@@ im@@ plant .
the summit in this spl@@ endor@@ ous palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey as it pro@@ ving me to represent an analytical drive &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that come across from the West and eventually feel po@@ or@@ ly treated .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the greatest difference between Syria , where Moscow had recently played the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey have counter@@ posed ones .
it could be signi@@ fying that after almost three hours of initial talk both president at the press conference said they would not even touched the issue once .
the president of Turkey assessed it visi@@ bly on a question about their differences , while Putin decided to empha@@ size this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denomin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open host@@ il@@ ities - and considering the potential for a complete dis@@ aster , when NATO inter@@ f@@ lowed in Turkey , it is certainly better that the two leaders are talking to each other at least .
Royal Bank of Scotland not available for customers outside Scotland
the R@@ BS brand is supposed to be reduced to a b@@ back office according to the fore@@ head of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for customers outside Scotland .
ROSS Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with the fact that the brand R@@ BS were connected with the global ambitions of the bank .
the Bank has since been dis@@ soci@@ ated since its eight years ago , and had to be saved and saved .
in this time re@@ bran@@ ding &apos; R@@ BS &quot; used to protect other end @-@ need finan@@ z@@ ags .
it supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all r@@ s@@ b references , the de@@ centralized quarters and the stock market will change to Nat@@ l .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private customer business , which are more important than C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand R@@ s@@ b will become our Invest@@ ors &apos; and the brand under which our staff will be busy as we are now more to a bank of brands . &quot;
as the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS has become a global brand .
I am now saying that we are not pursuing a global targets but local goals .
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our staff will work under these brands with customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer lead to six Nations sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the perception of the different brands in their sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop into the bank of the Marche , because how do we focus inside ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the fore@@ head .
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these marks .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think will see many changes .
we can lan@@ ci@@ ze these brands again , so I think the time has come .

I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ers when he cat@@ ches the victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacles - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the re@@ tired 20 @-@ minute winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 vic@@ tories in a recru@@ iting career .

Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it is not a surprise that he has reached this milestone , just a few in front of him .

he is a fantastic amb@@ assador for the race , enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans already enthusiastic for years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he would have picked up 6,000 prizes , if he would not only be a weekend and grand@@ son jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already suffered winner in GB for nearly 30 years , which is great .

Russia Putin moist@@ uri@@ zes staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin brought out his staff , Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the closest family relationship of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as the Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin without st@@ ating for reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ivan@@ ov &apos;s dism@@ issed his duties as the chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who stayed since 2012 Ivan@@ ov@@ s Substitute was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
1972 born in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his completion at the prestigious State of Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it is called ( Russian ) that he subsequently became the Office and the Office of the government .
he said about his appointment he said to Putin , &quot; thanks for your confidence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a head of laws concerning legislative measures and controls in order to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked for his post to leave his post and to be V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convinced the ridicul@@ ous faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov has been a long time in one of the nar@@ ro@@ est confidence of Vladimir Putin and works as he works for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as a charge of Stab@@ ili@@ ef he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television broadcast both men , that the staff returned to his own wish .
but despite the surface for cameras , here are few of them convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here is a result of a kind of power @-@ fighting ?
this is what nobody currently knows .
but the official statement - that a man who was once challenged as a potential president , at once the Russian environment wants to be guided - came to great sc@@ ep@@ ti@@ cism .
in his remarks about Putin , who are quot@@ ed on the site of Kre@@ ml , Ivan@@ ov &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say this very complicated post for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov adopted the post in December 2011 .
he was then dep@@ uty prime minister and defense minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin &apos;s former member of the National Security Council of K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin Chairman of the B@@ und@@ essi@@ onal authorities ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his dep@@ uty chairman .
when Putin put his power in his power , Ivan@@ ov was regarded as one of five people whom he trusted the most familiar .
it was once assumed that Ivan@@ ov &apos;s second term president could become President of Russia , as the third presidential of Putin would supp@@ ress against the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , in@@ coming allies Put@@ ins , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister , before he became president of three and a half years later .

Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now with Fi@@ fe connected
the £ 4.2 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have linked the Nord@@ deck of the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ adu@@ ct - what does the bridge now associated with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four con@@ cluding the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clo@@ b@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion for each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the brid@@ ging section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 ton .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 parts parts .
the £ 4.2 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017 .
the Minister of Economic Affairs Keit@@ h Brown , construction site was a visit now and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the heart of ferry cross@@ ings .
we are all witnesses of an engineering of engineering from a truly ep@@ ic dimensions in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel which alone could be used for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the Br@@ ück@@ ende@@ ck is a sensitive activity that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total , nearly 79 % of the complete br@@ ils at their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks gets today in Ros@@ y@@ th a cont@@ ong@@ ation for the deck , meaning that the entire Deck is prepared to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , Project leader of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first con@@ sortium finds a significant milestone in each Br@@ ück@@ en@@ projekt .
in this fantastic project the closure is pione@@ ering high and deep@@ ening .
after installation of the last street show and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close still existing gap in the north or land side .
this was reached by drag@@ ging the Northern fe@@ eder @-@ bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was massive and at the same time very sensitive activity .
massive , as the vi@@ adu@@ ct was 222 meters long , weighs approx . 6,000 tons and at a slope of approx . 3 % to be drag@@ ged .
delicate , as the toler@@ ances , on which the team work , tiny - on each side they ro@@ uted only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .

&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lucky to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after they were tos@@ sed off the fishing boat on fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI lif@@ ebo@@ at station on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST Alarm , after a crew watching the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulty in security while their boat moved out of their own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat was turned around and placed us the worst before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of the lif@@ ebo@@ at station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank@@ fully , the strong winds used the boat from their range until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fisher@@ man &apos;s boot , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found on a bu@@ oy without lif@@ ebo@@ dies .
they all came abo@@ ard the Co@@ ast@@ al Bo@@ ots and were brought back to the ambul@@ ance station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were cast into the water were lucky to hurt and still be alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;

difficult inju@@ red - man j@@ ear@@ ed on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and badly inju@@ red .
like the police declared yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to bring his personal things .
rather , the cut of alcoholic k@@ iller is the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when I came into the apartment , he put it twice on them .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was inju@@ red by his hand and on the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ rators .
during the 50 @-@ year the clothes of his ex @-@ friend destroyed , he called his mother .
this alarm@@ ed then by his sister .
together with her life , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
this is why she went out of the house with her life .
in the street they met the ex @-@ partner of the man .
when the two women betra@@ y the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ olds would send his sister to the side and hold his ex @-@ friend .
who builds Braunschweig and cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green Mobile : investors should be taken much stronger in future in future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one respond to bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hand@@ made concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next council session . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet arguments is programm@@ ed .
first and foremost , it is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments actually ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CEO Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Green party : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to build on urban areas in future , should end 20 percent of all the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can also be made in the inventory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the big issue in the city hall is , however , such as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is the deal with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to use such areas at least 10 percent , but as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new municipal construction activity programme that will cost millions and needs to be financed , should provide incentives for incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , such as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the Left wants even more hard@@ ship for investors .
regardless of what , as Brat@@ mann , there is a ti@@ ghtening of the situation on the housing market .
if the manual is implemented , it will ensure additional tasks in the construction administration .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will receive the professionals .
but the program is not entirely clear : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , that should be built already .
how does one compar@@ es the loss of more about 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , whose funding will be taken over the next few years ?
only by the year 2020 there will be 500 apartments .
to prevent that , so the planning of planning speech in Nicole Palm , should now be ash@@ amed of the city now .
moreover , we would have to be expected to return apartments back into the price binding .
this is possible in the western town .
to one fell sw@@ oop the problem could be solved .
for in the West city they run to the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get back into the price list for cheap apartments .
only : this would not want the owners , the housing corporations .
for the number of social apartments in the Western city is again dra@@ st@@ ically dra@@ st@@ ically , one moves from the goal of so @-@ called .
there should no longer be a concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Green Party means that there will be even movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chief of the Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a vast majority , the CD@@ U must take into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have concentrated on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
that te@@ ens and child to play no longer outside , but rather prefer to spend their time outdoors , scre@@ ens to scre@@ ens , has been w@@ ailed in the last decade of many .
for Pok@@ emon Go , it &apos;s about getting people from the couch and become more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to television , then on video games and last on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive .
I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were based on the characters who were first created for the video games in the 1990s ( later resulting from an cartoon animation , playing cards and other spin@@ off@@ s ) .
like many phenomena in the population , the interest in the launch of the game in the U.S. , Australia and New Zealand was slightly different in the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries has been postpon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon has had more users than Tin@@ der and nearly as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons which are tr@@ acked with a GPS and once they once have been found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( about a screens@@ hot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when they were younger , joined the W@@ ahn and sp@@ rang up for the search of the sofa .
in the USA the game led to a considerable rise of steps that returns the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Car@@ di@@ ogra@@ m , an app for Apple Watch , the 35,@@ 000 users informed , the Washington Post reported recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who of which Pok@@ é@@ mon Go plays - it merely doesn &apos;t see the raw data on the performance enhancement .
many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to take &quot; 30 minutes &quot; time , &quot; out of the couch , &quot; and &quot; to be active on do@@ ve ears as many public messages are boring and coming from people who look like .
nevertheless the importance of sport can not be over@@ rated .
who drives a regular exercise regularly , reduces his chances to deal with cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in controlling control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonder@@ full of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people even ex@@ clude new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always there is a Sty@@ rian player who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what is it meant ?
it is a breakthrough that is made .
even if smartphone apps such as the Fit@@ Bit has been following our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us reason to do sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will leave with time .
due to Pok@@ em@@ ons , however , there will be more games , the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ites are combined in the real world and help many people on the hunt , more active , fit@@ ter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the D@@ ament@@ um
forget the print .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all this imm@@ un .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
ef@@ fort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the floor .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now finally Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ erin .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast is ens@@ lav@@ ed on Thursday to the multi @-@ jack@@ pot and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world from all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ es@@ sk@@ ates adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ a@@ alli@@ erin Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ k@@ icks on the pig @-@ bal@@ king during the occasion for women at the Olympic Winter Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , th@@ urs@@ days .
Bil@@ es is the fourth heter@@ osex@@ ual American female , which wins a multi @-@ kamp@@ ft@@ sman and a total of the fifth , while being det@@ ained their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all .
it broke up in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey was in this moment an end .
this success makes it the same league as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps , which brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es domin@@ ates the last three years with the sport of sport , including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , that the Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ erin from 1984 Mary Lou bail@@ on by her said that she &apos;s &quot; the best Tur@@ ner@@ ist , which I have ever seen . &quot;
they anticipated there was a last inspection in Brazil , a contest which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of excessive expectations .
not going back with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as disappointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace after they won gold and silver in the retail world during the Summer Olympics in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , won
Bil@@ es won the first med@@ al on Tuesday , while it served on the retirement party who served as a retirement party in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a fe@@ ti@@ al sign .
although it insi@@ sted that during her long journey on the top , never before has planned the future , this is not really true .
some of their b@@ ills - which include their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin music , which would be fit on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
it is not an accident .
this girl , adopted by their grand@@ parents as a small child and was adopted by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school@@ ing in the gymn@@ ast@@ ics , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has not lost a multi @-@ party competition since the summer 2013 , a winner series that will last as long as it wishes to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even if Must@@ af@@ ina was easily led by two scre@@ en@@ ings , tr@@ aps the picture .
float @-@ beams and bo@@ oms - in which Bil@@ es holds the world &apos;s master@@ ing - lau@@ gh .
she finished again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig and replaced with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground yet another .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g@@ ged her gently as they were her grand@@ mother - a pure form - and tears p@@ oured out in Bil@@ es sh@@ iny red , white and blue Eyeliner , as the vision that she described once in their manual book , was a reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when she went to the third place , but the bronze medals in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old Mann@@ es@@ skap@@ it@@ än@@ in , who is called by the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their bot@@ anic practice they thre@@ w the public Kus@@ sh@@ alls , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes appeared dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as for all the rewards so quickly the th@@ ah@@ leit@@ ner of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week has a completely new meaning :
police : 3 victims in serial waste in the car p@@ oured in the car
according to police reporting which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot , which had been killed in one of the k@@ ill@@ most serious attacks in the first series of mass mur@@ der@@ ers while they stopped in the car and listening to music .
Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , the authorities said .
the off@@ ender of eight nuts from a handful of fire @-@ monkey while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then flew with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police declared that the triple murder does not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber @-@ case , because the ag@@ g@@ ress@@ ors did not take the hand@@ bags , or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who took possession of an adult victims .
the pol@@ ish @-@ pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the sho@@ ot@@ ings joined the investig@@ ator to get a close look at it whether it is connected to four previous attacks .
altogether , predomin@@ antly in His@@ panic mo@@ wers are killed in nine months in nine months and two others were inju@@ red .
&quot; it is done in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; Howard of the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , the beginning of the month .
it is thought that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles including a brown be@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence they have led to the conclusion that attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alised due to their injury and died later .
Lin@@ er , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died in the spot .
a witness shared the police with that it was not unusual for her to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the lo@@ op@@ holes that deri@@ ves on an empty pick @-@ up truck for half an hour before the tri@@ pop@@ e murder and assumed that it was the work of the mass mur@@ derer .
investig@@ ators found patron saint and in@@ sured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball frag@@ ments from the engine space .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ c@@ ephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
as most 6 @-@ year old , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto the singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of its antiqu@@ ities , Ed@@ mund micro@@ c@@ ephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic interference , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto during pregnancy did not know .
when he came home first time , my first thought , I managed not .
I don &apos;t manage that .
after that I don &apos;t let myself go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course one left behind it &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her was told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize them , and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they sm@@ ote him to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not know that people still do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund was able to neither sit nor cr@@ ack down to his third year and he can still not speak .
but it is slowly making progress .
he can run with support and cycle .
he also likes to play and sing with his two brothers and sing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ed@@ mund for &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing @-@ language at , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical character language -- it says . Ed@@ mund has inv@@ ented some characters alone .
micro@@ c@@ ephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as Mas@@ ders or the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it affects the lives of the infected with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto are remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of a certain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still do not know it really .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pre@@ diction for a long time because I didn &apos;t expect that anyone can truly say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects that have been caused by the c@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
intense ra@@ inf@@ all , flo@@ ods on cause for rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Mississippi
intense ra@@ inf@@ ants and large @-@ scale flo@@ ods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forces the govern@@ or to call the govern@@ or on Friday the emergency day . it is counted all Saturday more than with more regeneration .
numerous rivers in the southeast Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the c@@ ant@@ is flood@@ ed its banks and dro@@ h@@ ated with large @-@ flo@@ ods , after extreme rain down , reported the National Wetter@@ dienst .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Ed@@ wards said that government officials are standing in constant contact with the local authorities and had already travel to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ ations des Govern@@ ors , divided with that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags multip@@ lied .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a ten thousand sand@@ bags would have been requested .
a flo@@ ods system is used over long parts in the south Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service allowed us to drop in this area additional 3 to 5 inches to rain .
in the south Alab@@ aster , a flood@@ ing system was deplo@@ yed on Friday while in the area Mobile continues to rain .
the river Com@@ ite close to Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite close to D@@ enh@@ am Springs , which are both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are all likely to reach over the weekend record level .
the met@@ ere@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers may flood@@ ed many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a down@@ stream flood@@ ing into Ascension Par@@ ish represents a threat since these gri@@ ps rivers will only be flowing in the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Tick@@ F@@ w , south of the Mississippi ste@@ er in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached on Friday already at 0@@ 9.00 the highest booth which was ever recorded .
rescue man@@ ams still hat@@ red people out of the flood@@ waters in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the south @-@ west of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step @-@ son came among those who were saved on Friday close to Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which usually lies more than 400 feet from his house , overnight in a sharp rise .
he said that there would be another step @-@ man who had warned that he had warned .
&quot; we have awak@@ ened and the water flows and flows in , &quot; said Hans@@ ford .
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she lived there during the 48 years in which she had never seen such a stron@@ gh@@ old of the river .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities and He would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire@@ guard in Glo@@ ster where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flo@@ ods began to spread quickly , because there were heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and that the authorities would consider Ev@@ acu@@ ation instructions .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer t@@ ended near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil has been significant since Wednesday since Wednesday .
the authorities admit that serious ra@@ inf@@ alls and street flo@@ ods the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and Te@@ aching in five bor@@ ou@@ gh@@ s .
the C@@ BS subsidiary of WW@@ L reported that a subsi@@ dy in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 sw@@ amp@@ ed houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches that were now flood@@ ed both .
the ruler of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities were saved 72 people and seven pets who were r@@ ins@@ ed by the flood .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , shelter and lod@@ ges were set up to accommodate the ev@@ acu@@ ated .
&quot; once the water starts back , they will return to their homes , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , nearly two d@@ utz@@ ing streets were closed due to the flood and sand@@ bags for the inhabitants of the people who hope to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; the last big flo@@ ods we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum told by the city administration .
this seems to become a similar failure .
in TS@@ pp , the Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Co@@ unt@@ ys , said that it continues to rain on the golf coast .
according to his statements a handful of houses were reported on Thursday as a flood@@ ed but on Friday we have not been reported .

Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; by balls , ext@@ ingu@@ ished , &quot; survi@@ ving shooting in Philadelphia
the police tell that the 6 @-@ year young boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 @-@ year child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Mah@@ aj Brown .
the grand@@ parents gave that brown has suffered several crow@@ ds , including in the evenings , legs , arm and belly , but that he was in mind with his transport to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has performed a lot , his small body was crossed by cake , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores det@@ ende@@ z to the radio station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just cannot believe it .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in one hospital and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the family of the boys told the transm@@ itter with that it is expected to recover .
he would have supposed to start the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot at three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year old .
one of the 29 @-@ year men is in critical state ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable state .
the boy was shot at the front of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who is located in a critical state , reported on the transm@@ itter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police determine whether under one of the most likely men of the perpet@@ rators are .
investig@@ ator made C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several guns .
pat@@ ron@@ age for storm @-@ cur@@ se , which were trac@@ ed to various assault ri@@ ds , se@@ wn the Tat@@ ort .
it seems that this is a clearly un@@ equi@@ voc@@ al battle on this occasion .
on the road , on both sides of the walking road , we found out .
thus it seems to have been here several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; the police haut@@ p@@ mann Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di the police in Philadelphia in Philadelphia .
there were also several houses and vehicles met in the area .
there came to no defense and the police are currently scrut@@ in@@ ised reports according to the monitoring video .
on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross @-@ h@@ unter at the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West O@@ ak Lane .
she recovered and the police is still looking for a susp@@ ect .
why we need guidance , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I put forward in the Tur@@ ing Olympi@@ ad in the Tur@@ ns and this is more than one reason .
firstly , I have been organizing the Olympics from 1984 to each summer and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three Tur@@ ner@@ ves , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which are inspir@@ ational for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ cles is , round , making every proud .
this team finally reflected the USA .
it has captured the black and his@@ panic woman presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among the female gymn@@ ast was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americ@@ an@@ ist .
last year we were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ag@@ ew@@ inn@@ erin and America celeb@@ rating .
now , the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple power of the triple world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as it has been unexpected , but master@@ fully Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ical routines .
on Thursday was Simone die fourth , heter@@ osex@@ ual American , who won in an individual seminar event for women Gold .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see sport classes in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie suggested all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the ol@@ ymp@@ ic team .
they are the &quot; last Five &quot; because the next Olympi@@ am@@ ity is going on only four tur@@ ers in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer .
but the reality tells you that Tur@@ ns is an expensive sport and can be maintained first and foremost in private turn@@ outs , which are maintained by parents for the training , insights , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their Tur@@ ner and families ) . the list may continue to be continued .
the majority of these sne@@ akers are located in wealthy suburbs which can support the business .
in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner will receive her entire training and that is a most expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , train@@ ee of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both trained their athletes and since they started the gymn@@ ast@@ ics .
we must be inspired to the congreg@@ ations inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a powerful and easier in@@ accessible gym .
I founded my Turn@@ foundation for 20 years .
with my events we offer free and affordable tur@@ keys in Harlem for over 15,@@ 000 young people ( especially black and his@@ panic ) and national and international winners have been trained .
in September we are expanding to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to provide high @-@ quality turbines that will make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great ol@@ ymp@@ ic sports .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and identification for the mind .
this combination provides life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bringing thousands of young girls to interest in the gymn@@ ast and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
it is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by und Ma@@ dison for this true representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the ol@@ ymp@@ ic Mann@@ schafts@@ gol@@ ds and thank you , F@@ ass gave her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors wish to organise further strikes after they rejected HI@@ y H@@ unts proposal
the Ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a reform@@ ierte contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association Agreement , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 assist@@ ants who voted in a vote bor@@ row@@ ed him .
in July , Hunt had revealed to introduce the contract in part , and said that the N@@ HS was temper@@ ed in a &quot; low land &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients were harmful .
the first wi@@ z@@ ards are to obtain a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend working to improve the maintenance of time @-@ times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ court , Chairman of the b@@ ma commun@@ cation for assistance personnel entered the last night in a communication with : &quot; assistant doctors have serious concerns , in particular that it will heat the current staff crisis and it is administ@@ ered to cover all doctors . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at only eight weeks , who still remain left until the first group of doctors will fall under the new treaty must be made progress and the time is running out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by the b@@ ma to resolve dispute through discussions will take part in the government for re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ance and sometimes silence on a de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this happened by an speaking , the Jerem@@ y Hunt had made just over the last month , that his door would always off@@ ense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt must act now to raise the pre@@ condition and worry about the worries of the assistant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should he not do this so it did not make the assistance in@@ arians clearly that they are willing to carry out further labour @-@ measures .
the last strike in late April saw a sur@@ ge of nearly 13,@@ 000 routine operations and 100,000 occasions since Nur@@ ses and specialist doctors were involved to provide doctors on the strike .
the Ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the reform@@ ierte treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the b@@ ma would like to make a better shift pay@@ back for the 5@@ 4.000 Assist@@ enz@@ eller , which will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employees , called the assistant to end the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; labour @-@ ups do not reach any of the only little , but already loaded teams and service providers , and prepare the patients , p@@ ents and their families only worry , emergency and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
during the last two months we talked to the Com@@ itt@@ ee of the Assistant in@@ arians and responded positively to the concerns with the Ministry of Health and other Minist@@ ries .
the employers hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility on training , additional training for those who were returning from a vocational training , training , mutual recognition of the cur@@ ri@@ culum , training holidays , and the Ministry of Health on the observ@@ ance of agreements with the b@@ ma in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ pro Tag@@ - medication that may reduce heart attack
thousands of heart suffer@@ ers will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ a day drug after by the authorities , having been advised by the authorities to submit this more people for an extended period of time .
the anti @-@ powered medication ticks are reduced the risk of repet@@ itive heart inf@@ anti@@ ated for people with a her@@ ed@@ itary disease .
the drug is administ@@ ered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of failure or another heart attack .
the N@@ ICE &apos;s regul@@ ator N@@ ICE has recommended a four years of intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE &apos;s regul@@ ator N@@ ICE has recommended a four years of intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffer from another heart attack or stroke .
heart@@ beat and stroke will be caused by accum@@ ulations fatty material in the arter@@ ies that form the cover@@ ings .
when the Bel@@ ag @-@ breaks , it may cause a blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
when the blood @-@ comes is rede@@ emed , it can flow through blood stream and keep blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who have already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk to have another .
Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is driven by the sur@@ name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces that risk by making it more likely the formation of blood cl@@ ots .
the conduc@@ tivity letter of N@@ ICE , which was released today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of N@@ ICE Health@@ care Research Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary education , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack or a stroke - often with disast@@ rous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that ticks are in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further cardi@@ ac ar@@ du@@ cts and stroke among people who already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are glad that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people that benefit from you .
the information on the effectiveness and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the blood risk - is limited for a period of up to three years . the approach is recommended not treatment that amounts beyond this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ites leaves elec@@ toral fraud in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ el , Rah@@ man was removed from office last year due to corruption from office .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tum has led to that far @-@ spread election was ignor@@ ant in Muslim par@@ ishes like a crus@@ hing government report today .
the former cabinet member of Sir Eric pic@@ kles re@@ ver@@ bal the police , elec@@ toral candidate and Rath@@ es@@ thous@@ es to have ignored the evidence of obj@@ ections to eth@@ ni@@ - and religion .
the former minister of integration and Communist government , which is now as bad as the inti@@ mid@@ ation of religious motives by religious mot@@ if@@ s so bad that the police should be allowed to set off guard outside of elec@@ toral envel@@ ope to protect the voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should lead to a reference with themselves in order to prove their identity to elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , voters must call itself his name and ad@@ ress .
the report proposes to with@@ stand the finger of a person when she gives her vote , to prevent that someone is chosen twice .
wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to un@@ com@@ ings and decisions of not official commun@@ es or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only for elec@@ toral fraud , but also should the municipal government before the wider cor@@ rup@@ tions and finance culture , which goes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets elec@@ tor@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special court decided that the am@@ inc@@ ing Mayor Lut@@ ain , Rah@@ man after a Lit@@ ou@@ ei sent to corrupt and illegal practices of his am@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court was that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of its Muslim community &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and that he would have brought his critics with r@@ attle and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man shall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his campaign on the basis that it is the related duty from Muslims , to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation in which a person cho@@ oses than anyone else .
Sir Eric said that there were evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he was particularly expressed in particular with the wor@@ rying envel@@ ope - when older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations in order to protect the elec@@ toral system , including the fo@@ als to prove the identity
in his report it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as proof has been indic@@ ted that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercis@@ ed , especially women and young people , in order to vote in accordance with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or ban@@ qu@@ en@@ ian background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions such a result could be ignored , due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; survi@@ ving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said 50 recommendations in order to protect the system , including the ban that political activ@@ ates works , to stop &quot; re@@ ap . &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also demands tough@@ er registration instructions in order to prevent the election directory to Im@@ migrants and social @-@ guided tours is used .
options should be considered ahead of the election according to your reference to ask .
un@@ remote Tin@@ te can use a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent that anyone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic verification of the nation@@ ality of a person to make sure they are either justified .
a three @-@ year limitation to applications for automatic envel@@ ope .
pro@@ hibition that political activists are able to deal with complete letter and fail@@ ures .
the police give the authority to inst@@ aller out of elec@@ toral stations .
a law modification that facilit@@ ates an indic@@ t@@ ment for inti@@ mid@@ ation under the Rep@@ res@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Law 1983 ) .
photo@@ ch@@ eries in multi @-@ gy@@ ms .
requirement that only English can be used in the elec@@ toral stations ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees rule to en@@ force that voters alone go into the elec@@ toral session .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and is it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower of Ham@@ let certainly did not show a criminal off@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court court has Lut@@ ain , Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for the corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been sufficiently well @-@ known for a number of reasons - according to the high demands in the criminal proceedings - guilty .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ controls &quot; of the V@@ H@@ ouses of the V@@ H@@ ouses .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the tri@@ bun@@ al part of Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal .
our country as the mother of parli@@ aments has a proud legacy , but the wor@@ rying and spread @-@ spread spread of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .

fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are released this week about the French Rad@@ sport Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Prev@@ ot , out of the edge and band who turned out to be an impressive figure in the heart of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year Olympi@@ ans in this summer is by far not the only one to res@@ ist Gold fier@@ ce ath@@ l@@ ete who dis@@ ks up his own famous dou@@ bles - at least not when you can give faith to the social media .
to hon@@ ors the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are facing our scre@@ ens wor@@ ms , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists to Olympi@@ oni@@ cles , which have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with s@@ ands and sur@@ rendered .
the h@@ unters and the Wolf : team member of the US team in Archery Br@@ ady El@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
except for motor@@ cycl@@ ist on the bike @-@ road many people on the Internet are pointed out , such as a certain bow@@ ar@@ ship of the Zw@@ illing of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio might be .
the team member of the US team in Archery Br@@ ady el@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after images , on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ holy .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave to that he has already heard of his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see any great simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; said Br@@ ady of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I looked at it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be at the center : the sincer@@ ely simil@@ arity between the British Weit@@ z@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes , is supposed to go through as a double @-@ predecessor for the Cub@@ an American singer in Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer is compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .

another continued comparison has been drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who displays similar ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver med@@ alli@@ sts in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ onde hair@@ s like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d , while the American Nathan was att@@ est@@ ed Adrian von fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;

theory placed in the room : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple perhaps
a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in stated their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carp@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the American soccer band Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Carp@@ enter an incredibly similar facial form and eyes .

on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald in the show and tried to justify his remark by having said that it was not his intention that it is designed as a personal attack .

buyers in Pri@@ mark emp@@ athy more than Ms , who tried in the shop under@@ go under@@ wear
the buyer did not know where to see them as a woman pulled up their clothes in the midst of a pri@@ eve to try under@@ p@@ ants .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she mu@@ stered the way she went out and laid it back into the shelf .
she moved on and tried four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , an .

a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she went back and left the shop without having to buy something . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the shelf @-@ floor , she took a pair of sub@@ tro@@ users from the position , pulled up its own tor@@ so as well as p@@ ants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tried not even to find a more discreet place to do it - they just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each rigi@@ d when she re @-@ pointed the under@@ p@@ ants that you obviously had@@ n &apos;t fallen into the v@@ aul@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she reiter@@ ated the same with three other under@@ p@@ ants before she decided that her did not fell , and went down again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she seemed to not distur@@ b that she watched someone - or about the person who would buy the under@@ p@@ ants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 who lived in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how to bear in mind that someone would ex@@ h@@ osen up with home who had a different person and have not been washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
Mrs Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; as I get involved , the employees tried to pull the clothing pieces from the sale after she went - what is just as good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of sub@@ p@@ ants to go home and find out that another woman had it and returned , and they were not washed off . &quot;

then strike it with the knee in the bar and twi@@ sting you , while the att@@ acker is scr@@ at@@ ched from pain , the gun out of his hands . beat him down with the course and move back@@ wards while they set the weapon on it .
near Att@@ ach@@ ers who approach himself from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the touch line , gra@@ b the gun and twi@@ sting them , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot .
shift at the same time the weight to the weapon and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the gun out of his grip before they move back@@ wards and set the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?

travel Ian W@@ right H@@ ad for a guide about his tongue on the nar@@ ro@@ est places of Europe
a British passport under@@ lined its immune system and wor@@ ms in a serious test - by spec@@ kl@@ ed some of the most nar@@ ro@@ est and ar@@ rest places of Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel au@@ tor Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k scr@@ apped his course on a euro Sch@@ ein , a gel at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a dishwasher , a tension toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resi@@ li@@ ence of his immune system .
in front of the fl@@ akes of each object he used a L@@ umin@@ re to show themselves and to us what it is to be settled .
but the experiment , which was fil@@ med under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; bringing some amazing results to day@@ light .
the thought , the ins@@ ing of a draw toilet , which was already used by thousands of others , may be totally rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke with physicians and medical specialists about the promotion of bow@@ el bacteria , as well as his own health .
fortunately , nothing left out of what he spec@@ kl@@ ed , more than a bad fo@@ ret@@ aste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resi@@ li@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by jour@@ ne@@ ying through the world and to eat pecu@@ liar as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations to r@@ amp@@ p of toilets , the task presented his immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he told , &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned what my health concerns and I have put all kinds of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud . &quot;
in the film he was sure to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused , was a dirt public toilet in Russia .
his sam@@ pling showed a L@@ umin@@ ometer value of over 4000 units .
as a result the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ers is fresh@@ ly weigh@@ ted hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to ref@@ rain , after their L@@ umin@@ ometer value over 4000 units was , while fresh@@ ly washed hands of less than 60
Mr W@@ right and Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the Reis@@ ef@@ il@@ m &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacter@@ i@@ ths in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This comes the worst thing that I have found in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I will do nothing here because it is here inside .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company , Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new .
something which is fascinating to look at and at the same time explained the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we led to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that ended we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luke us Ian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global one
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in the gut &apos;s health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direction of the film , added : &quot; let me tell me so - I would have spent my respect for Ian when he told him to le@@ aks , just like the ep@@ ic Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course , there were things in which it was easier to get Ian , to touch them and others , with which this was quite difficult .
I am glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot;
in one of these survey conducted survey conducted in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents rep@@ ub@@ l@@ actic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 per cent said that they have at least occasionally use products that included lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us bacteria .

Tanya Skel@@ by and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ bil@@ cock were cast after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after ev@@ acu@@ ated by force from her estate , sho@@ cked inst@@ ated employees of residence the property in a irre@@ par@@ able condition .
the walls being w@@ aff@@ lic@@ ated holes on , wooden sm@@ iles were re @-@ arranged , gar@@ bage was disp@@ ersed on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was decorated to the walls .
the family have been re@@ vered and it is thought that she is now living in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ ably , who works for the management board at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that she was afraid that the apartment is no longer to be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people do not need to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is thought to be considered as not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ ori@@ ous and her reputation is also as well .
the pair had three sons who had been in the apartment , and the police said that the terror , who had inf@@ lic@@ ted the family , we@@ ed we@@ ed with bas@@ eb@@ es , inti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drugs , drugs , and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ ps and flo@@ ods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the le@@ ase , got in June an arrangement for studying the behavior .
in some rooms of the house which will be demol@@ ished under circumstances , old ru@@ bb@@ ish was found
they were trad@@ ed in the property in which had been trad@@ ed in the past drugs , the wood @-@ ri@@ mp@@ s photograph@@ ed .
neighbours said that they first saw them on the streets and regularly ph@@ oned the police .
Corn@@ wall jum@@ pers them and their partners this week for@@ ci@@ fy them by the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to volunte@@ ered .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ val have been received from facilit@@ ated neighbours that told her life to hell .
one said , &quot; They were sho@@ cked on anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless occasions we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used !
now , where they are finally away , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it had a family to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house , which was called the police in regular intervals , 20 years long .
on the over@@ grown side of the church house were ru@@ bb@@ ish and old toys were thrown out .
he added : &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that ten@@ ants administ@@ ered every responsibility for their behavior and family , as a Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ver is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing is taking into consideration .
this was a very difficult case , as the behavior was extreme and their deeds had to be aw@@ ful for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have gone to us and have given us the information to have done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will be con@@ sol@@ dered a few neighbours and con@@ veys the message that ant@@ iso@@ ci@@ ary behavior will not be toler@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons have lived at different times in the house , but they all were over 20 .

they claimed that money was sk@@ elet@@ on for a gra@@ vest@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , which came in 2013 with an automobile accident .
after having been without ob@@ d@@ ach , she assumed that Tanya and her partner is now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ymouth .
lots of room in the house were covered with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will tri@@ umph over the ten@@ ants who will not adhere to the house@@ order
Angela C@@ row is shared by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ver have a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not adhere to the land@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can accept itself without self @-@ dict@@ ation as well as those who were damaged by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and social behaviour , continuing to cooperate with partners in order to protect our communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump tri@@ ple@@ t ″ Pos@@ sibility problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US @-@ Republi@@ can was pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally con@@ serv@@ atives federal states to meet their majority .
President of the Commissioner Donald Tr@@ ump has now taken weaknesses of his election campaign in the recent Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Ut@@ ah .
a rare moment , in which usually large sp@@ uri@@ g and self @-@ confident m@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire is something like concerns vo@@ iced , such as correspon@@ dents .
after having thrown out 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp of the race , now it grows a doubt about its success in the struggle for the White House .
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Ut@@ ah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ ik@@ al Christian , which he asked for assistance in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
debt be false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he took up his well @-@ known medi@@ ans .
Republi@@ can Hoch@@ bur@@ gen w@@ ack@@ les
Ut@@ ah is usually a safe bank for the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans .
a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ or from June , Tr@@ ump and his Con@@ scientious Obj@@ ectors have been profitable by Democrats , Clinton , Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that are common for Republi@@ can candidates in the Federal State .
as endangered in Arizona and Georgia .
in an interview at the CN@@ BC em@@ ump into the question of how he wants to stop again Clin@@ tons at Clin@@ tons : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
and if afterwards : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he do nothing else than to tell the truth . &quot;
if it did not reach it for him at the end for the reasons of political correctness , whether it is fine , did Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to the press studies the party should have threatened , funds to support his election campaign , it should not be able to present any better correspondence values .
instead of what one wants to get the candidates of the Republi@@ can to Congress more strongly among the arms .

this was the team guidance of Kenya has been reported by the d@@ oping @-@ control .
the World Association IAAF did the IO@@ C to receive information about the case , in order to strict his own investigations , shared a IAAF World Spe@@ aker .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IO@@ C , the IAAF World Challenge will be made , &quot; it was in a IAAF statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the d@@ oping control station and got himself as a F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the sample was handed down and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Ken@@ ias Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p so@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the ac@@ cred@@ itation of athletes , who stood on the list for training inspec@@ tions of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .

in the announcement of the IO@@ C set up more than 2000 D@@ oping @-@ target controls before the Rio games it was previously noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into Vis@@ ier .
the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had done much pressure on African country before the summer , an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before Olympia @-@ Start .
as a consequence , W@@ ada Kenya took on the list of countries whose d@@ oping are against the rules of the W@@ ada .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the Ath@@ ath@@ l@@ ated of the country is the most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of television reports , the ARD have been raised again and again , that in Kenya d@@ oping media are readily available and there will be a considerable ment@@ ality of the sport @-@ praying .

a Musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins master@@ piece .
his artistic leadership , Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical in the temple of classical music , and filled with the role of Mary a youth mare .
in Orch@@ ester@@ bury the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ avo Dud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms .
we always say that they are influenced by Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients within their pace and mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have amber music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays a col@@ oni@@ fied Maria .
she is reminded of melan@@ chol@@ y about her love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first because it is musi@@ cally unusual !
and then there was Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says it in her song , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel Pret@@ ty , oh so Pret@@ ty , I feel Pret@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passi@@ on@@ ately .
&quot; she res@@ embles me very , my Italian character , which I as a Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
Dud@@ amel is full of the Lob@@ o for the oper@@ vessel : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so an honor to work with her .
it is a tremendous musician .
and Bart@@ oli is the compli@@ ment back : &quot; Dud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
rigi@@ d is for him a necessity .
you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a more southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is all very important !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip World Cup . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this piece , it is about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we took the refugees , then the Pu@@ ik@@ ans have gone to New York and the New York &apos;s inhabitants did not want to have them .
they are the same issues , and they are as meaningful today as they were at that time .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundreds of thousands &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the hard work of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish municipality of Germany expects a mass @-@ turn to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at short notice , I reck@@ on with ten thousand , medium @-@ term , with several hundreds of thousands of refugees from Turkey in Germany , if the Erd@@ og@@ an regime continues to fighting minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government has passed over several months to cur@@ ate high war@@ fare with pris@@ als , be 500@@ ,000 Kurds in Turkey on the run .
after the ver@@ tically put@@ sch ste@@ men , even sec@@ ular and oppos@@ ition@@ aly ethnic Tur@@ ks .
many will want to start new in Europe if they are continuing to be oppressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state , who himself res@@ ist refugees in their own country refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association l@@ ament@@ ed the deliber@@ ate an@@ ett@@ lement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in eastern cities .
in this way Erd@@ og@@ an wants to raise the exit on the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armenia and Greeks have been exter@@ min@@ ated or driven out over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also the CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President called for the government to be sharp and positioned in Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and its supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also in Germany find a &quot; Hex@@ e@@ jag@@ d &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an @-@ critics .
I do not feel secure in Germany for the first time during the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len Movement also feared the escape of many towers abroad .
more Tur@@ ks are looking for asylum in Germany , mainly Kurds and Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ ists .
the fire @-@ mark@@ ings as a Gü@@ len @-@ trailer are destroyed by teachers and other academ@@ ics of his professional existence .
&quot; who@@ ever does not adap@@ ts and Erd@@ og@@ an is sitting on pack@@ eted caffeine , inci@@ dentally , the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ ari@@ sts , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ oriented foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; world . &quot;
like the newspaper , as the newspaper reported on the numbers of the Federal Ministry of Finance , the Tur@@ ks in front of the coup are faced with the greatest group of political persecution and asylum entitled to Germany .
on June 30 , this is 11.@@ 386 people and therefore under 29 per cent of all as asylum entitled ( 39.@@ 625 ) .
in this survey , not the before war , poverty or fu@@ tility means wage .
asylum entitled to the Basic Law are exclusively political , therefore , from state side , individually and followed .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go , where it w@@ eh@@ oods &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get any of the summer election campaign with - and the holiday makers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia must not choose the country @-@ day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
in 2021 the country @-@ elections will not be held once again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner of Parliament decided already at the beginning of the year .
for it is as yet so far it is not : summer holidays , heat and gr@@ ass@@ roots . this is happening .
the locals who are to be convinced by the voting members are on vacation .
the most vac@@ ation@@ ers that are in the country , on Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so may not choose the country .
to do this , practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the post@@ ers lo@@ bb@@ les , ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers can be distributed and ex@@ amp@@ ed at the end of the voices , just lab@@ ori@@ ous less lab@@ ori@@ ous .
until the 4th of September 2016 , the elec@@ toral and the last holiday season , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has yet to come forward with an election campaign just under the people .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of the SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , now lies in surveys clearly behind the CD@@ U .
thr@@ illing is thr@@ ills , how strong ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ ro@@ ses and what remains at the end of ko@@ al@@ ition@@ ing .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous campaign meant to be seen by his grandfather .
he travelled through the country , distributed ro@@ ses and plau@@ si@@ mm@@ ets a little with the people , just as it was already his legendary running ancest@@ or predecessor Ring@@ storff .
otherwise he has got sea @-@ old feet and gives ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel the debt of the bl@@ os@@ som@@ ing of Af@@ for@@ ging .
their refugee policy , you &quot; We create the &quot; I have acceler@@ ated the rise of right @-@ sp@@ ying what is going to cost it right now .
the CD@@ U with their pro@@ sp@@ itz@@ enk@@ andi@@ daten , the Interior of Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , if you are at the wrong place at the right place .
she has invited two ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel to grand@@ mother ; Merkel Bundest@@ ag@@ sw@@ ahl@@ sk is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not match it , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Vorpommern .
&quot; there was probably the majority in other Länder , &quot; accused Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the NDR .
but it is a shame not to listen to anyone from the corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U reno@@ un@@ ces largely to the usual election campaigns at market locations and in front of shopping centres with umbre@@ llas and air ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , as well as Kok@@ on , play only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inf@@ eri@@ or role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the Union has noticed that you see the base away on the country , that it has to go very hard to find a wire to the people again .
it is no matter how the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any situation in the sides of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U elec@@ tor@@ ate Kok@@ on to his comrades is also self @-@ reve@@ aling : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have to go to where it w@@ ns , namely when people are : Dor@@ it@@ este , Gol@@ dene weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because there is a great deal at stake , cel@@ ery has now called for a particularly committed elec@@ toral campaign .
in surveys , the S &amp; Ds are recently signed with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just below the after@@ ward ( 19 ) .
at the end of 2011 the SPD had become clear to 35.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small part@@ ing with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , should be allowed to create the leap into the day of land .
they are doing a modern virtu@@ e from the holidays in need and put it up in their election in the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Landes@@ chairman Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise green choice of choice went to track @-@ looking for native m@@ oods among the tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the Sp@@ its@@ enk@@ andi@@ dat@@ in , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at by the Mecklenburg @-@ German lakes and finds it also nice .
your impression : &quot; election holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rel@@ ation : Gast@@ sta@@ etten in Chor@@ ale
at the speed , with which the B 27 is re@@ constructed , there is nothing to complain about .
for the persons in the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and only end up until 8 pm , there is a short@@ com@@ prise praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all of the things were pretty qu@@ ack@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet gas station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no default .
the job@@ site could be released on the weekend for half @-@ time planning stages to the South , until the end of October everything will be ready .
gel@@ ob@@ t is also the ab@@ rog@@ ation of the persons responsible for the construction work , e.g. when it comes to setting vessels .
since the construction site on Monday to the south , and also the block@@ age of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in Of@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted , and therefore the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg also exists , the traffic situation inside the place relaxed .
the citizens can now drive from Of@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again .
the footh@@ old of the place seems to be returned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the main management of the executive director of the refurb@@ ishment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephen King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of Bach@@ den@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ nerst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sever@@ ing are examined and rather familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age .
what led to us to find man@@ e @-@ car in housing areas .
as also the speeds are not met , the municipality increased to the measuring vehicle from mal@@ icious .
&quot; there were significant cross@@ ings , &quot; says King , who himself made himself on the location on the spot .
there are two to three per minute have been suffered .
the fastest was with 77 time kilometers in the tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site is further , it was qui@@ eter .
for the busin@@ ess@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that the road is open again for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg .
in the cards you do not wish to have their busin@@ ess@@ men .
but that the B 27 @-@ s@@ ation has led to them in sales , let each one asks you to look through .
however , some more and some are less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thus produced for other companies , for whom the renov@@ ations have little consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the Auto@@ haus Gre@@ er speaking Thomas Sul@@ z from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum light decline , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also that of course is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pro@@ ge@@ ance is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trail along the strongest are the locations along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , holder of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , can find clear words .
this is already existence @-@ threatening .
not only him , but all the hosts have made it hard . &quot;
it was missing the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we need to be glad about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales sur@@ vey@@ ed up sales to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road @-@ up took its operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
half of his staff have to be released .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dism@@ issed , the policy would have responded differently .
instead , government President Jörg Schmidt on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether it could give a financial compensation , the guest care also benef@@ ited from the advantages of the location at the B 27 . now they also have the dis@@ advantages that result in restoration .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties where such have been handled with funding .
with all charges , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his guest will continue to pass .
finally , the family business is located since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history of history .
that other regular cust@@ um@@ ers now because of the complicated levels of traffic conditions can be un@@ challenged , he can compreh@@ end .
if you can not go her@@ go , it is also elsewhere .
that his tribe left again after the end of the re@@ development work , G@@ öh@@ ner does not have doubts .
despite crises with B@@ SE and Bo@@ emia G@@ öh@@ ner stops the effects of B 27 construction works on his cust@@ ody for the biggest crisis , which has experienced its guest care in its long standing history .
six months building work is already brutal .
permanently , in the name of the terrorist attacks on laws is being rob@@ bed .
after the recent attacks , Interior de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick safety package .
but what does a urge to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ al@@ ition@@ ists say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is the En@@ öh@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are reasonable for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political ition@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Federal Minister for his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not transfer anyone .
others , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
also involved in sharing me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Minister of Interior , however , he was located on results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commercial consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the latest attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère he had a little time hidden before it presents his conclusions for safety in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
a lot has already been known to announce that a new security authority is supposed to be responsible for the cr@@ acking , is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany has to apply multiple EU guidelines to passengers and weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for the safety authorities is not yet surprising .
at the part of the Mai@@ zi@@ ère , Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second call for proposals which has not yet been planned with the SPD : he wants to face sympath@@ ises for terrorist groups among punishment and ji@@ ha@@ dists by double citi@@ zenship , with double citi@@ zenship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be tough points for the SPD &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; recogni@@ zes the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he still consider this to be reasonable and ask nothing , which doesn &apos;t already have a chance at the body party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few new ideas presents de Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
they are in part in himself : he is planning quick @-@ plans for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ention of people from deport@@ ation .
refugees who are now being picked up into the country , ought to leave their smartphones and reveal social media accounts for a security examination .
if asylum seek@@ ers for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to im@@ pose some even worse than until now - such as those who mark criminal off@@ ences or imagine their papers to sne@@ ak their identity .
some of them is politically and legally hei@@ gh@@ tened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man@@ ches also works un@@ po@@ res and can be answered questions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of thought for example - raises the question : what does this have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to put in speech , that the attacks from Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees were arrested .
in addition , many people are worried about the high refugee figures concerned about safety .
and things that the people are deeply concerned , they left not in elec@@ toral times even in election campaigns .
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the locking @-@ assurance is great .
and yes , there are freedom of campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU and SPD will therefore lead increasingly in position on the internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few days there was a high time between the two parties .
only a Bulgarian conflict on the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a safety @-@ related ideas @-@ collection of some Uni@@ ons @-@ interior ministers , in which the resort @-@ chiefs will also call a Bur@@ ka ban and a conversion from the double citi@@ zenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère pain@@ t is also here to irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able tones .
from a distance of a double pass , he is not holding anything .
we have fenced the discussion in Germany .
they new to make up , be not useful .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he found constitutional concerns .
whether his own package is stun@@ ned at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the co@@ al@@ ition@@ ists , it has only yet to be revealed .
there is a lot of things that could lead to contro@@ vers@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ voke themselves on the issue of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ is@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled only cau@@ ti@@ ous talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
still today Volkswagen g@@ lim@@ p is coming through .
despite diesel fuel , the pay@@ able data is rising worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs around .
in the recall campaign , there is a s@@ lic@@ ant about a term .
Volkswagen starts for the deliveries to the second half @-@ year .
at the present time , the biggest au@@ gro@@ wer can move in the past year despite its many brands and some well @-@ moving markets further to a plus .
but in July , the nuclear mar@@ ke was weak@@ ened , especially in Western Europe and therefore again charged the total sales , as that was author@@ ised in the D@@ ax .
worldwide , the brand VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1,8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe alone , on to China the second most important market , sales of 14 per cent below the previous year &apos;s month .
in the home market Germany , the excav@@ ations supplied by nearly one sixth .
brand Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ est figures in July primarily on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , it has given it in several key markets by &quot; changing economic conditions &quot; a department of purchase .
apart from the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote was also deb@@ ited from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the U.S. , where the g@@ asi@@ ter were first escal@@ ated , is also continuing to raise a minus .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected account of the Lower Saxony is in@@ compar@@ ably worse by the Dies@@ el@@ sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only a model of 0.9 percent to 3.6 million vehicles .
consolidated Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance a sales point from January to July .
1,3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software check @-@ in .
alone in Germany VW about 2.5 million cars calls for conversion to the workshops .
in the course of the re @-@ change , VW , that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the change of the vehicles , it will give no notice of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or motor power . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the car@@ makers present the client following a &quot; guarantee bond &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as it says on Friday in a company name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal gr@@ aci@@ ousness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; focus &quot; was reported to Volkswagen waters of its German customers now even a guarantee of sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ate diesel models .
these were confirmed on the last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Department .
the Ministry of Transport has been confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully met the development of my investigation and the KBA Commission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; der@@ og@@ ations of this will not be accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said state Transport Alexander Dobr@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or motor performance after conversion are not wed@@ ges and all type @-@ approved types will remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was meant to be a company name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen makes the opportunity to have customers for example a half year after conversion , around with a motor vehicle - and this could result in the new software , even if the damage does not have anything to do with it .
even in the customer interest it is important to avoid that it is in case of mis@@ ai@@ ds other damage , which at all have nothing to do with the ab@@ y@@ ass@@ ky sc@@ andal , to ensure protection with regard to possible guarantees of guarant@@ y as it meant .
therefore , I use VW the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see requests from rich spar@@ ing in future criminal proceedings - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chief of Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on gyp@@ sy or day@@ time accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Federal Federation Deutscher banks talks about an individual case and doesn &apos;t see this a signal : normal parag@@ us would have to be &quot; unable to pay for their &quot; austerity &quot; forces . &quot;
refugee banks money over night in the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay to its 0,4 percent pris@@ ons .
this fee demands the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund ab September from the private and corporate clients for deposits of 100,000 euros on gyp@@ sy or day@@ time accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euro are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs $ 400 in the year , &quot; said Paul .
he had been 40 million Euros for more than 40 million euros , which could be taken from one day to the other and which he could not de@@ valu@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and also cause 0,4 % cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie for any million Euro 4000 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost he continues after the perpet@@ rators now .
the cash just lie in the Tres@@ ors of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four cases , I don &apos;t like the fifth place , &quot; said the bank@@ note .
most of the customers have had understanding and alter@@ ations on other plant forms .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative in Bavaria said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme yel@@ in@@ political course of the ECB is causing a significant costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be easy to wear alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operational permanently is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have raised their fees for account management , credit cards or re@@ mitt@@ ances .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cliff , which is equipped with property a little supp@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank if it is free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; many things I purchase , are released from the late &apos; 60s , early 70@@ ies , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably was doing something to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agre@@ es that those who are buying panels are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend their time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray also believes that many customers he meets to apply to the You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s Profile .
but he also has noticed a new wave of people who have heard of the Medi@@ af@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and promp@@ ted them to buy their old records .
of the conversations that I have led , guys are usually done so about 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers who bought their records to buy CDs now , sell their CDs to restore your boards , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of a postpon@@ ement of a certain age .
but what about the alle@@ ged emotional value of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offers a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some turn@@ fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw himself to the stability of trusted sound machines , of objects , the bl@@ iss@@ ful student .
&quot; I think it sometimes can be the col@@ t of a void or poss@@ essions of material poss@@ essions than a type of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
this is the case with me as collectors , and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to get spiritual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a co @-@ worker from a records stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record in the last month they have not been heard .
the survey took also out that 41 % possess a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who own a record , no record player .
at this time of the message I would probably look very concerned while I bl@@ unt through a st@@ acks in Bossa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onny , 42 , the at sounds of the Universe ( MS@@ W : three men &apos;s middle age ) works , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the realization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone only came here recently here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not get a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ al ton sound , so that I can put them into a shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a large percentage but it &apos;s definitely going to happen .
more products @-@ reli@@ ably , less mus@@ cl@@ ous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those are younger people , not older ones that are only slow to come .
F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated to the Pl@@ ates almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I re@@ ro@@ e .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teenage boys and women middle aged .
even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above listed shops - Wild Be@@ asts neu@@ ester synth@@ esizer and sex@@ be@@ packing pop instead of experimental jazz penet@@ r@@ ently from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks s@@ onder@@ ant lon@@ ely , but nag@@ ging psychological trau@@ mas are difficult to determine if one stands next to someone 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the shop for some minutes and considers the variation of the plates available .
it rather makes a sho@@ vels more than a large one .
it does not earn much , so the collecting of panels is not a real option , she says .
it costs much .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from one computer or another , but the beauty of hard drives is ... it is driving with a lover ?
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
my last stop is a shop , by which is said that a new generation of record ke@@ e@@ pers shall have inspired : urban out@@ fit .
while I give the gift to Je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants to Mu@@ sters , I observe a group of young teenagers , who are group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking of buying a cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Ad@@ ele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at it - maybe because they are only clean decoration , some so far above that it is impossible to touch it .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry , and some customers could send to the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain about .
there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research inquiries made that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they do , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record value , which exist in reality , record stores and in On@@ line@@ for@@ en .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday mor@@ nings with security , not with the stroll through records from Ber@@ wick Street and the leaf through records , while taking the rigi@@ d view of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year false moder@@ ator , who spoke about the shoulders of low age @-@ aged men .

French Court rests on demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle of refugee camps .
a French Court has rejected a offer of the authorities in Calais . do@@ zens of pro@@ visional stores and restaurants in the jungle of Calais to live in the thousands of refugees living down .
during a trial proceedings , this week argu@@ ed that the state should be termin@@ ated to offer 72 provis@@ or@@ ical shops to sell in those individuals within the bearing goods , from cigar@@ ettes to end@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hairdres@@ ser services or produce tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 pt@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ visional restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture , argu@@ ed that these places should be crus@@ hed out because they would be a parallel economy , out of which no taxes would be paid and that a fire@@ man and s@@ cent@@ ri@@ ors were .
humanitarian groups offered the court agreed that stores and restaurants are important , as the free meals that are offered by the state supported union and other groups , not enough food for the growing numbers in stock .
they also led out that the pro@@ visional business and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who run the 72 provis@@ or@@ ical businesses , but ad@@ mits that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Calais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were absolutely understandable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just live people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas will offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the tie @-@ up was the young Book Kids &apos; Café des Lag@@ ers , the non @-@ profit organization and 200 meals a day , English and French style as well as advice on asylum seek@@ ers for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the pet@@ ition to protect the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this children would be a catastrophe for the youngest eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
Germany Ras@@ er must adjust to the next generation of speed measurements : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which are to lead to the tem@@ pe@@ ers especially effectively .
the fut@@ urist@@ ic real En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , to motorway buildings or to san@@ itation bridges with temporary themes , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure there with a stationary B@@ lit@@ zer to ensure a speed limit .
a lasting mobile construction can however be too dangerous or consuming .
the En@@ forcement trailer is aut@@ ark : his battery keeps on un@@ interrupted measuring operation five days , the par@@ ched data is encryp@@ ted via a mo@@ dem .
laser Mes@@ stechnik can also be recorded simultaneously across several tracks across multiple tracks .
variable speed b@@ umps , as well as di@@ arr@@ ho@@ es to time , travel stri@@ ps and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in high @-@ priced state , it is possible to move the trailer according to producers with each car with a cl@@ ut@@ ch cl@@ ut@@ ch .
so that he is not easy to cut , he is lo@@ wer@@ ed in the measuring process , so that the wheels in the pan@@ r@@ ots and inci@@ dentally disappear also a nut@@ rac@@ ed swe@@ ar .
furthermore , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the B@@ lit@@ zer against destruction .
since 2015 the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic information in various Länder . this is now also used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign authorities also suffered from the new technology : recently , France has turned 100 pieces of down@@ ward , according to an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
great Britain got silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold receive
the impressive performance of Great Britain in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came in the finals on Thursday evening in the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were awarded a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odoro stage here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji ert@@ rus@@ hed a master class in the handling , Side @-@ Step@@ ping , post @-@ back and ru@@ her power to win gold - her first Olympi@@ am@@ ed@@ aille of any color .
the defeat was promised by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver med@@ al - Great Britain on this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this competition in which they sm@@ ote the New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the B@@ oks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
but irrespective of that Fi@@ ji had taken a 15 @-@ man team in gold form .
it might be a comfort for GB - but it will likely not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow have a gold med@@ al to hang his neck at : Fi@@ j@@ is Chef de Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
Britain had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago it lost under Ryan of each game at the Adel@@ aide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost just one .
this b@@ ck@@ le is w@@ aken , but the progress is amazing .
fi@@ ji began wonderful and left the attacks GB@@ s from fun boun@@ cing .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. in , when you would walk in driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , seen as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner .
with four minutes playing time , Jerry Cl@@ w@@ ai still invited another attack from the right corner , which he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB has hardly taken the ball .
a rag@@ ing rag@@ ing part of Mitchell stops the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa , a third goal , but it did not keep Fi@@ ji on .
in the seventh minute l@@ ete J@@ asa blas@@ ph@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right @-@ hand corner a touch@@ down and it got 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa has added another since the re@@ mor@@ ff and there was still over a minute of play ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ apped by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB Team and rus@@ hed to line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is so as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while I still se@@ eded .
this is the same .
GB resulted in fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and shut the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Jos@@ ue Tu@@ is@@ ova had ran through a brilliant stop@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on started out an attempt for GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for long in favour of Süd@@ se@@ ein@@ sul@@ an , whose fans s@@ angen , flags and d@@ anced on the ble@@ ach@@ ers .
it was not hard to admire the play@@ ful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
M@@ ata V@@ ili@@ ame put the cake with another try in the last seconds .
the Pfi@@ ff ert@@ ön@@ te , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gs up and GB was crus@@ hed in the lawn .
formerly at the day Fi@@ ji Japan had conqu@@ ered in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and sup@@ planted South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match of the race - Great Britain conversion of difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the B@@ oks to the front in the first half , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke the line with a impressive foot work , and sco@@ red a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant del@@ ayed , Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ aside team , ensured the prize - and thus the silver med@@ aille .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through fight with cancer of the trainer for ru@@ sting .
no &quot; &quot; there will be no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gold gold &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than in these games and what is going to be called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the first stroke of the last , 220 hard c@@ ieve , which enter the story , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in its golden moment on the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only the two who were sitting in the boat , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present as they ru@@ ined for the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in a two without tax @-@ wife in a row , the first women in the history of the British Sports who submitted such a scale .
your domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , you have made an un@@ folded use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ es who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which is not reflec@@ ting the way of the tri@@ umph@@ ant to ge@@ ese .
behind each gold in the veins is a batt@@ ali@@ on of lu@@ ct@@ ant hel@@ pers who make the difference and it was no one assistant as the co@@ aches who would not survive at least 30 months ago whether he was diagnosed with cancer than he was diagnosed .
how he said , he is ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , who is oper@@ able and which did it .
if you do not do that , he spreads throughout .
it would have been a rather worse situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had luck that he could be treating early 2014 , outside the season , which had kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that under such circumstances is the correct term .
I needed money , so I had to go better myself again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time , when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it starts .
herds in itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger .
in the in@@ medi@@ oc@@ ability of victory , their first thought of Williams came to form a nerve rac@@ king morning so she tried to talk more than usual and therefore tried to process his own fears .
p@@ anning available as captain in the Royal Ar@@ til@@ l@@ ery Reg@@ iment in an operation in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it repe@@ ats just how much this meant that much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach of the world .
I couldn &apos;t have a better person to coach or want a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost any race over the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up with their opponents .
even during the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark had stopped , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve .
we were very rare at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Helen invited &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important to not let themselves be broken .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to do something great .
we did not want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take a time for one year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that that was my last race .
this would have been too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to conc@@ eive that I am a Olympi@@ as .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
it feels so much better , &quot; she said .

the steel industry became an additional cost of € 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said to the WA@@ Z , there will now be a fundamental task for talks with the European Commission , following talks with competition arena , Mar@@ gre@@ the Vest@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , if an E@@ EG works of 20 percent .
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for independence .
thus the status quo of the previous regulations is largely as@@ cert@@ ained .
particular relevance have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more need to follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of the em@@ ission level , climate and employment targets are weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ Chef Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in Europe , the steel industry has been suffering from over@@ capacity and a significant price for the financial crisis .
last year the situation is more tigh@@ tened , than the world &apos;s largest aircraft figh@@ ter China den@@ ced on the world market in light of the weak@@ ening of domestic demand .
European manufacturers extend Chinese steel @-@ compliant sale dump@@ ing .
during this spring , the situation has a little bit more relaxed .
to the one show the fu@@ ch@@ asing effect on imported oil , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have stopped .
un@@ clear how sustainable the price is reco@@ vering .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp remained careful on Thursday .
finally , the prices were back again rather st@@ agn@@ ant .
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp also wanted to end up closing of individual works at the end .
in the German steel industry , there were around 86@@ 000 people in the end of 2015 .
in July the German steel manufacturers remain careful in spite of rising prices and growing orders .
they produced 3.4 million tonnes well as six percent less cru@@ de than in the prior year period as the economic re@@ unification Steel in the Friday divided .
after a short rise in May , the quantity delivered now back to the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is expected by two percent below the previous year &apos;s previous year .
the association is counting in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with a rising output .
community , spirit , health : singing is doing sen@@ iors good
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp , already her whole life : a young girl she studied in school &apos;s chor@@ us , in the school study she won the festival of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ ings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; sing me - emoti@@ onally and physically , &quot; describes them .
after a sample she feels balanced , cheerful and overall vivi@@ d , she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next door , she does something good in doing her health and mind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for S@@ ingen is the same from several prospects a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ der of the German sen@@ iors .
most sen@@ iors sang in choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ ke .
by regular meetings , sen@@ iors can establish social contacts and maintain .
because often social and family structures solve , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also has Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize themselves to the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ ke .
because these sen@@ iors exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
those who require its lung regularly , that is not so quick in everyday life from the bu@@ ste .
even if it &apos;s about getting the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an ideal hobby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elderly people often have a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz about the German labour @-@ community of the sen@@ iors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , it explains it .
L@@ enz often observed that the singing or hearing of songs in older people have awak@@ ened many memories , often associated with positive emotions of their youth .
by lyrics and especially ho@@ mel@@ o@@ dies , herself denied boarding itself back to long past events .
while singing , the head will also have a special performance requires L@@ enz .
at the same time , to concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and on a pre @-@ given rhythm it is a great cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people who live alone , practice , not just concentrate on yourself .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through the singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ ke .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ esteem is growing through the singing in a choir .
to show themselves : if I am for something for something , I will better and vig@@ il@@ ant beyond me - this experience rein@@ forces .
good reasons to start with the singing , so there is enough .
who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even though he says too little talent to have , betra@@ y L@@ enz .
you do not sing alone - with 50 sin@@ king people who list@@ ens to you , when a tone also goes off ?
looking for the suitable offer have sen@@ iors various choices , says H@@ ac@@ ishers .
sing someone from the acquain@@ t@@ ances in a sen@@ iors , you can easily connect .
many cities also offer over@@ views about the cho@@ irs in the area .
who wants to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ astic choir , can turn directly to the church or the Church .
many elderly people can also be found via the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the internet can ask your family , friends or neighbours to help with the Internet .
who desire has to sing should necessarily connect to a choir , co@@ der H@@ ac@@ der .
singing is doing well and has something fre@@ eing - this applies to every age .
cats react sensitive as cr@@ ater on fri@@ es of the young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which effect the so@@ aps of cat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on adult animals has .
to her surprise the h@@ ew also allowed the males do not cold - however they stopped in contrast to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the arousal of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the children .
they are responding to ten percent faster on lu@@ te of kittens travelling in big emergency , as scientists have found out by the veter@@ an university and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
males do not respond even to the kittens too - but always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evi@@ d@@ ently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly cur@@ ved p@@ ups for the males were either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Biolog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is first authorized in the study , which was published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BMC Evol@@ u@@ tionary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous investigation the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens moved with the ur@@ gency of their aid .
as a total of nine adult men and eight females have been observed from the MH@@ H MH@@ H .
they were picked up for a pack of babies which were taken for three minutes from the worm and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
secondly , they were confronted with scre@@ aming of stronger edges which were additionally raised .
the researchers consider their results despite the small sample @-@ sample for meaningful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who have still no own offspring , re@@ acted to the cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turned faster to be loud@@ speaker when the rod of the very low @-@ reg@@ ained kittens .
this ability may be inn@@ s or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted , &quot; said the Biolog@@ o .
in the past , scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men based on cot@@ s .
too , some studies showed that women have sensitive to inf@@ ants , quite as if they were already mothers or not , reported the Biolog@@ o Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Pod@@ olski attacks with &quot; g@@ ala &quot; in Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ dra@@ r is in Turkey a football @-@ legend .
in Turkey there have been an ar@@ rest warran@@ t against the former Football hook to an Sü@@ l@@ rest warran@@ t .
he will be accused of being member of a terrorist group .
the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey takes place once more important football match .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the chief of the arch@@ ival between settlements in Istanbul and Luke Pod@@ ol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Business as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even when the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the overthrow of July , the government , the everyday life of standardi@@ zation may not be affected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this does not apply to those who are suspic@@ ious of the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup .
there is also no stop before football .
against the former Star@@ k@@ ick@@ er Hak@@ an Sü@@ dra@@ r and introduced the prosec@@ ution for an ar@@ rest warran@@ t .
therefore , a member of the United States living in America is now accused of being member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ks@@ r shall be followers of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is held responsible by the President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an for the coup .
the first of all , it is true for 90 days , although the state of the most Tur@@ ks did not seem to have an effect on the lives of most Tur@@ ks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the n@@ igh@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for ended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erd@@ og@@ an .
most of the fans of the People &apos;s Assembly are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
what the gro@@ s of Tur@@ ks but in view of dramatic experience in history is the strict rejection of military coup .
even even the fans agree , whether you strike the heart of Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or as a sightseeing .
at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; it will be especially clear back on Luke Pod@@ olski .
his sporting value stood the Köl@@ ner in the distr@@ ust season given : with 17 T@@ res and nine styles in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old completed his first game time as Top@@ scor@@ er of his association .
in the end game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he recorded 1 : 0 @-@ victory .
the newspaper &quot; FAN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; che@@ er him : &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he completed the season an excellent way and secured his team to the Pok@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appointing season for the record Master was an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also appeared in the Europe League early .
in the south per Li@@ g , it just got to rank six .
the season was not good .
the Pok@@ al was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we made this and that is the most important &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Pod@@ olski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Col@@ kt@@ as , the game was better .
thanks to Mario G@@ ome@@ z , who has laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 seasons .
that is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year @-@ old .
it had just begun with the AC Florence under the contract and announced to settle G@@ ome@@ z after the coup attempt as far as the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Mario wants to come to us he must say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; quot@@ ed the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ ick@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club@@ house F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to do this , the St@@ ürmer should be ready to fore@@ go on around a third of his to 7.5 million Euros , or@@ one clearly set : &quot; his sal@@ ary with Florence cannot pay . &quot;
despite d@@ oping : these athletes have still medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year Just@@ in Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for di@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
others survived athle@@ tics sle@@ tics , moreover , they are only laugh@@ ing - they are fighting in Rio to medals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic d@@ oping is still the head@@ lines near the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian swi@@ mm@@ ers Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa which compl@@ ained after a d@@ oping @-@ lock its starting right shortly before the games , was bl@@ aded at its start ( 100 metres chest ) mer@@ c@@ il@@ ess and un@@ tu@@ fted .
it was a Scandinavian scenery : with a fixed smile she was standing there in the hall and had prov@@ oked it with her performance .
when it was proof they won &apos;t pick up gold , the audience broke into a hur@@ ricane .
but there are many more athletes , who , despite d@@ oping past during the Olympic Games in Rio to start .
here an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in Ath@@ le@@ tics .
he was already locked two times for di@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his spell the Olympi@@ asi@@ eger from 2004 and ex World Champions even faster than before , he is over 100 m in 9,80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest pul@@ ling of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ erin and si@@ eben@@ fold World Championship in 2010 had to sit a six @-@ month lock , after taking the pain@@ k@@ ill@@ ings of Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after a surgery you have had strong dental pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old turned out .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Disk@@ us / Croatian ) : 2011 was the Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ erin of 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and Europ@@ am@@ eister@@ in from 2010 to 2016 positive on the For@@ bidden stim@@ ul@@ ant @-@ Mittel Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin .
Per@@ ko@@ vic den@@ oun@@ ced the war@@ nings and has been im@@ pris@@ oned for six months .
the four wid@@ est thro@@ ws this year go to the account of the great gold @-@ favor@@ ites .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ger ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing @-@ Olympi@@ asi@@ eger and two @-@ star world master over 400 m , was in 2010 positively tested and 21 months been locked .

I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ zy , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ l@@ ete were detected as many medals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he lost his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ich@@ on his World Cup title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was established nine years later after having been observed with him testosterone d@@ oping . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to provide Olympia @-@ silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ D@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title in 2006 because of testosterone ab@@ uses .
the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille Olympic Games in 2008 received a verdi@@ ct on a verdi@@ ct of the International Sports State .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m it is rank two of the world @-@ list .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km to go , China ) : the world &apos;s world pu@@ pi@@ l and gold mo@@ favorite was first tested in May , but may still start in Rio .
with the 29 year old world Championships were found evidence of taking a toler@@ able dietary supplement , the spar@@ re of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency W@@ ada fell mil@@ de and ran already on 13 July .
Bom@@ ben@@ ds in Thailand - Austri@@ ans inju@@ red - maj@@ er T@@ ote
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand are with the wife in contact , the Spe@@ aker of the State Department , Thomas L@@ öl@@ l , Fri@@ ag@@ as soon .
she suffered injuries and was treated in the hospital , but I have already left this again .
they had their home trip planned for early September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the Holidays island Ph@@ uk@@ et , as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g , and Ch@@ om@@ ir also be the Austrian citizens , be un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also remain in contact with local authorities , so Schn@@ öl@@ l .
at approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok nearby Hu@@ a H@@ in , on Thursday night , two bom@@ bs were explo@@ des .
according to police an Tha@@ il@@ änder@@ in were killed and about 20 people have been inju@@ red , including the Austrian government , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning again two explo@@ sions were high , and according to the authorities another man was killed .
also by ph@@ uk@@ et was reported in the morning a bom@@ bing of bom@@ bs .
in the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular Ba@@ dest@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was viol@@ ated to the police and a taxi driver .
at Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country then explo@@ ded a further bom@@ b , which shi@@ fted an urban forti@@ fication .
the jump was according to the authorities in a cau@@ li@@ flower before the reverse of the coast police in the air .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g in the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he on the southeast coast several break@@ down .
the name of a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ b attacks carry the same manual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said chief Dan@@ ai Crit@@ erium av@@ ee Fri@@ day@@ early in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unless it too early to express yourself to possible mot@@ if@@ s - probably it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks of the attacks , which is typical for the bom@@ bing and Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
however , the Thai police declared the attacks not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead , it is assumed that the bom@@ bs were laid by oppos@@ es of the ruling j@@ unta .
the authorities would have received sec@@ rec@@ y indications in recent days of announ@@ cements in the south of the country - but they don &apos;t have been informed of the exact time and locations .
still be un@@ clear which group behind the attacks put .
the police took its officials from all over the country to enhance security around important government buildings and airports , stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement quarters .
in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ b attacks , but they mostly do not direct them against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the intensive @-@ heart@@ ed bom@@ bing education , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to afford the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in its home page , the instructions of the Thai safety authorities .
high safety risk ( security level 3 ) paid for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani , and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
after disputes between security gu@@ ards and Muslim people , there will be no necessary travel into these provinces .
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday was issued a few days after a controversial referendum on one by the military j@@ unta .
this sp@@ ur@@ ks of the military has a large influence over the years to come .
Jun@@ ta Chef and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said , the bom@@ bs are an attempt to don@@ ate chaos while the country moved towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism .
the j@@ unta , which had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest finds himself good to have led the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military did not have succeeded in getting the rebel@@ lion of Muslim rebel@@ lion for years in the extreme south of the country .
in the conflict there were already more than 6,@@ 500 people killed .
almost one year ago , in Bangkok an attack on a popular Hind@@ u @-@ archipelago was killed , most of them foreign tourists .
it was the blu@@ est attack of the younger history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the Vis@@ or of the federal state of constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several nation@@ ality , the Constitu@@ tion@@ ist also has put the Constitu@@ tional Court in the covenant the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated up @-@ to @-@ date democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitu@@ tional Chef Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ din@@ ed of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the emig@@ rants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ use in more extreme manner .
therefore , we observe the movement now too .
the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active since 2012 in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multi@@ cultural &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass @-@ migration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by over@@ sight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Constitu@@ tional Court in nine Bundes@@ länder - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Th@@ ur@@ in@@ gia - watch the &quot; identity &quot; already .
Ma@@ arten said , his authority was closely aligned with the govern@@ ors .
&quot; groups like the &apos; ident@@ it@@ arian movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; the Constitu@@ tional Treaty .
generally they try extrem@@ ists to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the tat@@ to@@ ed Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ right .
that is not a matter of advertising for your own cause .
the propaganda must speak the people emoti@@ onally .
young people are particularly sus@@ cep@@ tible in a special way .
this is dangerous .
finally , from several federal states , there have been reports of the contacts of &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; to Af@@ D @-@ politicians .
we did so , he did not have a knowledge .
for the constitutional protection of the possible contacts of this species be relevant only from a certain point .
it depends on whether the particular party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals , the extrem@@ ist are extrem@@ istic , changing their goal and thus becomes more extreme .
decisive is therefore , whether such people have a controlling influence on the party .
so this is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the clear increase of military criminal off@@ ences and attack on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps , he did not speak of new right terrorism in this regard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we have observed in recent years that it can provide us@@ or@@ ist structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday Group .
it may well be that further legal group@@ ings or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attack from other far @-@ right mot@@ if@@ s .
however , a nation@@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of rectang@@ le @-@ or@@ ism is however not recogni@@ zable .
the existing groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
concerned , Ma@@ din@@ ate said that many gri@@ ps have entered into the account of people who were not in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ect in attack on asylum seek@@ ers were not previously known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated and supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that were previously occupied with right @-@ wing extre@@ mis@@ ists who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left have chosen to have radic@@ alised by far right @-@ right mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympi@@ oni@@ cles or world records the head@@ line with the Olympic Games .
that shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer play in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics center sw@@ am the slightly out@@ put@@ ted swi@@ mm@@ ers from Ethiopia as slowly that it was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the detail was chosen .
in the social networks , Hab@@ it was then as vir@@ al inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
in fact the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a back@@ distance of 48 seconds got its lead , and won the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was more like his just sports figure , which attracted attention from the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participate in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special start@@ up from the international swimming association .
this will be distributed to make swimming in under @-@ presented countries .
as in Ae@@ ge@@ an , most athletes want to run , having just wanted to do something else .
preparation is everything : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te are ready for the big race .
quickly took the first nickname .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media recorded him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RO@@ BEL of the wh@@ ale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well @-@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ ids &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about him funny . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres of Free style , played no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for medi@@ al attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from the Equ@@ atorial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 metres of free style .
fr@@ en@@ gene@@ tically was launched in M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i .

at an accident of a travel with 43 sen@@ iors in the Ae@@ ge@@ an ( district of Au@@ rich ) , eight people have been inju@@ red .
two of the passengers suffered severe injuries , the police shared with them .
the 66 years old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to stra@@ y their details according to a counter@@ f@@ eit le@@ aster , who drove some of the return on the counter .
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ woman in the police Au@@ rich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus self @-@ employed , &quot; she said .
the fire brig@@ ade liber@@ ated the in@@ m@@ ates .
six life@@ cars and a quart@@ z @-@ cars came to the in@@ genu@@ ort on the Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ conventional travellers were brought back to the Kr@@ umm@@ hör@@ ner district P@@ ew@@ sum .
where they should wait for a spare bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the trucks and potential witnesses to report himself in the police .
the fees for cu@@ bic meters of eff@@ lu@@ ent is from 1 October 2016 for the area of the Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 , instead of 2,10 Euro ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( so far 28 euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( so far 2 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste fee will then be increased once more , if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary .
after a higher level of calcul@@ ating the se@@ wage rate in Az@@ endorf then lie at 4,@@ 37 euros per cu@@ bic meters .
like Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) , was found in the approval of the budget through the country council ? Kul@@ mb@@ ach , found that there are under@@ places for these se@@ wage vessels .
the market Kas@@ endorf was required due to legal basis , to operate machinery for free .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens and the commercial and industrial companies are from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg und Z@@ ult@@ enberg deeper into the pur@@ se .
the ag@@ it@@ ators are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board , Herbert Schmidt was established by the Panel , the re @-@ escal@@ ator of the fees was necessary for the agricultural machinery of the market .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , Over@@ - or cover@@ ings will be equ@@ alled from the previous cal@@ ine period .
the engra@@ ving ha@@ em@@ akers sur@@ founded Schmidt so that it is with all three se@@ wage systems for relatively small facilities with a very low water @-@ waste treatment that lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 Ku@@ bik@@ meter per year .
thus , due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a considerable impact .
moreover , the wast@@ ew@@ ater in all three plants is easily retro@@ fitted .
furthermore , in the backward lim@@ ation period , during all three plants , not least because of its age , the repairs and repair of repairs was shown in a significant extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt asser@@ ted that in the Ab@@ wasser@@ anlage Az@@ endorf had to be replaced the mechanical protection system due to a damage .
in the p@@ umping station which had to over@@ hau@@ led the nearly 20 years old F@@ W@@ CC for nearly 20 years , and in the pond area Lop@@ p has to be installed after nearly 20 years of running the first swe@@ ep in order to keep the water legal requirements even in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the advanced supervis@@ or and maintenance costs were dealt into account accordingly in the new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Calendar period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which is still considerably below the current level in the 2011 / 2012 level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone breaks made clear , that at the small waste water fall in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , supple@@ mented Schmidt , the market share of large sub @-@ security costs have spar@@ ed in the past 20 years .
the situation for the mentioned plants will remain prec@@ arious about quar@@ ry , especially since one could not extend the Supp@@ lies of the Supp@@ lies Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al in order to extend these plants because it is a defic@@ it of defic@@ it .

Snap@@ chat &quot; Anim@@ e &quot; -@@ effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is Anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers argue that it is non@@ ensi@@ ble towards breeds .
with its fil@@ tering tool , Snap@@ chat offers approximately 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with ident@@ ities in such a way that is already bor@@ dered an absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be a painting from a Roy Light .
the filters are distinctive , stand@@ alone tool , which can produce more than 30 million improved spirits per day .
all the tr@@ ams will go to the public .
Snap@@ chat @-@ filters have drawn critic@@ isms in the past , in which they have been accused that the app Black@@ face @-@ face or white skin as beauty ideal .
when this week caused a filter to some users , who gave them sli@@ ce , wrong teeth and aff@@ lic@@ ted che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Gel@@ b@@ face . &quot;
they asked if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
the messages and the rebel@@ lion were widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and mother@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat that it could have been de@@ activated .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as a hom@@ age to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders , the r@@ attle E@@ is@@ sm@@ us have experienced , reminded of the filter of hur@@ ricane c@@ lich@@ és .
others ref@@ ra@@ ined the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American artistic student , whose twe@@ et was widely used about the photos that the filter &quot; hur@@ ting and yellow was annoying . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argu@@ ed with the ju@@ xt@@ apos@@ ition of a very contradic@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not successful , but that the face of the face was drawn into the extreme extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ dr@@ te .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless dialogue and integration of integration , conference rooms up to Hollywood and the equipment we all stop in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who di@@ vers@@ ed in matters of race as their el@@ der counter@@ players - could go more likely to anticip@@ ate sensitivity .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats fil@@ tering a picture creates that for a user is insul@@ ting , &quot; so it is much more difficult that such things was un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product trainer and Ingenieur@@ projekte for medium to delete their Snap@@ chat account and urged others to do the same .
in an attachment for medium and in a telephone interview she said that she fai@@ th@@ es that racial contro@@ vers@@ y had a lack of diversity in the use of Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ized the great part white , only male leaders and ended their up@@ set with a has@@ ht@@ ag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they do not have various represent@@ ations of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese I @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours , which they work there , but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat largely ignored un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures relating to the diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it rejected Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to an intercom , the company has recently focused on a personnel responsible that focuses on re@@ structured population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said that they will be closed their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that that is not o.@@ k@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military execution of adul@@ ter@@ ised ISIS dis@@ cord , displays committee of Congress
military depen@@ dents of the United States Central Command changed radic@@ ally service to record an optim@@ istic image of the war on the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it had allowed the real stat@@ uses of Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by an Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Council of conflict , Secret Services Committee and the Wehr@@ macht , reported on much dis@@ content among Central Command Secret Services analyses , reported on how much its ass@@ essm@@ ents have changed on the American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , in short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military installations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence agencies , which were log@@ ged from high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ ners typically , a more positive picture of the US &apos;s efforts against terrorism could have allowed to have been allowed to have positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quot@@ ed an newspaper article . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened when Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering , if poor analyses to be presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can become a member of the House of Represent@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management card in the Cent@@ Com are enough to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report shows detailed proof of the recent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces .
although there is no direct evidence to show that Government agencies have given instructions to alter the reports , it shows how anal@@ ysts got exposed to the pressure of their lectures , an optim@@ istic image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; during the first half @-@ year 2015 many of the Central Command press releases , opinions and statements made in front of the Congress really more positive than it corresponds to the facts &quot; sur@@ rendered .
for example , a Cent@@ Com had publicly known that a military conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ m could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ sul , the second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , is so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command have changed the following reports to be sent down to the danger of ISIS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ can ri@@ ef@@ en the Task Force in Life after them has been played , analy@@ st used to cope with the mani@@ pulation of reports about the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will still be completed by more detailed findings during the investigations .
additionally , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Chief of Defense at the Ministry of Defence .
the democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published on Thursday their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com arranged an over@@ crowded process for the creation of thought@@ ful decisions regarding IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; gave the highest priority democr@@ at in the commun@@ ee , a member of the Represent@@ atives Adam B. Shi@@ p , in an opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , as Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de@@ ed the publication of thought@@ ful reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complic@@ ates the mor@@ ality under analy@@ st and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave excessive space for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Shi@@ p and Democrats have given no evidence of any hin@@ ts at the White House at the Cent@@ Com analy@@ st with regard to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the congress of Congress was published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Beast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported by the backing of the Pent@@ agon , which were recorded according to complaints from Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ m@@ ite . Patrick Evans , a press spokes@@ person of the Pent@@ agon , gave in an opinion that the Secretary of Defence would not report any reports of Congress , while investig@@ ating the general inspec@@ tor was still underway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have all diver@@ ging opinions with regard to the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and defense ministers have welcomed a contro@@ vers@@ y discussion of these important issues of national defense . &quot;
investig@@ ators have resi@@ dual effects on the question of a successful a@@ erial campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
but the alleg@@ ations of last year however have raised the question that President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest @-@ ordin@@ ations of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crises .
the cr@@ iti@@ que of criticism regarding the Islamic State sp@@ ear@@ ns about the Islamic state at dis@@ ruption of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writing about how the dam@@ aging government under George W. Bush question@@ ed the recommendations of many anal@@ ysts in Iraq and have little time on the wall to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker after st@@ ating government offices , that oppos@@ ing the statements by government bonds had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these pro@@ visional refin@@ ement would have taken place to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , reported the Times in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ n@@ iger commands , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of Leg@@ isl@@ ative due to its over@@ ly positive assessment of the war@@ fare with a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA spends fourth match in the field @-@ ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Britain .
one day after she had launched three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie F@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women at a match for Thursday against India that the Americans with 3 @-@ 0 p@@ ans .
five doors in two games should really present an unforgettable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that have ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I do not belong to people who keep their goals in mind .
however , that knows them : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the ol@@ ymp@@ ic competition and are even@@ ly preserved in their group with the British in the first place , who remain un@@ be@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will encounter two consecutive succ@@ ession on Saturday in the last game .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which of the two teams will gain in the first and second place within their group .
the initial plat@@ inum will last longer a little bit longer from the way that the other group guide .
as always the game may start on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising h@@ ub@@ les by their success story , four years after she landed in the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years in his hands with the ho@@ ckey club ( their two older sisters also played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , which was 16 years ago it was the youngest member in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 as it was not able to qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 in which she and her team went wrong .
in the following year , Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , Trainer of the national team and with it began to turn things for better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a body change , &quot; said B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did not have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Day of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in London we now have . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have completely let the ruin .
on Thursday nights B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the local area .
India was gone without victory in the tournament into the game , but the team showed itself surprisingly strong and kept the player shooting from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter to B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a Sprint with the flat ball through the left side flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and lu@@ str@@ ate the ball into the gate to get an 2 @-@ 0 leadership .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last district .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the go@@ ali@@ ke@@ eper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs that had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the r@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen des Tramp@@ oline
wherever you are , how late it is , they are the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel permanent and in@@ es@@ capable , a rapid run @-@ run between competition and stri@@ ving .
it is as if the ol@@ ymp@@ ic F@@ ack@@ el itself would be a burning rod from the watch@@ strap , for swi@@ mm@@ ers to the gar@@ ner to the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ete .
you can not turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen while listening to your neighbours in qu@@ eue in the coff@@ es@@ hop without having Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and is a female black with cri@@ m@@ ples , would certainly have played among these well @-@ known names that are sent to Prime Time , built up by sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ TV commerci@@ als if he would be a swi@@ mm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts , or even fats .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the ol@@ ymp@@ ic tramp@@ oline for gold .
the ol@@ ymp@@ ic flame does not shine any event equal .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports , which are not commonly recognized : air pist@@ ol , arch@@ ery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest , and may it be long reign .
but if I can clearly make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me direct the attention on the discreet char@@ me of the tramp@@ oline .
although the tramp@@ oline was already a ol@@ ymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was noticed the last 16 years that many people asked , did not know that it is a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art at all .
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the US ath@@ l@@ ete sent to the competition , there has never been a med@@ al in the tramp@@ oline and has had a ath@@ l@@ ete until the end of 2012 .
the Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans to share for the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold med@@ al from London this year .
the tramp@@ oline jump has a certain out@@ sider , partially because it sounds suited for an un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear for a C@@ low@@ ns@@ schule than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , it &apos;s just a little bit enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the car@@ to@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mb@@ ling of his never ben@@ ign bu@@ zz - but also the Grazie of the sne@@ ak and diving , the two sports that combines it essentially .
the word &apos; tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; jumping board . &quot;
emerging winner jump on a gigantic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of dec@@ aying movements ( turning , p@@ ups and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
they are evaluated according to official V@@ apro@@ x after the execution , difficulty level and &apos; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ long athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are in Rio to face each other .
the common ol@@ ymp@@ ic V@@ ektor is almost straight .
med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold faster , faster , upwards and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and back , upwards and down@@ ward at the playground .
they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but in the television transfer also another height of the target : that of the world or the Olympi@@ an ords .
the target @-@ looking stri@@ ves is no@@ bel , ad@@ mi@@ red , even fan@@ atics - and it is enough to tears even a spect@@ ator .
but it is also what I personally feel when looking for these games as something ti@@ ring .
this offers the tramp@@ oline a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the tramp@@ oline @-@ jum@@ per is above .
a down@@ ward movement is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ all@@ t , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes to the top , then down , then ef@@ fort@@ lessly back up .
also here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no w@@ oven into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the Competition can only be with the Olympic Games .
qualifying and En@@ dr@@ unden of women will take place on Friday morning , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; most of the men on Saturday , also around 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will be@@ ate the En@@ dr@@ unden as part of an afternoon @-@ blo@@ c on both days from 14@@ .00 .
in the midst of Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , a which is likely to be over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the awareness raising , only by the ag@@ gre@@ ening and the objecti@@ fication of athletes may be achieved - like it claims the male US Tur@@ ner according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey is expecting his to air rin@@ ks , new fan@@ community .
&quot; a generation protest@@ ed &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a allies of the USA
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators are calling for political changes in Ethiopia , turning the violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that ump@@ y protest@@ ers were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police with s@@ uss@@ ing .
is Ethiopia just going to come together ?
over the last ten years , there has been one of the stabili@@ zes countries in Africa , a solid part of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months the protests against the government sh@@ aken the country and turned into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed to roads and requested fundamental political changes .
the answer of the government was un@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful to human rights organisations .
witnesses gave to that polic@@ emen on two un@@ armed protest@@ ers were p@@ oured and killed .
located in the circulation , sensitive videos about the protests which are pres@@ um@@ ably dated from the last or beginning of this year , show such safety men young people with sho@@ cks , while these were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
the leader of the UN authority for human rights now demands an in@@ coming investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to over@@ head this country and in the future it will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populated land in Africa in Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight against terror over the region particularly in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy exp@@ ands at the cau@@ stic speed .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new comm@@ u@@ res@@ in in the capital Ad@@ dis Abe@@ ba .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Israel was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations , headed the repression through the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , which dis@@ si@@ dents effectively were brought to silence .
many were sent into exile or to prison , killed or killed in the desert of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you press people and don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lec@@ turer at the central Ethiop@@ ian .
the entire youth protest@@ ed .
a generation protest@@ ed .
there are numerous complaints that cover all from the ground @-@ use to the stran@@ gl@@ ehold regarding power of the ruling coalition .
after a further critic@@ ized election last year the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions along the border with Erit@@ rea ; a fight for this jag@@ ged , controversial line in June hundreds of lives .
anal@@ ysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were imposed more or less forced in recent years , the tur@@ mo@@ il and reg@@ ain themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ ching after years of suffering from the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems to be harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years there were a lot of Ethiopia in a position to communicate with the social media as cheap smartphones were becoming more frequent and improved the internet services .
even if the government det@@ ects access to Facebook and Twitter as they are in regular intervals , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies who want to hide from where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave they their way to protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for Ethiopia , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ae@@ ge@@ an , mainly Christian @-@ countries , in politics and the economy , while they are the Oro@@ mos explo@@ ded , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but even this is also changing .
&quot; we are here to coordinate with a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the biggest protests found in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which affects approximately 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in military service , trade and politics .
the third reason for the tur@@ mo@@ il is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel@@ lion of rebel@@ lion , was up to his death in a non @-@ compul@@ sive disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister .
he was regarded as tacti@@ cal genius , a man who could think about its corners .
anal@@ ysts are saying that he was particularly well @-@ vers@@ ed in order to use early signs of dis@@ content and special officers in order to handle opponents and make it det@@ ri@@ mental .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict @-@ analy@@ tic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen relatively un@@ clear reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region of Northern Sardinia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
anal@@ ysts are saying that he does not enjoy the confidence of the controlled safety services rendered by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last time that Ethiopia was living a mo@@ il in 2005 after thousands of elections protest@@ ed , according to the indications provided by analy@@ st the government and subsequently were stolen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the following raid , many protest@@ ers were killed , even though it was less than in recent months and this time of un@@ rest was relatively fast over .
development of experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , as well as the new pop@@ e @-@ train , as well as for their meas@@ urable steps in the poverty ab@@ at@@ ement .
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ art of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
the last month demonstr@@ ators in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ian city , of Tig@@ ray @-@ guided businesses and the hat@@ red against the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more commonly used in social media .
anal@@ ysts are saying that the protests the US and other Western allies can bring into a pecu@@ liar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dr@@ on@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though they are un@@ divided that it closed its base .
while the West wants to support democracy , he does not want his allies in an already vol@@ at@@ il@@ ous area collap@@ sing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gem &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama was founded &quot; Sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday the last contro@@ vers@@ y led by him that his repeated reiter@@ ated statement , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would be the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clar@@ ion bore new questions about the communication skills of the presidential election of the Republi@@ can , whether he would be able to communicate openly with the American public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also brings his comrades , who make an effort to take him during an event@@ ful phase , in the actual position , statements that he could not be meant for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after he had made the demonstration with an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump in relation to the claim on Thursday returned and consisted in interviews that he genuinely didn &apos;t intended to indicate the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in a morning twe@@ et on Friday he said Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ cast@@ ic .
the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the alleg@@ ation totally seriously .
when the conservative radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wants to we@@ aken a little we@@ aken it by reminded him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him , the Republi@@ can candidate wanted nothing of it .
the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t on Mr. Tr@@ ump after , while he tries to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked to speeches for the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump repeatedly tried to return to this topic .
by using Twitter , he was that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would like to make suggestions about higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already taken its defense to its defence .
at the end of July he pointed strong criticism when he said , the Russians should be Mrs. Clin@@ tons ho@@ e , but explained later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bhag@@ avan said the s@@ ark@@ astic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this method allows to post@@ p@@ one Mr. Tr@@ ump @-@ language boundaries in politics and then go back to ruin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages recorded by his fans , how they arrive , and then if necessary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the way the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth West , a communication sex@@ ist who observed the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ agu@@ ely so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of trying to def@@ use the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has still accepted her sound , as its transform@@ ations went further back .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a guided tour with a big advantage in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally tried to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he accused his cr@@ itic frequently to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understood its humor .
but while he is strengthening the focus of the attention in recent months of its presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze has brought his lo@@ y@@ als to stand in the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative may be his statements .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of the most prominent inter@@ c@@ ents to defend their candidates today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , he asked about the accuracy of Mr. Tr@@ umps &apos;s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organisation , he called it Hind@@ er , completely false and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq .
most of the mainstre@@ am Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama was served as an Secretary of Mrs. Clinton as he allowed ISIS to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggressi@@ vely .
in front of the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump will continue his attacks on the media and bow@@ ed them to them on each of his words and to be bi@@ ased toward him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he for@@ h@@ issed the &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts , who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can not ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats sp@@ ott@@ az@@ ed on Mr. Tr@@ umps &apos;s exc@@ use as a further proof that it is un@@ suitable for the presidential guard .
once passed over the price of the market , Café is returned in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a ash@@ amed café in William@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash , which no Wi @-@ Fi had , but for 15 years a good coffee .
naturally , by the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front has been crowded .
the store So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which sat in summer 2014 , sold off so@@ ap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes .
local people saw it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ ous town .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ entation wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea hotel except and ver@@ b is now a so@@ ap @-@ store . &quot;
but when New York change is , then it is also re @-@ finding .
a re@@ vit@@ ate ver@@ b Cafe opened in Green@@ point in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is also still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cis@@ co Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing member of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes .
he began to work with Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when he offered a customer to make money for a new aliens , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , be@@ held much at .
ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the Bag@@ els , the same Esp@@ res@@ ome model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verse .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment .
he carried out new ingredients .
on the menu you stand sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are sheer numbers such as caps and s@@ ass@@ ed oni@@ ons .
there is natural keys .
the café serves no beer anymore , but there is fresh juice .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed a constant stream of old tri@@ bal clients .
&quot; many old customers were also forced out of William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday Rebecca was one such client .
Oliveira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after it was drawn to Green@@ point , she would take the way .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee left @-@ t@@ ines , she said .
&quot; I realized that there was coffee and the culture in the basket I liked it , &quot; she said .
now , they drink coffee , even if they used in place in place of their usual I@@ ced coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ended C@@ hai tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long@@ time and loyal customer since the beginning of the year 2003 .
he went there before work and was inev@@ it@@ ably always the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket , and they prepare my Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients into the menu .
nowadays , Ros@@ enthal can still get his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he won &apos;t wi@@ den that he has taken the so@@ ap in the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie reminds us a special so@@ ap for ver@@ b with the coffee @-@ coloured coffee of the coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go down on her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish citizens have also accepted the café as well .
a new customer translated the menu into the Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he has planned to make them back soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the site also has other advantages .
a local Saf@@ t@@ room wants to fill the coffee @-@ wr@@ inkl@@ ed coffee into the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the cafe exp@@ ands to a nearby building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is sufficient to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was tri@@ bal and said that he was destroyed at the ground than the cafe closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the prayer of the loc@@ ale and the beast seemed to get a new coffee as a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to cra@@ w@@ l , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an extensive meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the presidency , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gour@@ met , president Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took a Fai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fif@@ th Avenue as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water@@ mel@@ tie sou@@ ps .
its menu on this day was something modest : filled eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , Kartoff@@ el@@ p@@ ü@@ ree and as dessert a p@@ au@@ men@@ p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e was added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both grocery .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the USA while Zi@@ egel@@ man told her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
their newest cooperation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in the Har@@ per Verlag illustrated the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter in the Ic@@ ici &apos;s sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , sn@@ app@@ able Imb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District that is already in business since the stock crash in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , converted a fresh cold tap with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with mas@@ hed and vegetable @-@ car@@ ving fun .
when the re@@ por@@ ters he exhibited , this found the couple for a discussion about eating at the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there were Meer@@ n@@ uss@@ bro@@ t , Leb@@ er@@ kä@@ se and Boh@@ nen@@ bro@@ t .
they were made out of an ingredient and some am@@ bit , which stretched the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as an evening meal .
so@@ e gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have placed in the stomach such as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
cre@@ ws of women cooked for male dirt and it became fresh@@ ly b@@ aked Past@@ ete for breakfast , lunch and dinner served .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were Americans who sent food during the first World War in hung@@ ering Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indicates the ways in which the country turned out to be no longer the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ en@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was a time in which food for the Americans was a central , dedicated topic , &quot; built Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
as well as the new Bud@@ di@@ ments : mysterious foods such as bread and bar@@ gains have been to stap@@ le food , the bar@@ gains as &quot; wonderful nature , Es@@ sens@@ ations &quot; forgotten , &quot; mer@@ ed Zi@@ egel@@ man , since cook@@ s could hide infinite ingredients under a kre@@ mi@@ red sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry mort@@ ar .
meat , which was for years the center of the American cuisine was , has become a rare and motivated luxury .
pecu@@ liar compounds has been tried , as a low @-@ cal@@ orie and poor gr@@ ati@@ fication of taste or even healthy kitchen@@ ettes .
while her research for the book that includes recipes , prepared bri@@ cks a dish from that epoch , b@@ aked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was no popular supplement on lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann runs further : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and b@@ aked oni@@ ons do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or ever since fiscal restra@@ ints - including Louise Stan@@ ley , lad@@ ress of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country of such .
by being published by recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to be &quot; budget@@ ary &quot; budget@@ ing such as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ r@@ ots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a celebration of a historic treat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports of the response from the government to star@@ ving citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ C@@ ake @-@ attitude .
while he is publicly the simple I@@ owa peasant @-@ cuisine of its cuisine , it p@@ umped like the milli@@ on@@ th man of the world , to which he has become .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental food like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and carried a sm@@ u@@ king .
he was delightful real@@ ting alien .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt would perhaps have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to stat@@ ute this stomach with his stomach .
as described in the book , the ten@@ ders of a house@@ ke@@ eper had no interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , that the White House caused the boring meal in Washington but also one of the most sought after . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food , has been rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs .
the legacy is based on our ongoing focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science applied to foods .
the couple gave thanks to the writing of the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man in @-@ law has gotten better understood - for example the food could not throw away .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she made people really sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind @-@ exploitation .
after the plates were vac@@ ated by Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and Co@@ e a dessert , which they had cooked at home : the p@@ aving house , the President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt was fun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick , hum@@ bly to send a name to the name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no s@@ lag@@ ged Sah@@ ne , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and c@@ innamon .
each de@@ pl@@ unge , somewhat re@@ lu@@ ct@@ antly re@@ lu@@ ct@@ antly a spo@@ on in the t@@ arian , brown gi@@ b@@ ber .
amazing enough it wasn &apos;t bad .
Co@@ e hol@@ lowed three times a supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in bom@@ bs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he sat down his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ed everything to save the life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old even died with a bom@@ b attack in the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Om@@ ar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil audience , who saved her life according to the picture of the newspaper .
29@@ 00 volunteers are putting their own life on the game to pull people from their bom@@ bs and to make first aid in the war .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
Om@@ ar was the face of the group : a video of a civil servant who shows him in a 11 @-@ hour saving of a cleans@@ ing from the ruins of a house , went in 2014 to the world .
it made the Syri@@ ans for the shining symbol in the gra@@ zing of the war .
but as heroes he never seen himself , said loud , &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die to rescue life , I think that God has in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
just before Om@@ ar &apos;s own attack fell victim , he had spoken in a video of the last bom@@ bing ra@@ ids in Syria .
the Hel@@ ic@@ opter turned 4 ti@@ bom@@ bs over the Al@@ za@@ dia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we remove the toxic remains of the bom@@ b so that they do not play children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quot@@ ed the image of his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bom@@ b of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .

this from lon@@ eliness , but seems to be a pan@@ acea for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science , &quot; in any case by a Green@@ land@@ hai that might be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ ink@@ lein from the Max @-@ Plan@@ ck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life @-@ span that means for vert@@ eb@@ rates a world record .
though , the evolu@@ tion@@ ists had long been pres@@ umed that Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie st@@ ony are .
only missing the evidence .
Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , finally , they live mainly in the ice @-@ sea before the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Green@@ land , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water tem @-@ temperatures around six degrees Celsius , they usually dive at the surface only in winter .
more information about the life styles of the Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie know researchers in accordance with little .
their time @-@ pent@@ agonal ma@@ i@@ ves , when they re@@ medi@@ ed six animals from the top ten animals with a transm@@ itter .
prey make this ha@@ ie nevertheless : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had the j@@ aw of a young ice cream swal@@ lowed .
maybe they chase them as@@ le@@ ep animals or pat@@ rolling at the bottom of the iron and look car@@ c@@ asses , which tor@@ ate from higher water layers down to the bottom .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now studied 28 Green@@ land@@ routes , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 Green@@ land or S@@ val@@ bard as a ding@@ y out of the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was only 81 cm long , while the largest 5@@ 02 centi@@ meters .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lin@@ sen@@ core of shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ method .
this centre of the ey@@ eli@@ ds occurs already before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained in it later are no longer renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ sen@@ head .
its birth should therefore lie after the early 19@@ 70s as an atomic arm@@ or attempts to put even greater quantities of this radi@@ o@@ active carbon into the atmosphere .
in the length of with 220 centi@@ meters of the third @-@ smallest animal in contrast , the lens may have a low over@@ shot of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in its investigation in 2012 .
all the major Green@@ land@@ tiles in their lens had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , which is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock for a 4@@ 93 cm long Green@@ land@@ hai showed an age of 335 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 5@@ 02 centi@@ meters can be even 3@@ 92 years old should be expected .
that Green@@ land@@ hai @-@ females first got to rep@@ ay if they are longer than four meters , was well @-@ known .
now the researchers of the length were able to as@@ sign an age .
as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters are probably standing at the thres@@ hold of the sexually mature ones and his age was determined by 156 years , in Green@@ land with the multip@@ lication obviously at least one and a half centuries period .
also this may be what the vort@@ ex is currently being Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme especially live in icy waters is no coincidence .
even the previous record ke@@ el , a 211 year old Green@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose sp@@ eck at the neck was caught a 120 year old har@@ pun@@ ches , was caught before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures it is also frequently used the organism that live there living animals on as@@ parag@@ us .
so they attack later - and al@@ beit slow .
in order to keep warm water warm in cold water , the animals are also often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , by which the animal fits heat .
the heat loss of one gram of a mouse is therefore much greater than one gram of eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a small@@ ish animal is therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many desc@@ en@@ dents as early as possible , &quot; explains the evolution of evolution .
a very large animal should in contrast to its resources more likely to invest in a long life .
Bau@@ yss in a double pack
with topics around the building , the municipal council has focused at the recent meeting .
by relief the committee took the notification of mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the recent out@@ ages could start to be found . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the plot , Par@@ z@@ elli@@ - and subsequent requests were clar@@ ified and the requests for survey participants could be provided , is the sale of ground@@ pieces in the building areas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße 1 ) of interested parties no more in the way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the r@@ alling land in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au young families and equipment sen@@ iors equally appe@@ aling .
as it says , it is possible to report immediately in the City Hall , on the awar@@ ding of the par@@ ables , the municipal council is expected in its September session .
to also request requests for the renov@@ ations of further commercial firms , associated with the creation of jobs , can be decided , decided to change the municipal council , which only appear in the spring of this year &apos;s application development plan in sub @-@ areas .
thus , in the area Lower @-@ time area , the area has been extended by two plots towards State road 21@@ 12 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the main city in Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the city has the best opportunities to move from London moving jobs and companies .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt has benef@@ ited from the Bre@@ xit @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of Kompet@@ enz@@ fel@@ ds financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is un@@ certain whether funds will continue to operate from London operations in the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass , it is now expanding the approval in Britain .
this is just the major USA banks .
several banks have already announced , jobs to shift .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lob@@ lo@@ union &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expects five new jobs on the Main in five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , speak of the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the Eurozone , as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Association of EI@@ O@@ PA and the ES@@ RB .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters in Paris , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; the proximity to the data base is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
Luxembourg is ad@@ mitt@@ edly a large fund branch , cutting but also like Dublin for infrastructure worse .
Frankfurt is much easier to access thanks to the large airport .
further points the city with easy available commercial properties .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
the Seine is also the h@@ iring for first @-@ class commercial properties around 50 per cent higher than the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt have a higher quality of life than competition due to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the corporate consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city was standing on position seven , Luxembourg on position 19 , Dublin at the square 33 and Paris at 37@@ th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if the quality of life is a question of fore@@ love : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I refused I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will remain in spite of Bre@@ xit @-@ V@@ ot@@ um principal financial center in Europe , my business researchers .
for this , the power relations : in London also worked according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba end 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .

on the survey of the law@@ suit on Thursday , US @-@ minist@@ ered in Beth @-@ son Fre@@ eman , that Gilead shall be entitled to the return of the costs , which were created during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to mount Gilead , which domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of h@@ epatitis C medication that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver illness .
the case goes back to 2013 , as Gilead , and Mer@@ ck acc@@ urs@@ ed each other def@@ endants and property on laboratory work , which will fos@@ inate , the active ingredient in the medications of Gilead .
the US supported troops to say that they have re@@ conqu@@ ered complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State .

Hill@@ ary Clinton announced their tax return to 2015 on Friday , this f@@ lowed for the presidential election by the Democrats and her husband , a income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective tax exemp@@ tion by 34.@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ tons USD 1 Million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former president of Bill Clinton had served an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book over their office in the State Department of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ ton Can@@ did@@ at for the Vice President , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax declaration of the last ten years .

&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; announced Clin@@ ton Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i in an opinion .
in a cr@@ acy contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump behind the false expres@@ sions and trac@@ tors with regard to his previous promises to publish its tax exemp@@ tions .
it is custom@@ ary to publish its tax candidates for US presidential election even though they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New Yorker &apos;s busin@@ essm@@ an , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for his obj@@ ection , a tax check by the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote declar@@ ing election campaign for Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , with respect to the publication of the presidential election Committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ aces special advis@@ er , to CN@@ N , that he did not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the check inspec@@ tions are not complete .

Clinton has already thrown up on the subject and published on Friday a video on the Internet , in which high @-@ level Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans call for his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke on the subject even during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refused to do what every other presidential system has done in recent decades and to publish its tax declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;

control has become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that would be named after a billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren buff@@ ett , who would make sure that individuals pay more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama supports the proposal also .
during an election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial le@@ gl@@ omer@@ ate has his seat here , Tr@@ ump into a meeting to exchange their tax expl@@ or@@ ations .

cond@@ oms with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works sk@@ il@@ ors promote dance an@@ ist and eleph@@ ant protection
Natur@@ sch@@ üt@@ zer in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants to go lived in of people - they throw cond@@ oms on them which are filled with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ sts .
the method has proved effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation who had already had the idea ahead of years , together with the US conservation efforts to intensi@@ fy their promotion in villages in northern Brazil , a non@@ violent quad@@ rup@@ ture method of protecting their homes and harvest without being inju@@ red .
previously many j@@ acks have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the dial @-@ ant@@ enna , who is dedicated to the animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit we have developed , we were able to see a change in their settings within these communities , with much more confidence , that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without the eleph@@ ants in doing so , the managing director of Honey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a communication .
the first two steps include the illumin@@ ate of the eleph@@ ant with a tor@@ ch and the bli@@ sters in a horn .
if he is not de@@ ported , a so @-@ called &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; gets projected .
Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mix@@ es with earth is packed together with a fire@@ works menu , whose end up to the ign@@ ition is fil@@ med .
when it is lit , the cond@@ om comes with a bu@@ ggy and spray from Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der to the air .
a har@@ p quite usually already out to chase the eleph@@ ant .
a last chance represents a wh@@ ale , which sho@@ ots a lab@@ ur@@ num @-@ fire@@ works into the air and caused a loud , bright explosion .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director k@@ icks Berliner Hotel , because Israeli re@@ election was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director of Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media ris@@ er after having betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel has not listed in Berlin no Israeli re@@ election as it would have challenged guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust dok@@ um@@ entation , &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his hass@@ le in Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by wrote an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel on the site selection list .
however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via an own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer that he received , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel agreed that the measure would be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; int@@ enti@@ onal decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was , ext@@ ingu@@ ished in the director even more anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was quot@@ ed by Lan@@ z@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli amb@@ assador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov h@@ adas @-@ Trade sman he called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung reports .
we were reli@@ eved of this event and fri@@ gh@@ tened .
this is really very embarrassing .
the fact that this has led to Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even a even greater shame .
this does not require explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident has a pretty large reson@@ ance on the internet when people called the whole a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some under@@ set the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ vening Arab guests &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; ash@@ amed of you , &quot; says it in another article that was pointed out to the fact that the hotel is located on the no@@ ve Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , close to a Synago@@ gue .
the hotel quickly pointed out all alleg@@ ations of themselves and called the incident involved &quot; and &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reported the mirror .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has never been a direct statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel would not be included in the quick@@ set list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung presents a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the code selection has now been added .

the police took Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mig@@ bells against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began as a police be@@ am@@ bled and tried to du@@ ci@@ ve the students that led to the police rubber bel@@ gi@@ ants and pot@@ t@@ nar@@ as .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
according to the proposals by the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ old Al@@ ck@@ min , less than 100 public schools are closed , more than 300@@ ,000 students are implemented in order to save money .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian Ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade agreement between Moscow and Teheran in the year comparison at 7@@ 0,9 % .
since the international sanctions against Iran has been lifted , the interest in both Russian companies and businesses were greatly committed to businesses in the country distributed the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors .
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the further commercial construction is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he extracts the trade agreement between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 by 7@@ 0,9 % compared to the same period in 2015 increases and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports in Iran at 9@@ 1.5 percent jump @-@ off and amo@@ unted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade down@@ turn was achieved by deliveries of machinery , land@@ vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan is responsible for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year the Russian representatives gave around 35,@@ 000 visits , first and foremost a pas@@ ev@@ is@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 countries , which concerns the tourist numbers in Russia .
one could say that the recru@@ it of Irish tourists from Russia last year , broken down , &quot; he said .
at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the amb@@ assador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ raz and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ go@@ w took the an@@ chor@@ age that Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself intensi@@ vely . the J@@ ut@@ um and made the legend as he rus@@ hed to home to get a victory away from the favorite New Zealand .
England claimed four years ago a sho@@ cking victory while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympi@@ ag@@ old@@ med@@ a@@ illen .
she reiter@@ ated the trick , after she took place in March by the World Championships in London despite the entrance demonstration , Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the issue between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver &apos;s Jamie Staff .
they did so in time as a indication of the de@@ af .
actors retirement a gap , the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they remained , when they saw potential in the vill@@ i which has now developed .
addition , Kenn@@ y - which won four years ago with Ho@@ y vic@@ tors - and Sk@@ inner plays in the qualification round a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord , but in the standing round of the New Year in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
for his round fell short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner thought .
a strategy change made a great deal of transformation , in addition to the execution in a higher gear to slow him and make it Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to hold the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as the BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they climb@@ ed to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year sk@@ inner @-@ winner from Glas@@ go@@ w said : &quot; it is a sh@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make a name for me .
in the En@@ dr@@ unde , we have placed an Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord and defeated the world Master .
it was simply amazing .
there is no better way to win this .
after the tri@@ umph of 2012 on the side Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys gave it that he was cut off after a weak start off .
he returned this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
in such an outstanding victory this time was not such a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like London with all the GB flags on the grand@@ stand as London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles , that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad again .
this is an event , a gold med@@ al for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer for our progress in the past five months , we expect a successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ stream .
with the form of Kenn@@ y it is in the sphere of Pos@@ sible that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three ol@@ ymp@@ ic gold medals in a contest .
this would be born for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y who was also born on March 23 ( a apparently sacred date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a t@@ ute of six gold medals and a silver med@@ al .
the wheel of that of Ho@@ y is equal .
Kenn@@ y takes place next in the Sprint that will start today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team @-@ event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be defeated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ al competition of the day , but there were more good news for England .
Sir Br@@ adly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four pole .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
the Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord , which won in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition at the Wig@@ gins with security in focus .
he had disp@@ uted yesterday with author@@ ised before the qualification as he had function@@ aries to afford to measure his body size .
im intro@@ duc@@ tory women &apos;s competition , continues and finished tomorrow , av@@ anci@@ ed Laura Tr@@ ott , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in World tre@@ k@@ ord@@ ances in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team reli@@ es on its strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a shot to medals .
after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations of Rio were shut down .
they played drama in the background , so the re@@ sig@@ nation of the technical leadership Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the middle of Sex@@ is@@ mus@@ - and Mob@@ bing pen@@ ds and reti@@ ring of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
however , if one sees the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ stream , it looks quite like that , now , the legendary call GB@@ s , who at the perfect moment has reached his climax again .
future of the mel@@ ting of port@@ land due to lifting the end of energy frag@@ ile
the future of the aluminum hull of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work stations of workers - stand at stake , because the plant operators termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus to raise all delivery contracts as the delivery of energy supplies .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a pay@@ roll running for 20 years is published in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the area of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are available at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could be too domin@@ ance effects , since the mel@@ ting around 10 percent of the total electricity generation collap@@ as consum@@ es .
in 2014 Al@@ coa the Point Henry Mel@@ zer@@ ei , which led last year to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station .
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and ris@@ ky a closing .
this step follows the years of long spec@@ ulations with regard to the future of the system , originally as a result of the strong Australia dollar and most recently due to the capital price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminum structure with its Lo@@ y Yang A Kraft@@ werk in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with it that three additional owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the complex is mostly owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p will hold smaller percent@@ ages .
&quot; AG@@ L is convinced that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means more physical demand for electricity by the mel@@ ting , &quot; divided the company .
AG@@ L said that the Tre@@ aties will be so @-@ called &quot; f@@ uses transactions , &quot; which would have come into force from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L shows that the contracts will contribute to the income in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the rap@@ porteur . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of the potential impact on the income of AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently restricted by the forecasts of strong dead@@ lines for wholes@@ ale prices .
AG@@ L shared with the fact that the Tre@@ aties were already written in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of ter@@ mination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to pre @-@ book the agreements , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of Alco@@ hol ... the mel@@ ting to operate or ensure the power supply to the m@@ elt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ com@@ itted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. company said that 2010 concluded an 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have come into force from November this year , even though it is still a explanation why it has come back from the contract .
anal@@ ysts war@@ med because of the bad economic relations in the industry prior to the possible closing of the Port@@ land @-@ Schmel@@ z@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago system near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements of anal@@ ysts at the start of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen , that Port@@ land had approximately 600 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts of electricity .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as an electricity producer , that would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Re@@ ality @-@ TV @-@ Star , Kendall is on the Cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ ing of Vo@@ gue
Pedro Jon@@ ator , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the man@@ ag@@ ator and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ denomin@@ ator C@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the co@@ v@@ eted Sept@@ ember@@ ing of the US Vo@@ gue .
Pedro , the brand amb@@ assador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love bringing me the sight of this co@@ vers to wines , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bit of bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ denomin@@ ator and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) as well as the cover of her sister con@@ cludes : they have all planned a surprise party .
this poses the most smart @-@ b@@ aked action virtually any birthday party ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the set , &quot; you stra@@ ined the set , &quot; you are having forgotten ? &quot; with the honest@@ y of a drawing channel on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) but Kr@@ is had to share their other girls somehow in this Pub@@ licity .
with a view to the Sept@@ ember@@ ing the Vo@@ gue has certainly started a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans .
Kend@@ &apos;s big sister Kim likes it , having said the Vo@@ gue cover , ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ ing magazine is a league for itself .
the Sept@@ ember@@ ing is for Vo@@ gue , which is mostly the most cos@@ mopolit@@ an issue of the year .
with a circum@@ ference , which res@@ embles rather an image @-@ band than a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista used by the 8@@ 32 pages of bear@@ ings 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his Cover@@ stars is keen to see so long @-@ awa@@ ited in the last two years pictures of the magazine were un@@ se@@ ated prior to the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ities , &quot; Mod@@ els &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; Mod@@ els , &quot; celebr@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ Award winner and Di@@ or @-@ brand amb@@ assador Jennifer Lawrence was in the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even at the very low chance that woman separ@@ ators - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; break@@ age model &quot; of their generation - is referred to as the former category , it is in good company .
these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous persons or Re@@ ality stars or young@@ sters of today , who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything arises from the denomin@@ ator ) .
you are really talented women who exc@@ el themselves in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last Cover had appeared with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
naturally J@@ enn@@ ers did not like success to everyone .
with its Re@@ ality TV @-@ history , J@@ enn@@ ers was always ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ denomin@@ ator and their colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called it &quot; the Mist@@ ress of Augen@@ bli@@ cks . &quot;
these feelings bo@@ arded over again , when the message come out with the appear j@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but on the mis@@ inst@@ ant@@ age it seems to pass at the point passing .
Pedro Al@@ denomin@@ ator is the Cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ ing from the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
she is running for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters offer you images of themselves on their dedicated Pay@@ wall apps .
she sold by her made pictures of Cindy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ter &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in their free time she is able to see her in Re@@ ality TV . pres@@ um@@ ably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipalities centers show in 16@@ 0,000 people each year
more than 16@@ 0,000 the aid figures of the country are being made annually by the municipal council centers , while the sector assumes the effects of further crises on over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queensland , already three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ real del@@ o@@ gi@@ ers and similar things - are refused to their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already consolidated exc@@ essi@@ vely , are ready for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June next year it is fores@@ aw that this legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the municipal council centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey was revealed by the National Federation of municipal authorities , that thousands of people will be rejected any year .
farmers said that the situation without lifting the federal government would only get worse .
&quot; que@@ ens municipal council centers are chron@@ ically supported , meaning that thousands of people of important services that you need to be refused , &quot; said he .
people who leave violent relations , people with uns@@ ett@@ able and vigor@@ ating debts , families , who were dism@@ issed through separ@@ ations , workers that have inv@@ enti@@ oned problems - all these people have problems of legal kind and this survey shows that they may not be the help they need .
in June 2017 , the federal government is cut by 30 percent , which means thousands of aid people from Queensland to be forced to maintain with their legal problems without any assistance .
we call for the General &apos;s lawyer and judicial minister , as well as Sen@@ ators from Queensland George Bran@@ dis to rise up , in order to raise these middle codes immediately , so people may need the help they need to get in legal problems .
last year the Landes@@ Government met its commitment to raise funds for guidance support on national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centre and their customer communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump fle@@ e campaign after employees supp@@ os@@ edly paid a weapon
new York : Donald Tr@@ umps campaign has been indic@@ ted by inn@@ um@@ erable eternity , after being told that their campaign personnel for North Carolina in February have directed a donation to an employee while in February in a je@@ ep .
the incident is described in a indic@@ t@@ ment which was filed on Wednesday at the Landes@@ gericht by Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software program for the campaign in this federal state .
Bord@@ ini called on to have been waiting for monthly , that the matter would be internally regulated , before he rep@@ lic@@ ated that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;
the campaign manager , Earl Philip , &quot; attracted a pist@@ ole and laid his right po@@ ster@@ ly on the de@@ duction , and r@@ amm@@ ing the run in Vinc@@ ents Kne@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; there was Bord@@ ini in his indic@@ t@@ ment .
having described himself in the local and regional campaign regime , Bord@@ ini introduced that at least four other persons had had the same experience with Philli@@ p , he gave up in the indic@@ t@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be rep@@ ented to be damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave Bord@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the indic@@ t@@ ment comes only two days after the Republi@@ can candidate to a mo@@ il , a mo@@ il in North Carolina said that the Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &apos;s &quot; - Sch@@ uss w@@ aff@@ en@@ owners and weapon @-@ friends should take action if his ri@@ val Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and judge .
Tr@@ umps campaign was clear that the media had demol@@ ished his words from the context and that he would not rise to violence .
B@@ ordin@@ is complaint calls for damages from the campaign to breach the due di@@ ligence and from Philip because of bodily injury and ab@@ id@@ ing damage .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries @-@ elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the Federal federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , there are significant losses in the SPD and CD@@ U .
this was representative @-@ representative surveys of the opinion @-@ research institutes IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black Government level in the north could only be ruled in the north , this is not possible after the survey in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and therefore would have good opportunities to continue on the Prime Minister .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD failed from 35,@@ 6 percent to 24 percent before the end of five years .
the party therefore l@@ ut@@ ches according to the survey , only shortly before the CD@@ U which could rise again to 23 percent .
the third place is controversial between the left and the after@@ words .
the left wing on 19 percent ( previously 18,@@ 4 per cent ) , Af@@ ak would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country .
the Gre@@ ens despite lighter losses with 6 percent ( before 8.3 % ) again in the Schwer@@ iner of Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP have not been represented by 3 percent in the country with 3 percent .
in the Berlin Dec@@ or@@ um sel@@ ector , the SPD is based only on 23 percent ( election in 2011 : 28,@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they had thus behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) but in front of the left with 15 percent ( previous 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ ak would be represented by 14 per cent for the first time in the ministry .
at 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return to a return , the pirates would not miss the one in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 6@@ 126 USB Phone Parent
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator research on the market .
the followers now domin@@ ate the world - his producer experienced a disaster .
the equipment weigh@@ ed almost a half k@@ ilo@@ grams and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thick@@ er and larger , therefore it was not good at hand .
on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ cked .
the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning eight meg@@ ab@@ y@@ tes , which would be today for about two sel@@ fish with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 Gig@@ abyte .
the &quot; Nokia Gl@@ ine &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few Euros , lovers may still buy the tools on the Internet but they are somehow from the St@@ one@@ age of the dormit@@ ory .
but 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator has a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months previously at the C@@ eb@@ it company in Hanover as an &quot; office in the West Coast format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to dam@@ aging standards a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also via fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access to websites was possible via HTML browsers , even though qu@@ or@@ ably slow .
a bo@@ iler was available , a digit@@ ales Ad@@ ress Book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small ant@@ enna , and the mobile phone could be similar to a laptop as a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
rather proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 euros .
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could guess in August of 1996 , that the communic@@ ator of the beginning of the Smartphone era would become .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the mobile @-@ card of the fin@@ s experienced an unprecedented d@@ aster , was eventually sold and handled to Microsoft .
the market domin@@ ate the market today that all arrived much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , this is for very many people today .
in 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold approximately 1,4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple are falling alone of 5@@ 55 million pieces .
global sales with the equipment is approximately 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app supplier and telecommunic@@ ations concept .
in the meantime , around the smartphone , a whole industry has already emerged .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market started at the beginning of 2007 , when Apple Music Director Steve Jobs announced on the Mac World &apos;s introduction to the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he talked with three devices in one : a music @-@ player , a phone and an Internet communication , easy to use via touch@@ screen .
the winner of Apple began , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market already .
you disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the s@@ ages now have Apple and Asian suppliers as Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after his invention .
at the in@@ cis@@ ion , every German today sees 88 times a day on his phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to set up the smartphone even sometimes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina &apos;s sphere , in the Siemens &quot; Executive Board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a cur@@ se and a blessing at the same time .
England must direct the ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only used in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country renew renewal and prosperity .
for me , it was the biggest At@@ tra@@ ktion He@@ ath@@ rows , as well as in 2012 in London , when we run a great expense to ensure that all our nations and regions benefit from the Games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and these will be able to achieve new possibilities for local and firms near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we are already fed up 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces@@ hips , 4@@ 0,000 new jobs , creating youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of us in London , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ rows is too great .
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ amed on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wrong 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in wit@@ ched growth and to leave a leg@@ acies of skills and employment both in the airport and in the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion most expensive infra@@ structural investment program in time and budget , from T5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until T2 , which was built in the midst of the two frequ@@ ented drivers of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third run @-@ up , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is also one .
it is time that we direct this ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and bro@@ aden our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of the England .

on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block the ad temp@@ ting on his desktop publishing , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post , in which it communic@@ ates that users can update their filters in the program to block publicity on social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook with that his des@@ pot would display the enco@@ ding on his advertis@@ ements to make it ad temp@@ ting the recognition of what part of the page advertising is to make difficult to detect .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to handle the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle between the present@@ er open source community and the envel@@ ope have already been underway since the invention of advertis@@ ements , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook quickly comes with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s world @-@ largest company has left into battle for social media , is a strong indication of how a wor@@ rying ad lo@@ os@@ ening for the industry has become . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study conducted by the last year of Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe 200 million people sco@@ oters ; almost four times as much 2013 .
5.@@ 15 billion daily active users who access Facebook through their mobile devices makes hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung 84 percent of the features introduced .
the company has an ad @-@ lock on desktop PCs except as mobile ad recorder has no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for social network and Inst@@ agram shared a narr@@ ator with us .
advertisement on desktop PCs makes a sufficient large proportion of revenue generated , so that Facebook appears to be the investment of such a step as a rewar@@ ding .
on Tuesday , Facebook with that it would be &quot; update pre@@ dat@@ e@@ tool &quot; to have more control over it compared to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Facebook , that Ad@@ blocks have wor@@ rying new filters because they would block contents on the page that are not advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users , this is not a positive experience , so we are planning to address the problem , informed a spokes@@ man of Facebook in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad bra@@ king means that which is why we are instead focused on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to put more control in the hands of the people .
Ms with suspected self @-@ murder on Swiss highway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls us to witness a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday with a sens@@ ing su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .

she died on site .
several riders have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police said these as well as every witness of the incident to report on .

however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a conflict avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosec@@ ut@@ or has to decide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the past five years will show that the drivers will not be held accountable .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that motor@@ ists do not have to assume that a pedestrian traffic immersed in the night on the highway , as it says in the newspaper .
last year was acqu@@ itted a polic@@ eman of casual killing , after they survived a man and had killed that in August 2014 one night was located on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had dr@@ unk and went to the street un@@ conscious , took the judgment .
the Court held that the polic@@ emen who responded to a call -- to an justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and un@@ fores@@ ee@@ able situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has further information on Thursday in the proximity of Morges , should report to the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NAS@@ A Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was according to the proj@@ ections of a new NAS@@ A climate model , probably once inhabited .
scientists at the Godd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of the NAS@@ A developed a model to explore the past of the Venus based on tools and algorithms that res@@ emble them from climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus run with their hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once d@@ ged @-@ like conditions could be raised .
scientists have previously argu@@ ed that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its tight atmosphere .
but the newest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ dly atmosphere , and yet slowly down@@ turn .
the model also illumin@@ ated the to@@ ge@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet was pres@@ um@@ ably more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and facing faster de@@ pu@@ g@@ ation .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun , which was 30 percent mat@@ ured .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS modeling simulation exp@@ on@@ ates the slow turn of Venus its day @-@ side of the Sun almost two months , &quot; G@@ ISS researchers Anthony Del Gen@@ io stated in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produced rain , which creates a thick layer , creates what a umbrella works to shield the surface of a large part of the sun heat .
the result are average temperatures that are cool @-@ recorded than those of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that res@@ embles the evolution that was previously thought of planetary research .
although it was once inhabited , Venus -- in the course of several billions years --@@ exposed to much heat and ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
their oceans di@@ sil@@ ted and their water@@ ways was depart@@ ed from the ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
when their hydro@@ massage with@@ draws only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus , which we know it today .
the researchers shared the findings of their new Venus climate model in the ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy happens as a trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations , the Colorado European Commission and led to the decision @-@ making of the team decis@@ i@@ vely during the decision @-@ making process .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and acknowledge that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last three years I have met my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations , the Colorado Avalon &quot; &quot; &quot; has been met with energy , passion and destiny , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the 50 years of Roy in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of summer , I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this needed it and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations perfectly suited to the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a co @-@ determination of decisions that influence the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not met at the moment .
Sak@@ ic , who had been hal@@ ted by Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank him for his contributions for the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was honoured during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of Jack Adam &apos;s Award as the best coach of the League .
he conducted the club on 112 points and first square in Central Vision , but Colorado was be@@ aten in the first round of the Pl@@ a@@ yo@@ ffs of Min@@ nes@@ ota and missed in each of the last two years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded in the 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points back .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy did win four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Plan and the Aval@@ ai@@ che .
nor@@ des@@ ol@@ ers resume talks on , put strike out of
the struggles in relation to the wage payment for North @-@ oil workers are exposed , as all of the dispute @-@ parties set aside for a new round of discussion at the table , we told the negoti@@ ators .
strike against oil companies , Wood Group were spor@@ a@@ dic@@ ally managed on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group and the Un@@ ites and the trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to rest@@ art the legislative process of current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is stated in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will keep some year @-@ day sessions over the coming weeks , starting next year to tackle the problems .
the unions also said that their final strike , who is the first in over 25 years is to be a protest against possible pay@@ ings of up to 30 percent .
wood Group has donated the rates to its contra@@ sts in the North Sea by around 9 per cent due to negative market pressure .
the short@@ ening of the company follows a 10 @-@ percentage decrease in on@@ shore contrac@@ tor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released to its part of thousands of people and plans to give up plans for its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries because it moves its business activities as a result of his meg@@ ac@@ on@@ ization by the British Energy Company BG Group .
energy companies are based on lower cru@@ de prices under pressure , an economic situation that has been reinforced by the British decision in June , which had reinforced the European Union .
the Scottish parliament@@ arians Dave Anderson hit the beginning of this week with workers &apos;s leaders to discuss one of the biggest job disputes which has been held since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not only a few works , &quot; he said in a statement .
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in North America , compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler is the Rot@@ ation rate of stars in the star@@ ry christ@@ en@@ ings of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Vok@@ al@@ ope has helped astronom@@ ers , the complete catalogue of rotation to the stars of the stars of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades .
the new data helps to understand the Astr@@ onom@@ en , why stars in the star clu@@ sters can wre@@ cks in different rates , and in which context the Rot@@ ation @-@ periods with the planet@@ arium development stand .
&quot; we hope that through the compar@@ isons of our results with other star@@ ters , learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s infr@@ ared and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star@@ ga@@ ze of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is located 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the Earth .
many stars in this clu@@ ster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
it is now fastest .
in top @-@ top rates these triple stars encounter large amounts of star@@ ches .
because this Win@@ ds are travelling through the magnet@@ fields of the stars , they have a bre@@ mm@@ able effect on the stars .
when a star is aged , its rotation of rotation begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler is about the rotation of each star , by sending the time between the appearance of an recogni@@ zing star @-@ st@@ ains -- like sun @-@ st@@ ains -- .
the newest catalog of rot@@ ational rates points out that massive stars revol@@ ve over less massive stars .
Reb@@ elli@@ ges res@@ embles the stars with dancers , taking bigger stars s@@ lower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; the Pl@@ ei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , while getting faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
as the star clu@@ sters of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades so close , it serves as an ide@@ ales cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rotation .
&quot; the star clu@@ sters of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades offers an an@@ chor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there is still a lot ahead of us what we would like to know more about how , When , When and Why stars slow down their rotation , and so to speak to &quot; dance gloves . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported in three cont@@ empor@@ aries in detail about their recent analysis of the rotation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , which soon appear to be released in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball @-@ Star come from
the tears allow Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the U.S. bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to base .
after his em@@ otive activation , the 41 years old professional will take place on August 12 against the Tamp@@ a Bay , last time the Tri@@ k@@ ot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I tell &quot; goodbye , &quot; declared the 14 @-@ star @-@ star @-@ game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ guez was chosen to the most valuable player of the League , 2009 he won with the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series .
his signature under a ten @-@ year deal has been successfully concluded with 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
by the end of the department , on 31 December 2017 , he will work as a consultant and youth coach - in full content .
as a player it paid a Rodri@@ guez long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 31@@ 14 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 @-@ 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed to raise some mil@@ estones in 2005 .

however , in the retirement of the bases , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be absorbed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for so successfully Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - at the field , so controversial his appearance outside the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the Super@@ star took place at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ster@@ oids &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was locked to the so @-@ called Bi@@ ogen@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is considered to be the main public , for years about an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern @-@ Florida to get @-@ promoting funding .
after a dispute the sper@@ re was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done for a favor for the year 2014 because I was re@@ played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez then South @-@ time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his f@@ are@@ well @-@ days didn &apos;t get irrit@@ ated .
while many bas@@ eball legends in their final games have once again given the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bench .

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en Xin@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Dest@@ inski are first di@@ op@@ ing@@ res
caught : because of a positive D@@ op@@ ing@@ ample , Sch@@ mi@@ k@@ ber Adrian Dest@@ inski from Poland in Rio do not start .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ res .
a deser@@ ved Ath@@ ali@@ ation would have gained nearly a med@@ al .
in front of the seventh race , the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ falls of the Olympic Games have become known in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swi@@ mm@@ ers Ch@@ en Xin@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre @-@ obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish Str@@ ch@@ the@@ b Adrian H@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critical Ath@@ le@@ tics competitions are coming those news at the time .
at Ch@@ en has been demonstrated the di@@ ure@@ tic around hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de last Sunday that is used as a mas@@ king instrument for dop@@ amine substances .
the International Sport@@ club CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local ex@@ clude at the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , so it missed the bronze .
on Friday afternoon Ch@@ en would have to be attended over 50 m of the art @-@ style .
Ch@@ en has applied the opening of the B @-@ sample and an hearing for the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national trade association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demanded by Ch@@ en full cooperation in investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quot@@ ed Xin@@ long from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work together with the International Sport@@ ist CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , it is no longer responsible for the IO@@ C but the CAS for the restoration of athletes with positive cases .
also at night of Rio sick@@ ed the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , which at 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to self @-@ off@@ ense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my four @-@ sto@@ cking result was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an awesome shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said the bul@@ b TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it be inno@@ cent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only declaration could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Ath@@ en@@ word@@ press . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report it is meant to act on the ver@@ bot@@ tom@@ ful substance to negotiate the blood@@ d@@ ough EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was pro@@ visional pro@@ visional , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample has also been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ iko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w immediately addressed with criticism of the Ath@@ ali@@ ation .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the ath@@ l@@ ete doesn &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said , &quot; we Bulg@@ arians stand under review , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
thus , about all weights from the chron@@ ically @-@ driven nation should not take part in Rio .
on Friday he was also known as &quot; Adrian G@@ inski &quot; , the London @-@ Olympi@@ asi@@ eger in the class until 85 kg was tested positive on the an@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both capture the intake of both may not be able to start in class up to 94 kg .
in front of the launch of athletes , particularly the case of Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another hard blow to the reputation of the entire sport .
the World Association IAAF did the whole Russian team , except for systematic dop@@ hin@@ ts , the start is banned , as well as the L@@ äu@@ er Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition , the former associations in China had also taken care of severe conflicts between athletes and athletes .
in this way , the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Var@@ our@@ t got the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ eger Sun Yang hard .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt Purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m of movement , I want to commit myself , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio .
sun was also at the center of a confrontation with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and respect for d@@ oping sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positive for 2014 in the Chinese championship . had a positive influence on the stim@@ ul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had only had a three @-@ month lock .
data : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ pres@@ sive h@@ acker from their ran@@ som
programmer from ext@@ or@@ tion @-@ mal@@ ware is up @-@ to @-@ date companies - and are successful in this context .
according to a recent survey of mal@@ ware @-@ off @-@ defense experts Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes in 540 enterprises in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed companies were at least once , partially a few times victim of a attack with Er@@ pres@@ ser software .
in Germany just under 20 percent of companies were already the target of a pension fund black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims make claims that requested by the perpet@@ rators are requested to use the access system and data again .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize its ground@@ ing software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attack in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially yiel@@ ding solution falls clearly higher than with private user use .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of the proper@@ software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chief of Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 most of the mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then we discovered the perpet@@ rators of ext@@ or@@ ating software to themselves .
first , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was horri@@ fic quickly in the past months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware currently works after a simple pattern : once staying on the computer of a sacrifice , she looks for over@@ long changed files like Word@@ Storm , Ex@@ cel@@ es or database files as well as archives about images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ted the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als lasting .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the presses .
in order to get the end code into the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ ypto@@ ving Bit@@ coin - sign .
however , where private use of the personal photo database is at stake , it concerns companies for sensitive customers data or project databases without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage fails when a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware suggests .
22 percent of the German companies affected by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 per cent had even needed to inter@@ rupt the business operation , in case of a case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , many more hospitals have been a victim of attack , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of health acts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are saying the victims always : pay no , it only encourages the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of firms pay , pay their data again .
for managers , it is difficult , given the stand@@ still to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators .
the h@@ ackers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a current study , the safety researchers from F @-@ secure the user area and contact with black@@ mail@@ ers are examined and coming to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
you explain to its victims by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , free accessible support websites or de@@ code for example files .
and they will rede@@ em individuals according to payments of a few hund@@ red@@ ths , companies need to have some tough negotiation and five @-@ dig@@ it sum@@ s to rede@@ em their data un@@ encryp@@ ted .
given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ik@@ ol@@ ous profits from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware @-@ black@@ mail , the h@@ ackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work , explains safety assistant Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of Anti@@ virus @-@ provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within one week . &quot;
likely , it is however that it is three or four people .
the programmers sell their poll@@ ut@@ software then in the form of a software fitting to the actual ext@@ pres@@ ser .
the previous mal@@ ware kit were created by drawing up mal@@ ware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price range between 1,000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is a adaptation tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ sel@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ mailing list for a further h@@ acker in order to dissemin@@ ate the fresh@@ ly sold software under the cas@@ u@@ alties .
we live in a service sector .
so you log@@ ged in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal , and charges another one to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per ann@@ ot@@ ted calcul@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually carry the crimin@@ als then sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ sel@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known by many companies that make their data better .
more than 50 percent of the firms working companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey hope to rely on R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful sustain@@ ing , the perpet@@ rators are instead publish with the publication of sensitive data such as customer list or pricing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to this , the potential for damage , depending on the type of data is much higher than before .
in future , the perpet@@ rators will be able to take completely new objectives in the internet of things in the future .
in the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrate the security researcher , how to get it with the Internet connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter , the freedom of such a met@@ abolic process could be quite worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ r@@ ator then instead of the heating in the future block a whole production road in a factory , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware could also be a topic in the industry 4.0 .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and easy @-@ to @-@ use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ pé and also the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sound pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1,60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the bond , it doesn &apos;t work closely at any point .
the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top falls since somewhat .
versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V storage space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a suit@@ case of 453 l at high @-@ made and 10@@ 26 l at folding back@@ rest , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical as it sounds : the sitting areas of the back@@ seat is folded like chin @-@ chairs , and thus offer storage space , which is high from the ground up to the ceiling . 1.@@ 24 m .
the trunk zone can be well venti@@ l@@ ated , however , the load @-@ height is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008 .
the tested 1,6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 PS acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to torque @-@ speed up to 300 Nm in wide torque @-@ areas very powerful .
however he may set up a bit lower on his work .
encouraging is the everyday use of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another engine : one 1.5 @-@ l @-@ gas@@ oline with 96 kW / 130 HP .
one @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the di@@ version should be a little more direct .
the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top version &quot; Executive &quot; .
the security systems is part of the City &apos;s Emer@@ gency Assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the track @-@ assistant .
the coll@@ is@@ ions@@ war@@ ner sometimes conf@@ uses because he points to the ran@@ ate many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ed@@ itary objects . &quot;
very reli@@ ably works on the Fern@@ assist@@ ent .
and the intelligent tem@@ po@@ inter is responding to the road detection and d@@ ros@@ sel@@ t if needed the speed .
the full connectivity is only available to the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More .
two US@@ B@@ - and a HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and therefore are somewhat aw@@ kward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest that much , will receive the gas@@ oline from 200@@ 00 euro , the diesel oil from 23@@ 000 Euro .
the engines carry out the Euro @-@ 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line is not liable : Stur@@ z on Flug@@ gast@@ bridge
an Air@@ line is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the flight bridge .
for a liability is only concei@@ vable only with dangers that are typical of the air traffic , argu@@ ed the Ober@@ land@@ es@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down with the overthrow of a knee rests .
but the accident could have all happen everywhere - it is a general sense of a general sense of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay the man no compensation .
disease cases : when paid the promot@@ er
sick vac@@ ation@@ ers get money back after their trip just when the cause of the disease is undoubtedly to be found in the hotel .
but this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests suffered from the same symptoms .
in the following case , a family was seriously hop@@ ed on the second day of its tur@@ quoise @-@ lau@@ bs .
she spent almost all of the holiday in the room .
their disease led to holi@@ day@@ makers on a def@@ ective loading situation that supp@@ os@@ edly covered the sea@@ water .
the family was the view , the journey had been lacking - and compl@@ ained against the promot@@ ers .
in the court the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had no success .
in fact the se@@ wage situation was indeed def@@ ective .
but the event was used only shortly before leaving the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff .

for sure , our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hate and split .
this tri@@ umph , we will not treat the terrorists .
if off@@ ences would have to rely on the country , the level of security and intensity is also the approval of the population for the refugee policy .

to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister keeps a better social care needed .

in addition to the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the internet ( Dark@@ net ) , Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the deployment covered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Minister said clearly against shareholders .

better traffic flow at the motorway
regular - here is a regular basis on the di@@ aling road - here is a picture of November .
but that is to change : the rule @-@ ab@@ ide is supposed to be extended .
that is good news for all the cars that drive in the occup@@ ations on the surrounding road every evening in the St@@ au , if they drive over the motorway : Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the provincial road construction extends in the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer street and the exit Wes@@ eler road crossing the right @-@ trunk road to 700 meters .
motor@@ ists can then turn directly from the hammer street to the right .
the great advantage : the traffic does not share early @-@ time , whereby the overall investment will be improved on the many @-@ driving section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U group in the district Rooms Münster @-@ West .
the driving distance along the road is nervous the motor@@ ists especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days from the back of the bridge to the bridge over the Alber@@ ian Way and sometimes even beyond .
the reason is the adel@@ öh@@ r on B 51 just before the departure of Wes@@ ale Street .
from here the traffic only one @-@ lane is lo@@ wer@@ ed over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built before a well @-@ three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had revealed that the bridge no longer has the required capacity to absor@@ b especially the heavy @-@ duty traffic .
like long of these narrow @-@ pass and related hard@@ ships , the state enterprise can not say .
but it has to be reck@@ oned with years : for the bridge has an official resi@@ dual duration of up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal ab@@ bi@@ eg@@ ot@@ ur the state enterprise consciously chosen the traffic @-@ we@@ aker time in the school holidays because with a disability is expected .
the traffic will be f@@ aint on Tuesday and Wednesday in the construction site .
CROSS @-@ cultural travel : cultural activities for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a musical project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s offers young people with a migration and refugee background , cultural institutions in Münster to visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning BO@@ B &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young the@@ aters Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the association N@@ ima &apos;s initiated &apos; Inter@@ cultural journey &apos; visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years old in the small house .
since the beginning of the year , the association , who has set itself the cultural integration of young people with a migration background and a refugee background to attend schools offering welcome participants as part of this project cultural institutions in Münster .
most of the young people of the class are between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria came to Münster and is very little German .
thanks to the chore@@ o@@ graphi@@ es , the s@@ zen@@ ische Bilder und Video@@ animations let them have been possible to follow the action on nonetheless , so the press release of the boy The@@ aters Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. T@@ ann@@ az Wester@@ berg from spra@@ yer , and the Young Theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a Musik@@ the@@ ater@@ projek@@ ts .
from October to December young people with and without escape and mig@@ rational background , between 14 and 20 years old will receive the opportunity to attend professional courses in the fields of singing acting , dance , acting and music .
special offers for children and families in the area of theatre and the@@ atri@@ cal language skills are in the planning stage .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Tourism &quot; continues .
given the increasing refugee numbers , the association is counting on many classes that want to participate .
rain instead of star@@ gates : hope for weather @-@ repair
the weather has had the star @-@ dro@@ ves in the south @-@ west of Germany at night to Friday a stroke by the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was badly suitable for clouds and rain , to observe the cel@@ est@@ nut spectac@@ le , the chair of the ob@@ servatory Wh@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is the night on Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we certainly see many star@@ s@@ cri@@ bs in the sky .
the stars are Persian , which belong to the fastest star@@ gates with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come forth from the stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the northeast .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening , one would be ever@@ lasting around , at night you sit aw@@ ake , in the morning there is no longer think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institut , about a quarter of adult sleep problems and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing .
how are sleeping troub@@ les or sleeping disorders ?
there are several forms of sleep dis@@ rup@@ tions and there are multiple causes under@@ lie , Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ys , association member of the German Society for Schlaf@@ forschung and Schlaf@@ medizin .
what one understands on it is , but the ins@@ som@@ nia is , therefore an input and sle@@ ep@@ y disorder .
just sleep emp@@ athy many people as uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , association member of the German Haus@@ physician association with practice in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is behind Schlaf@@ störungen ?
the causes of sleep problems are complex .
behind it can create organic , mental or cor@@ c @-@ related factors , but also medicines .
not rarely is the sleeping @-@ distur@@ bing expression of a different disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says we@@ ther . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it may be that various factors thank each other .
anyone who has for example has a sli@@ pped disk , can lie bad to wake up every two to three hours and start bl@@ ur@@ ably about everyday problems and care to greet , there is We@@ ys an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
from when to go with ins@@ cri@@ bb@@ ing to the doctor ?
who has been doing well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected by the day should go to the doctor .
the imp@@ air@@ ment may look quite different : one is de@@ pressed , tired , in@@ exhausted , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has bal@@ lot fluctu@@ ations or bodily symptoms such as stomach or head@@ aches .
to relie@@ ve the sleeping distur@@ bing , it is important to find out their causes .
as a treatment options , among other things , behavi@@ our@@ al changes , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medicines - classic sleeping @-@ coated tablets just in exceptions and at most for two weeks - in@@ qu@@ ire .
approved sleeping @-@ medic@@ s , there are hardly surprising studies in Germany , emphasises Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , Head of the Research Centre of the Char@@ ité Univers@@ ität@@ smedizin Berlin .
therefore , one should turn to the po@@ atri@@ cian at first and turn to the po@@ di@@ in@@ arian .
the can be clar@@ ified with exam@@ inations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should be in bed laboratory , and what happens there ?
for resear@@ ching in the sleeping @-@ laboratory medical , for example , for snor@@ ing with respir@@ ation , for illness @-@ free daily , during sleep , or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleeping @-@ disorder , explained Fi@@ etze .
nowadays , you must not need to prepare for the study .
it was possible to normally spend the day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just do not make a mid@@ day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the short@@ ening one goes to his normal time in bed .
beside the electro@@ des in the body one has a rhin@@ estones , a chest strap , and a ant@@ enn@@ ant at the finger .
additionally , a camera draw on the ceiling .
how can the people cope with the handle ?
there are quite a number of adjust@@ ing screws , one can adapt to a better sleep .
wisdom counts on : regular dor@@ ms and time @-@ up times , not to sleep in bed on the day , do not watch TV to sleep , alcohol , and at night watch - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s totally un@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has vo@@ iced the DS@@ V @-@ Teams in Olymp@@ is on Facebook .
in December 2014 he held gold at the short time Championships in Doha for the first time and presented his first world record at the same time .
now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Mark D@@ ei@@ bler via Facebook sound@@ ed its presence in the criticism of the ex @-@ team @-@ m@@ ates .
&quot; in a country where a Olympi@@ asi@@ eger 20,000 € premium gets and a jun@@ k 15@@ 0,000 € should not be wondering about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 year @-@ old at night on Friday on his Facebook page .
the convey@@ or system in swim @-@ sport is bad , the D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls , however , very well .
in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not want to see or operate the subject at d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t tell you to set the controls here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler had already been reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping @-@ agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is how one should keep it with countries too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who cannot be controlled a certain period before the World Cup / OS by independent controllers from W@@ ada / F@@ ina , must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the vote of Hamburg which has now operates an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de von Certi@@ rier Re@@ fir@@ ing
professional services at Düsseldorf Airport
civilians by the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police to take on Thursday the capture of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years .
the Tat@@ dam@@ ned was committed as a gang of several pick@@ po@@ ds and luggage .
against 21.@@ 30 pm , civil officials recognised in the area of the airport Düsseldorf a gang that was known from the gen@@ dar@@ mes of past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several Del@@ ik@@ te since the middle of July and were a collabor@@ ative , working @-@ on and very professional .
the experts of the crime rate 34 can witness the thi@@ eves that were sl@@ ated to Germany who have been written by criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four acts .
at the same time , they had explo@@ its a total of more than 15,@@ 000 euros .
Alt@@ built , a couple of lin@@ den@@ ies , meanwhile a rema@@ inder street in Berlin @-@ Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ hain , at first sight does not appear so , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
when driving the road from east to west , one gets along the places , a fres@@ her nur@@ sery and a bite .
to the fa@@ ç@@ ade of a grey house someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot;
opposite from a Li@@ dl , who will soon be demol@@ ished , it is already built : until 2017 here a house with high windows and 133 new flats can be built here .
article about this &quot; tr@@ en@@ ched district &quot; as the relevant property company of Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ hain is called , the last few weeks , however , preferred to be preferred by burning cars .
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile , the residents have rented apartments , but on the ground floor there are rooms still open spaces and are used for events .
especially the Berlin sen@@ ator H@@ enkel had repeatedly called for a hard approach to police against the project in the beginning of the year , the area as &quot; No @-@ go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point for autonom@@ ous violence .
after 22 June the spaces were vac@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ mon@@ schm@@ iede , with 300 police officers , pat@@ ched the police three weeks long official statements , according to 30 to 40 officials and three Mann@@ schafts@@ wagen locally , im@@ pregn@@ ated parts of the street and kept visitors of it to enter the house with number 94 .
meantime , renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown owner @-@ owners the rooms .
on 13 July a Berlin administration Court decided that the clear@@ ance was illegal , and one day later the police and construction workers under the rejo@@ icing of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the road works peaceful : parents go along with kids walks , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain in front of Sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects lies a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left force is not the main cul@@ mination of many inhabitants : Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the area since 1999 and Jana * , which draws here three children from the police presented here .
with the inhabitants of the home@@ work they share the concern of rising rent and casting .
it does not sound after a pine that could cause a majority of pol@@ ish pol@@ yn@@ esia from v@@ and@@ al@@ ous left .
the dit@@ ch , which of the Berlin sen@@ sen@@ ator and the police between the land@@ owners and their neighbors un@@ fold , does so obviously not exist .
Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ hain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which still has a low average pace in comparison to the rest of the city and has high poverty .
also hous@@ ings and the resulting dormit@@ ory belong already long to the area : 1990 , numerous houses in the former G@@ DR were occupied , including the entire Main@@ zer road very close to Rig@@ s .
while the mainstre@@ am had been cle@@ ared up at a ver@@ right road station , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Rig@@ s and still are inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the urban district has become increasingly attractive to mag@@ net for tourists and elec@@ tors , from around the world : they now divide the inhabitants from the G@@ DR @-@ times and former house@@ wives .
this has also been noticeable by the h@@ iring , which has risen since 2009 for new rental suppliers around almost 60 percent .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ s are attacked as symbols for this development : one reali@@ zes them in acc@@ ru@@ ded dis@@ ks or fresh@@ ly painted fa@@ ç@@ ades which have been covered with col@@ ou@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned this year in so often with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lin@@ ks@@ aut@@ on@@ ome violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason why not all neighbours see that as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body viol@@ ates , according to statistics are almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the off@@ ences make atomic facts that tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ gate beside the controversial 94 years , there cannot be any talk of uncertainty .
as far as it is concerned , she is descri@@ bing : the people in the 94 are their neighbours that they certainly not have been .
also the famous inc@@ iner@@ ators cars put it right in the Rig@@ s for longer any longer .
for the studied architect , her street is not a crime point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has become conscious of the rig street - and stayed there .
therefore , it was also so important that the n@@ atives with@@ drawn their road : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the bor@@ ough .
but in the eyes of inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to take away : by secured new@@ builds in former buildings that im@@ pose the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the main property apartments , which are not interesting for many here - here rather people who are not so good to bed , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; force and destruction cannot be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appro@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if someone has never heard one ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides fru@@ stration , even with the police and the occup@@ ants .
for looking @-@ drawn that is anno@@ yed at ri@@ bs , Kerstin has little understanding : the houses @-@ projects and the left scene belonged to the area .
who moves , should be aware - just like someone who runs into a pub that can complain about noise from there .
all persons named only with first names have asked to be called not by their proper name
Ur@@ bach : Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee camps for refugees
Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organizers .
moreover , it is a social worker @-@ worker on site .
since July , Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le became the refugee camps for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ical supports the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees himself as a contact for all actors : refugees , associates , refugee camps , administration , authorities and who else is mist@@ aken .
Reg@@ ine customer from the Arbeitsk@@ reis indicates that an hon@@ or@@ ary more than thankful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is there , the ei@@ er@@ legen@@ de Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au , which has a problem above all .
so some - less sp@@ ot@@ ting as rather on the multitude of desired objectives desired - meant to be able to write the spot .
sear@@ ched for was a administrative power with a talent for languages and people , connected with many years of experience in the field of social work , just an ins@@ cription of Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au .
yet administrative work is not its central area , says Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it comes to organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes , as well as ret@@ inal activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been in the process for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent place in the long term .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le ehr@@ mann and full @-@ time actors supports .
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
soon there are new containers in the washing machine
a serious problem has been recognized for some time , apartments for the connecting people who have been recognized .
for the connecting generation , the municipalities are responsible .
you need to put refugees in own or rented apartment rooms .
the cost of building , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Federal Council of Comm@@ une and Job@@ centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord will offer his apartment .
the search for some time is very difficult .
de facto the administration has no private apartments .
so far no , it has not been dependent on private apartments , so D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore the local apartments have to be visited as it is so beautiful .
so , soon new containers will be placed in the washing machine .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keywords , Reg@@ ine customer and Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed base , there are practi@@ cable , training places , educational sites , A @-@ euro jobs and assistance staff for refugees and migrants who have to be established or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; said Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building or help hous@@ ings , do not work non @-@ profit work - and this motiv@@ ates and very neat as Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community being a positive impact .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not only mean job .
the day do a fixed structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
human beings have to develop a depen@@ dency .
so it offers opportunities like sport , contacts with local people and especially language courses .
professional courses are r@@ ar .
so you can also jump to manage and honor volunteers .
it &apos;s central that the refugees get the feeling they are really appreciated and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you have to declare the refugees that it just takes and they can cross the time useful , for example with language courses .
who will eventually develop the feeling , he could not help into Ur@@ bach , don &apos;t work and be useless , which will never be integrated .
the distinct majority is motivated .
problem cases , though , there are also , says customer honest , &quot; people , at which nothing goes on . &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customers may therefore always motiv@@ ate others too .
this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : do the two are afraid of radic@@ alization by the two after recent occurr@@ ences , also in a small municipality like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer very clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some na@@ ï@@ ve call it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a rests could be could and if they do not want to ex@@ clude . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sensitive , the hel@@ pers are already being sensitive .
these inci@@ dents are also topic in the refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks put them completely in re@@ vocation .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with them , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many would love to stay in Ur@@ bach .
thus , the main and honor of volunteers must remain in place and in the region to activities .
they always put in the background that soon a new shock may come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany require a limit ?
this question is clear to answer , fear policy .
actually , it is unfair to place them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived in Ur@@ bach where we would like to go , &quot; said Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher even proved themselves to be reasonably reasonably .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
yet when people are in need , they can help them both women agree .
the political situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : crus@@ her with helic@@ op@@ ters
the police helic@@ opter flo@@ pped about an hour long different areas - un@@ successful .
two un@@ familiar men are penet@@ rated by the Friday morning against 8.@@ 50 am for@@ ci@@ ble in an apartment in a multi@@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabitants surprised the two and sm@@ ote the in@@ hol@@ ds into the escape .
the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 26 feet tall , probably mas@@ hed , carried both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black ho@@ vers .
they fled the direction of downtown .
for the fo@@ rest@@ ation the police took several wr@@ ap@@ pers as well as a police helic@@ opter .
the fo@@ rest@@ ation went without success .
maybe the unknown before the apartment may come close to the apartment or their flight .
