<seg id="3">"" "" "" "however, the two US presidential competitions are in control and energy policy as well as in a single market policy." ""</seg>

<seg id="8">He himself wouldn't be different, claiming Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will strongly retracted regulations, and it is strong for the far-reaching tax reform with lower tax-modes - for both individuals and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "Clinton said," "" "the state has specific duties to meet, he has the disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, the taxes would increase for the rich, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the issue of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the misses to be invested, Trump and Clinton almost worshifted.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic Applicas announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State capital programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are strictly opposed to the state-State Teaparty-wing of the Republican Party.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus Trils can therefore still be in internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Significant are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump will build coal turbines and restore the coal production in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil-makers should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Parisian climate agreement he wants to cancel.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "Clinton is about to expand and challenges the renewable energies with their investment programme:" "" "a country becomes the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">However, not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two contenders are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazifish trade deal, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the US want to isolate the US from international trade, but they simply want to protect American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">The people should also be better paid, about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage from 7.25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it up to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump will do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rinsist, then he says, he will not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop rather more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand stands Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and its citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics spoke to him, so the budget deficit would only grow bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand Clinton, who at least want to demand from the rich, that they pay more taxes and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of aliens"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that a crisis ended.</seg>
<seg id="3">Leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and announcing an official end of eight months a long-term war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin brought his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palastray in reception, I can not honor the imprints that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But plin smiles was unallied and he has barely lifted up warmth, even for its withstanding relationships.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, talked to his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report whole five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">It could not count any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said likewise, that relations with Russia could not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better to improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day he described a newspaper that Erdogan would have been heard as if there were never something worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">Seemed to me more the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin brought radiant, sustainable cool, that the State of Russia had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his quotes, the plane of a Russian fighter plane at the border with Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was to be crowned.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin told him and accused Ankara to fell in his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">Going out was even bigger, since it was committed by a alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetrauen re-building will be difficult if it cannot be impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">Months long the state-controlled media led a severe, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed like the Turks to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the serious test, allegations of leading officials were that Erdogan has profited their own family from illicit oil trade in areas of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place just because Putin received the President of Erdogan what he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire are clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily needed all the friends who can get it after spending the last month at a failed coup d almost his home.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repetitive terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey in particular - in particular the ban on charter flights which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel agents and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">You are counting on a delay in the Mediterranean bush.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, they projected the state-television, cheap fruit and vegetables once the Turkish agriculture will be imported again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti it follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an added political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West as it is the response to the tried to power takeover a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">To do this, the lasting Groll come across the snail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to take advantage of the cool atmosphere and to reduce the relation of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of President gained a bonus in Ankara with certainty that he searched for the prosecution and asked support for the elected officials.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-known for Moscow remains a matter of course, which itself has a deep-sitting fear of regimplant.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendorous palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey as it proving me to represent an analytical drive "alliance of outsiders": two countries that come across from the West and eventually feel poorly treated.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest difference between Syria, where Moscow had recently played the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey have counterposed ones.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be signifying that after almost three hours of initial talk both president at the press conference said they would not even touched the issue once.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey assessed it visibly on a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and considering the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO interflowed in Turkey, it is certainly better that the two leaders are talking to each other at least.</seg>

<seg id="16">I am now saying that we are not pursuing a global targets but local goals.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our staff will work under these brands with customers.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that it will no longer lead to six Nations sponsoring and that it will increase the perception of the different brands in their sports sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it's time for us to develop into the bank of the Marche, because how do we focus inside (we have asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the forehead.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical, if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these marks.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think will see many changes.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Russian President Vladimir Putin brought out his staff, Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was many years part of the closest family relationship of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed as the Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin, it is that Putin without stating for reasons" "" "Ivanov's dismissed his duties as the chairman of the Russian presidential administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who stayed since 2012 Ivanovs Substitute was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">1972 born in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he made his completion at the prestigious State of Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website, it is called (Russian) that he subsequently became the Office and the Office of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said about his appointment he said to Putin, "thanks for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a head of laws concerning legislative measures and controls in order to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked for his post to leave his post and to be Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convinced the ridiculous faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov has been a long time in one of the narroest confidence of Vladimir Putin and works as he works for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a charge of Stabilief he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television broadcast both men, that the staff returned to his own wish.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the surface for cameras, here are few of them convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is a result of a kind of power-fighting?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is what nobody currently knows.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who was once challenged as a potential president, at once the Russian environment wants to be guided - came to great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks about Putin, who are quoted on the site of Kreml, Ivanov "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say this very complicated post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov adopted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">He was then deputy prime minister and defense minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin's former member of the National Security Council of KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin Chairman of the Bundessional authorities (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy chairman.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin put his power in his power, Ivanov was regarded as one of five people whom he trusted the most familiar.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once assumed that Ivanov's second term president could become President of Russia, as the third presidential of Putin would suppress against the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, incoming allies Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister, before he became president of three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="5">Yet arguments is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, it is about the question: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments actually?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "CEO Christoph Bratmann says:" "" "we agree with the Green party:" "" "who wants to build on urban areas in future, should end 20 percent of all the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Left wants even more hardship for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of what, as Bratmann, there is a tightening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the manual is implemented, it will ensure additional tasks in the construction administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will receive the professionals.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not entirely clear: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, that should be built already.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does one compares the loss of more about 1,300 cheap apartments, whose funding will be taken over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">Only by the year 2020 there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent that, so the planning of planning speech in Nicole Palm, should now be ashamed of the city now.</seg>

<seg id="26">To one fell swoop the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">For in the West city they run to the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get back into the price list for cheap apartments.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teens and child to play no longer outside, but rather prefer to spend their time outdoors, screens to screens, has been wailed in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">For Pokemon Go, it's about getting people from the couch and become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to television, then on video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that were based on the characters who were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later resulting from an cartoon animation, playing cards and other spinoffs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena in the population, the interest in the launch of the game in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand was slightly different in the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries has been postponed by massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon has had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons which are tracked with a GPS and once they once have been found, "photographed" (about a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when they were younger, joined the Wahn and sprang up for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA the game led to a considerable rise of steps that returns the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, the 35,000 users informed, the Washington Post reported recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who of which Pokémon Go plays - it merely doesn't see the raw data on the performance enhancement.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to take "30 minutes" time, "out of the couch," and "to be active on dove ears as many public messages are boring and coming from people who look like.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless the importance of sport can not be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who drives a regular exercise regularly, reduces his chances to deal with cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in controlling control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderfull of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors, making them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even exclude new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there is a Styrian player who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it meant?</seg>
<seg id="27">It is a breakthrough that is made.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps such as the FitBit has been following our activity earlier, they didn't give us reason to do sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will leave with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemons, however, there will be more games, the apps and virtual reality with the activites are combined in the real world and help many people on the hunt, more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need guidance, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I put forward in the Turing Olympiad in the Turns and this is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">Firstly, I have been organizing the Olympics from 1984 to each summer and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three Turnerves, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which are inspirational for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin and Madison Kocian, the Cathocles is, round, making every proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflected the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has captured the black and hispanic woman presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among the female gymnast was an Afro-Americanist.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year we were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympiagewinnerin and America celebrating.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now, the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple power of the triple world championship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as it has been unexpected, but masterfully Gymastical routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday was Simone die fourth, heterosexual American, who won in an individual seminar event for women Gold.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we do not see sport classes in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie suggested all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "last Five" because the next Olympiamity is going on only four turers in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality tells you that Turns is an expensive sport and can be maintained first and foremost in private turnouts, which are maintained by parents for the training, insights, travel and hotel costs (for the trainers and their Turner and families). the list may continue to be continued.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sneakers are located in wealthy suburbs which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the Turner will receive her entire training and that is a most expensive and long-term commitment to families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainee of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer by Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes and since they started the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must be inspired to the congregations innumerable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a powerful and easier inaccessible gym.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my Turnfoundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">With my events we offer free and affordable turkeys in Harlem for over 15,000 young people (especially black and hispanic) and national and international winners have been trained.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we are expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality turbines that will make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great olympic sports.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and identification for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination provides life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that bringing thousands of young girls to interest in the gymnast and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby und Madison for this true representation of "Girl Power" by the Holen of the olympic Mannschaftsgolds and thank you, Fass gave her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British passport underlined its immune system and worms in a serious test - by speckled some of the most narroest and arrest places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel autor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scrapped his course on a euro Schein, a gel at Piccadilly Circus, a dishwasher, a tension toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of the flakes of each object he used a Luminre to show themselves and to us what it is to be settled.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," bringing some amazing results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, the insing of a draw toilet, which was already used by thousands of others, may be totally repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr. Wright spoke with physicians and medical specialists about the promotion of bowel bacteria, as well as his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left out of what he speckled, more than a bad foretaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestines by journeying through the world and to eat peculiar as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations to rampp of toilets, the task presented his immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told, "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned what my health concerns and I have put all kinds of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was sure to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused, was a dirt public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sampling showed a Luminometer value of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">As a result the Luminometers is freshly weighted hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refrain, after their Luminometer value over 4000 units was, while freshly washed hands of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Valio produced the Reisefilm "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacteriths in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "This comes the worst thing that I have found in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will do nothing here because it is here inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company, Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuormaa says: "we really wanted to offer the consumer something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something which is fascinating to look at and at the same time explained the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we led to" "" "Brainstorming" "", "that ended we said" "" "Luke us Ian" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global one</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the gut's health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the direction of the film, added: "let me tell me so - I would have spent my respect for Ian when he told him to leaks, just like the epic Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things in which it was easier to get Ian, to touch them and others, with which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In one of these survey conducted survey conducted in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents republactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 per cent said that they have at least occasionally use products that included lactobacillus bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021 the country-elections will not be held once again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner of Parliament decided already at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For it is as yet so far it is not: summer holidays, heat and grassroots. this is happening.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who are to be convinced by the voting members are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">The most vacationers that are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so may not choose the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">To do this, practical problems: in the holidays are helpers, the posters lobbles, balloons, flyers can be distributed and examped at the end of the voices, just laborious less laborious.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until the 4th of September 2016, the electoral and the last holiday season, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has yet to come forward with an election campaign just under the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of the SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.</seg>

<seg id="13">Thrilling is thrills, how strong neuling Afroses and what remains at the end of koalitioning.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister, makes an almost inconspicuous campaign meant to be seen by his grandfather.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travelled through the country, distributed roses and plausimmets a little with the people, just as it was already his legendary running ancestor predecessor Ringstorff.</seg>

<seg id="30">At the end of 2011 the SPD had become clear to 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, small parting with seven percent in the polls, should be allowed to create the leap into the day of land.</seg>

<seg id="6">At the present time, the biggest augrower can move in the past year despite its many brands and some well-moving markets further to a plus.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in July, the nuclear marke was weakened, especially in Western Europe and therefore again charged the total sales, as that was authorised in the Dax.</seg>
<seg id="8">Worldwide, the brand VW in July with 449100 cars 1,8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year's month.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, on to China the second most important market, sales of 14 per cent below the previous year's month.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market Germany, the excavations supplied by nearly one sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brand Jürgen Stackmann led the weakest figures in July primarily on two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, it has given it in several key markets by "changing economic conditions" a department of purchase.</seg>
<seg id="13">Apart from the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote was also debited from the EU, explained a spokeswoman.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the U.S., where the gasiter were first escalated, is also continuing to raise a minus.</seg>
<seg id="15">Big support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">All in all, the mainly affected account of the Lower Saxony is incomparably worse by the Dieselscandal: after the first seven months only a model of 0.9 percent to 3.6 million vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="17">Consolidated Fred Kappler was able to advance a sales point from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">1,3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time, 5,904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had manipulated with a software check-in.</seg>
<seg id="20">Alone in Germany VW about 2.5 million cars calls for conversion to the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of the re-change, VW, that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "after the change of the vehicles, it will give no notice of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, or motor power." ""</seg>

<seg id="24">"" "" "" "legal graciousness." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">The "focus" was reported to Volkswagen waters of its German customers now even a guarantee of scaffolate diesel models.</seg>
<seg id="26">These were confirmed on the last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Department.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Ministry of Transport has been confirmed that there was this meeting.</seg>

<seg id="31">"" "Volkswagen itself uses the term" "" "guarantee" "" "but not as it was meant to be a company name." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">With the wide term "guarantee" Volkswagen makes the opportunity to have customers for example a half year after conversion, around with a motor vehicle - and this could result in the new software, even if the damage does not have anything to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even in the customer interest it is important to avoid that it is in case of misaids other damage, which at all have nothing to do with the abyassky scandal, to ensure protection with regard to possible guarantees of guaranty as it meant.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who is buying a ballet?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-age love sheets.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you get to the commentary box to overlook it under the pseudonym non-offs of men with gray insults: this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, is the versatile reconstruction of sound plates, not to have a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all predictions after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older platters still retain their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone spending time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But will the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a message report on TV, I would follow the camera while I move in Soho in a busy street in Soho, a humble muzzle anage and wildly gesturing, before I keep coming, my hands, and a definite prediction as: "so, let's have a close look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let us take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart consists of sohos slowly to its charm - Hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where there were once an independent seller - there is still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera to the next part that I stand within walking distance to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and age through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I attended by Sister Ray (MSW: two young women, three men middle aged) to Reckless Records (MSW, a woman, presumably about 20) followed, is a day long because of a meeting in London and passes through the deals in order to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, question I?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already reckon," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">This soundproofing, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I do not follow him home), dress the walls of his dwelling.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates, which he could not afford as they appeared and once again buy items that he sold, when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I purchase, are released from the late '60s, early 70ies, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably was doing something to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who are buying panels are more introverted and like to spend their time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink too much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray also believes that many customers he meets to apply to the YouGov's Profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">But he also has noticed a new wave of people who have heard of the Mediafpe, people who have heard about the comeback and prompted them to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the conversations that I have led, guys are usually done so about 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who bought their records to buy CDs now, sell their CDs to restore your boards, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of a postponement of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional value of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offers a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some turnfans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw himself to the stability of trusted sound machines, of objects, the blissful student.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think it sometimes can be the colt of a void or possessions of material possessions than a type of comfort," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as collectors, and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to get spiritual.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social worker!" "" "we have a co-worker from a records stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record in the last month they have not been heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey took also out that 41% possess a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who own a record, no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the message I would probably look very concerned while I blunt through a stacks in Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, the at sounds of the Universe (MSW: three men's middle age) works, has noticed a "trophy" of the realization.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone only came here recently here and said," "" "I did not get a record player, but I would like to buy a radial ton sound, so that I can put them into a shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a large percentage but it's definitely going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="41">More products-reliably, less musclous.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">Those are younger people, not older ones that are only slow to come.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated to the Plates almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I reroe.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and women middle aged.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above listed shops - Wild Beasts neuester synthesizer and sexbepacking pop instead of experimental jazz penetrently from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks sonderant lonely, but nagging psychological traumas are difficult to determine if one stands next to someone 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs around the shop for some minutes and considers the variation of the plates available.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a shovels more than a large one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not earn much, so the collecting of panels is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from one computer or another, but the beauty of hard drives is... it is driving with a lover?</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop, by which is said that a new generation of record keepers shall have inspired: urban outfit.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the gift to Jeans-Hotpants to Musters, I observe a group of young teenagers, who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking of buying a crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at it - maybe because they are only clean decoration, some so far above that it is impossible to touch it.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry, and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research inquiries made that the results of YouGov agree, they do, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record value, which exist in reality, record stores and in Onlineforen.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday mornings with security, not with the stroll through records from Berwick Street and the leaf through records, while taking the rigid view of an uncanny, 30-year false moderator, who spoke about the shoulders of low age-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain in the 7-er Rugby came in the finals on Thursday evening in the final hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were awarded a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro stage here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji ertrushed a master class in the handling, Side-Stepping, post-back and ruher power to win gold - her first Olympiamedaille of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was promised by the not too bad trophy of the silver medal - Great Britain on this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this competition in which they smote the New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But irrespective of that Fiji had taken a 15-man team in gold form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a comfort for GB - but it will likely not - that at least a Brite tomorrow have a gold medal to hang his neck at: Fijis Chef de Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">Britain had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago it lost under Ryan of each game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost just one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This bckle is waken, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and left the attacks GBs from fun bouncing.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. in, when you would walk in driving buses. the World Series winner went 5-0 to the top, seen as Osea Kolinisau in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes playing time, Jerry Clwai still invited another attack from the right corner, which he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB has hardly taken the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A raging raging part of Mitchell stops the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa, a third goal, but it did not keep Fiji on.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute lete Jasa blasphemalua in the right-hand corner a touchdown and it got 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa has added another since the remorff and there was still over a minute of play... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou preapped by further weak tacklings of the GB Team and rushed to line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is so as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while I still seeded.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is the same.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB resulted in fundamental changes to the half-time and shut the fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Josue Tuisova had ran through a brilliant stopplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started out an attempt for GB, made a touch-down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran for long in favour of Südseeinsulan, whose fans sangen, flags and danced on the bleachers.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the cake with another try in the last seconds.</seg>

<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks to the front in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with a impressive foot work, and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant delayed, Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-aside team, ensured the prize - and thus the silver medaille.</seg>

<seg id="3">From the first stroke of the last, 220 hard cieve, which enter the story, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in its golden moment on the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only the two who were sitting in the boat, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present as they ruined for the second Olympiagold in a two without tax-wife in a row, the first women in the history of the British Sports who submitted such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Your dominance was absolutely, after all, you have made an unfolded use, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of sponges, which is not reflecting the way of the triumphant to geese.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the veins is a battalion of luctant helpers who make the difference and it was no one assistant as the coaches who would not survive at least 30 months ago whether he was diagnosed with cancer than he was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="8">How he said, he is risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, who is operable and which did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, he spreads throughout.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather worse situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had luck that he could be treating early 2014, outside the season, which had kept the interruption to a minimum if that under such circumstances is the correct term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better myself again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Herds in itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inmediocability of victory, their first thought of Williams came to form a nerve racking morning so she tried to talk more than usual and therefore tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Panning available as captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emotional wreck. that's perhaps something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It repeats just how much this meant that much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no one, therefore a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach of the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have a better person to coach or want a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not keep up with their opponents.</seg>

<seg id="8">When this week caused a filter to some users, who gave them slice, wrong teeth and afflicted cheeks, there were some critics a racist caricature of Asians - "Gelbface."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The messages and the rebellion were widely used on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and motherboard, one day after Snapchat that it could have been deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>

<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats filtering a picture creates that for a user is insulting, "so it is much more difficult that such things was unnoticed when it was the case," said the 25-year Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product trainer and Ingenieurprojekte for medium to delete their Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen des Trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, they are the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel permanent and inescapable, a rapid run-run between competition and striving.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the olympic Fackel itself would be a burning rod from the watchstrap, for swimmers to the garner to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen while listening to your neighbours in queue in the coffeshop without having Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and is a female black with crimples, would certainly have played among these well-known names that are sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and well-being-TV commercials if he would be a swimmers, gymnasts, or even fats.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the olympic trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not shine any event equal.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports, which are not commonly recognized: air pistol, archery, Badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest, and may it be long reign.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I can clearly make arguments for my particular darling, then let me direct the attention on the discreet charme of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline was already a olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was noticed the last 16 years that many people asked, did not know that it is a Olympiasportart at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the US athlete sent to the competition, there has never been a medal in the trampoline and has had a athlete until the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians to share for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jump has a certain outsider, partially because it sounds suited for an unenlightened ear for a Clownsschule than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, it's just a little bit enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never benign buzz - but also the Grazie of the sneak and diving, the two sports that combines it essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word 'trampoline "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" jumping board. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of decaying movements (turning, pups and saltos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are evaluated according to official Vaprox after the execution, difficulty level and 'flight time. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-long athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, are in Rio to face each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common olympic Vektor is almost straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their quest for gold faster, faster, upwards and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and back, upwards and downward at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but in the television transfer also another height of the target: that of the world or the Olympian ords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The target-looking strives is nobel, admired, even fanatics - and it is enough to tears even a spectator.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I personally feel when looking for these games as something tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">This offers the trampoline a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline-jumper is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A downward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prallt, apparently weightless like an astronaut, goes to the top, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no woven into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the Competition can only be with the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">Qualifying and Endrunden of women will take place on Friday morning, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; most of the men on Saturday, also around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will beate the Endrunden as part of an afternoon-bloc on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of Olympia-Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, a which is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the awareness raising, only by the aggreening and the objectification of athletes may be achieved - like it claims the male US Turner according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Dooley is expecting his to air rinks, new fancommunity.</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators are calling for political changes in Ethiopia, turning the violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that umpy protesters were killed during the clashes with the police with sussing.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to come together?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the last ten years, there has been one of the stabilizes countries in Africa, a solid part of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months the protests against the government shaken the country and turned into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to roads and requested fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer of the government was unmerciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave to that policemen on two unarmed protesters were poured and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Located in the circulation, sensitive videos about the protests which are presumably dated from the last or beginning of this year, show such safety men young people with shocks, while these were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The leader of the UN authority for human rights now demands an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to overhead this country and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated land in Africa in Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight against terror over the region particularly in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expands at the caustic speed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuresin in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Israel was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations, headed the repression through the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, which dissidents effectively were brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or to prison, killed or killed in the desert of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you press people and don't have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at the central Ethiopian.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover all from the ground-use to the stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a further criticized election last year the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea; a fight for this jagged, controversial line in June hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are concerned that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were imposed more or less forced in recent years, the turmoil and regain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitching after years of suffering from the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years there were a lot of Ethiopia in a position to communicate with the social media as cheap smartphones were becoming more frequent and improved the internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government detects access to Facebook and Twitter as they are in regular intervals, many people can still communicate via internet proxies who want to hide from where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave they their way to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For Ethiopia, the Amharas, who come from Aegean, mainly Christian-countries, in politics and the economy, while they are the Oromos exploded, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate with a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests found in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which affects approximately 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in military service, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the turmoil is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebellion of rebellion, was up to his death in a non-compulsive disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think about its corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts are saying that he was particularly well-versed in order to use early signs of discontent and special officers in order to handle opponents and make it detrimental.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill" "", "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict-analytic." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray Region of Northern Sardinia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts are saying that he does not enjoy the confidence of the controlled safety services rendered by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "the last time that Ethiopia was living a moil in 2005 after thousands of elections protested, according to the indications provided by analyst the government and subsequently were stolen." ""</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raid, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in recent months and this time of unrest was relatively fast over.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development of experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, as well as the new pope-train, as well as for their measurable steps in the poverty abatement.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of the internal misart of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">The last month demonstrators in Gondar, a amharian city, of Tigray-guided businesses and the hatred against the Tigray is becoming more and more commonly used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts are saying that the protests the US and other Western allies can bring into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even though they are undivided that it closed its base.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenlandhai: the oldest fluo is nearly 400 years old</seg>

<seg id="3">Greenlandhaie mostly occur in the winter to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "this shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the" "" "Sanna" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims it with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to the present day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenlandhaie has only 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vastly, the Greenlandhai lake goes along the edge of the North Atlantic at an hour it is an average of just 1.220 yards away.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes up, the five meters long animal is accelerated at satte 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a robe with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This from loneliness, but seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science," in any case by a Greenlandhai that might be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Schinklein from the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life-span that means for vertebrates a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">Though, the evolutionists had long been presumed that Greenlandhaie stony are.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenlandhaie are difficult to observe, finally, they live mainly in the ice-sea before the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water tem-temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually dive at the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">More information about the life styles of the Greenlandhaie know researchers in accordance with little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time-pentagonal maives, when they remedied six animals from the top ten animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey make this haie nevertheless: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had the jaw of a young ice cream swallowed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they chase them asleep animals or patrolling at the bottom of the iron and look carcasses, which torate from higher water layers down to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenlandroutes, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 Greenland or Svalbard as a dingy out of the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was only 81 cm long, while the largest 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the linsencore of sharks with the carbon-14-method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eyelids occurs already before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it later are no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the linsenhead.</seg>
<seg id="25">Its birth should therefore lie after the early 1970s as an atomic armor attempts to put even greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of with 220 centimeters of the third-smallest animal in contrast, the lens may have a low overshot of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the major Greenlandtiles in their lens had normal carbon-14 amounts, which is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact the carbon-14-clock for a 493 cm long Greenlandhai showed an age of 335 years, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters can be even 392 years old should be expected.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenlandhai-females first got to repay if they are longer than four meters, was well-known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length were able to assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimeters are probably standing at the threshold of the sexually mature ones and his age was determined by 156 years, in Greenland with the multiplication obviously at least one and a half centuries period.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this may be what the vortex is currently being Weltrekord.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme especially live in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even the previous record keel, a 211 year old Greenlandwal, in whose speck at the neck was caught a 120 year old harpunches, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures it is also frequently used the organism that live there living animals on asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they attack later - and albeit slow.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm water warm in cold water, the animals are also often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal fits heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of a mouse is therefore much greater than one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smallish animal is therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendents as early as possible," explains the evolution of evolution.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should in contrast to its resources more likely to invest in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus run with their hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once dged-like conditions could be raised.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously argued that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its tight atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the newest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, erddly atmosphere, and yet slowly downturn.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the togeography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet was presumably more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and facing faster depugation.</seg>

<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures that are cool-recorded than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously thought of planetary research.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data: so perfide erpressive hacker from their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmer from extortion-malware is up-to-date companies - and are successful in this context.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of malware-off-defense experts Malwarebytes in 540 enterprises in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of those surveyed companies were at least once, partially a few times victim of a attack with Erpresser software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany just under 20 percent of companies were already the target of a pension fund blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims make claims that requested by the perpetrators are requested to use the access system and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize its grounding software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attack in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially yielding solution falls clearly higher than with private user use.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying fast evolution of the propersoftware," explains Malwarebytes-Chief of Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then we discovered the perpetrators of extorating software to themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was horrific quickly in the past months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware currently works after a simple pattern: once staying on the computer of a sacrifice, she looks for overlong changed files like WordStorm, Exceles or database files as well as archives about images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the Ransomware and deletes the originals lasting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the presses.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the end code into the files, the victims need money - mostly in the form of Cryptoving Bitcoin - sign.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where private use of the personal photo database is at stake, it concerns companies for sensitive customers data or project databases without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage fails when a Ransomware suggests.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the German companies affected by Ransomware, 13 per cent had even needed to interrupt the business operation, in case of a case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, many more hospitals have been a victim of attack, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of health acts.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we are saying the victims always: pay no, it only encourages the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of firms pay, pay their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult, given the standstill to reject the demand of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a current study, the safety researchers from F-secure the user area and contact with blackmailers are examined and coming to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You explain to its victims by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, free accessible support websites or decode for example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And they will redeem individuals according to payments of a few hundredths, companies need to have some tough negotiation and five-digit sums to redeem their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risikolous profits from the Ransomware-blackmail, the hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work, explains safety assistant Chester Wisniewski of Antivirus-provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware about within one week."</seg>
<seg id="28">Likely, it is however that it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutsoftware then in the form of a software fitting to the actual extpresser.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kit were created by drawing up malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price range between 1,000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is a adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisselewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailing list for a further hacker in order to disseminate the freshly sold software under the casualties.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you logged in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal, and charges another one to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per annotted calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually carry the criminals then spammers with the spread," "" "explains Wisselewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that make their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the firms working companies in the Malwarebytes survey hope to rely on Ransomware using file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful sustaining, the perpetrators are instead publish with the publication of sensitive data such as customer list or pricing," "" "explains Malwarebytes-Chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Due to this, the potential for damage, depending on the type of data is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators will be able to take completely new objectives in the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the HackerConference Defcon demonstrate the security researcher, how to get it with the Internet connected thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the freedom of such a metabolic process could be quite worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrator then instead of the heating in the future block a whole production road in a factory, Ransomware could also be a topic in the industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one would be everlasting around, at night you sit awake, in the morning there is no longer think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institut, about a quarter of adult sleep problems and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How are sleeping troubles or sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disruptions and there are multiple causes underlie, Hans-Günter Weys, association member of the German Society for Schlafforschung and Schlafmedizin.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands on it is, but the inssomnia is, therefore an input and sleepy disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just sleep empathy many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, association member of the German Hausphysician association with practice in the Anglo-Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind Schlafstörungen?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep problems are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can create organic, mental or corc-related factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleeping-disturbing expression of a different disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is common in depression," "" "says wether." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that various factors thank each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Anyone who has for example has a slipped disk, can lie bad to wake up every two to three hours and start blurably about everyday problems and care to greet, there is Weys an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">From when to go with inscribbing to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who has been doing well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected by the day should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look quite different: one is depressed, tired, inexhausted, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has ballot fluctuations or bodily symptoms such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To relieve the sleeping disturbing, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options, among other things, behavioural changes, a cognitive behavioural therapy or even medicines - classic sleeping-coated tablets just in exceptions and at most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">Approved sleeping-medics, there are hardly surprising studies in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Research Centre of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, one should turn to the poatrician at first and turn to the podiinarian.</seg>
<seg id="24">The can be clarified with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should be in bed laboratory, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">For researching in the sleeping-laboratory medical, for example, for snoring with respiration, for illness-free daily, during sleep, or if you don't find the cause of a sleeping-disorder, explained Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">Nowadays, you must not need to prepare for the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">It was possible to normally spend the day.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "just do not make a midday," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the shortening one goes to his normal time in bed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Beside the electrodes in the body one has a rhinestones, a chest strap, and a antennant at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">Additionally, a camera draw on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can the people cope with the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a number of adjusting screws, one can adapt to a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Wisdom counts on: regular dorms and time-up times, not to sleep in bed on the day, do not watch TV to sleep, alcohol, and at night watch - then you start to reckon immediately, and that's totally unducive.</seg>

<seg id="1">Altbuilt, a couple of lindenies, meanwhile a remainder street in Berlin-Friedrichshain, at first sight does not appear so, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">When driving the road from east to west, one gets along the places, a fresher nursery and a bite.</seg>
<seg id="3">To the façade of a grey house someone has "ugly!"</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite from a Lidl, who will soon be demolished, it is already built: until 2017 here a house with high windows and 133 new flats can be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trenched district" as the relevant property company of Friedrichshain is called, the last few weeks, however, preferred to be preferred by burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile, the residents have rented apartments, but on the ground floor there are rooms still open spaces and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Especially the Berlin senator Henkel had repeatedly called for a hard approach to police against the project in the beginning of the year, the area as "No-go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as a starting point for autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After 22 June the spaces were vacated on the ground floor, the Kadmonschmiede, with 300 police officers, patched the police three weeks long official statements, according to 30 to 40 officials and three Mannschaftswagen locally, impregnated parts of the street and kept visitors of it to enter the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meantime, renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown owner-owners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July a Berlin administration Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and one day later the police and construction workers under the rejoicing of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the road works peaceful: parents go along with kids walks, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain in front of Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects lies a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left force is not the main culmination of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the area since 1999 and Jana *, which draws here three children from the police presented here.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the homework they share the concern of rising rent and casting.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound after a pine that could cause a majority of polish polynesia from vandalous left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which of the Berlin sensenator and the police between the landowners and their neighbors unfold, does so obviously not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which still has a low average pace in comparison to the rest of the city and has high poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also housings and the resulting dormitory belong already long to the area: 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including the entire Mainzer road very close to Rigs.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the mainstream had been cleared up at a verright road station, many of the projects were legalized in Rigs and still are inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the urban district has become increasingly attractive to magnet for tourists and electors, from around the world: they now divide the inhabitants from the GDR-times and former housewives.</seg>
<seg id="21">This has also been noticeable by the hiring, which has risen since 2009 for new rental suppliers around almost 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigs are attacked as symbols for this development: one realizes them in accruded disks or freshly painted façades which have been covered with colouds.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other street was mentioned this year in so often with the words" "" "linksautonome violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason why not all neighbours see that as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body violates, according to statistics are almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offences make atomic facts that tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tengate beside the controversial 94 years, there cannot be any talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as it is concerned, she is describing: the people in the 94 are their neighbours that they certainly not have been.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous incinerators cars put it right in the Rigs for longer any longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a crime point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has become conscious of the rig street - and stayed there.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore, it was also so important that the natives withdrawn their road: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the borough.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants like Neugebauer, the road will continue to take away: by secured newbuilds in former buildings that impose the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are the main property apartments, which are not interesting for many here - here rather people who are not so good to bed," "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "force and destruction cannot be" "" "approve" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone has never heard one?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides frustration, even with the police and the occupants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For looking-drawn that is annoyed at ribs, Kerstin has little understanding: the houses-projects and the left scene belonged to the area.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who moves, should be aware - just like someone who runs into a pub that can complain about noise from there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons named only with first names have asked to be called not by their proper name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee camps for refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Moreover, it is a social worker-worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July, Annika Deuschle became the refugee camps for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogical supports the team of management around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees himself as a contact for all actors: refugees, associates, refugee camps, administration, authorities and who else is mistaken.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the Arbeitskreis indicates that an honorary more than thankful that Deuschle is there, the eierlegende Wollmilchsau, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less spotting as rather on the multitude of desired objectives desired - meant to be able to write the spot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Searched for was a administrative power with a talent for languages and people, connected with many years of experience in the field of social work, just an inscription of Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yet administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it comes to organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes, as well as retinal activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been in the process for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent place in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle ehrmann and full-time actors supports.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the washing machine</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been recognized for some time, apartments for the connecting people who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the connecting generation, the municipalities are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="19">You need to put refugees in own or rented apartment rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of building, rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Federal Council of Commune and Jobcentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord will offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for some time is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration has no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far no, it has not been dependent on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore the local apartments have to be visited as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, soon new containers will be placed in the washing machine.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keywords, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed base, there are practicable, training places, educational sites, A-euro jobs and assistance staff for refugees and migrants who have to be established or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," said Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building or help housings, do not work non-profit work - and this motivates and very neat as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community being a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean job.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day do a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">Human beings have to develop a dependency.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it offers opportunities like sport, contacts with local people and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you can also jump to manage and honor volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It's central that the refugees get the feeling they are really appreciated and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You have to declare the refugees that it just takes and they can cross the time useful, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who will eventually develop the feeling, he could not help into Urbach, don't work and be useless, which will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem cases, though, there are also, says customer honest, "people, at which nothing goes on." the work of Deuschle and customers may therefore always motivate others too.</seg>
<seg id="47">This is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two are afraid of radicalization by the two after recent occurrences, also in a small municipality like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer very clearly," "" "what some naïve call it" "". "a rests could be could and if they do not want to exclude." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitive, the helpers are already being sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also topic in the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks put them completely in revocation.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with them," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would love to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">Thus, the main and honor of volunteers must remain in place and in the region to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always put in the background that soon a new shock may come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany require a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer, fear policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived in Urbach where we would like to go," said Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher even proved themselves to be reasonably reasonably.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">Yet when people are in need, they can help them both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
