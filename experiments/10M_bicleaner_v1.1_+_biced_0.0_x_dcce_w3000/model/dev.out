Obama receiving Netanyahu
relations between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Teh@@ ed@@ ans dest@@ abil@@ ising measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the meeting , it should also go about conflict with the Palestinians and discussed the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is critic@@ ised the ongoing proceedings of Israel , and it casts a lack of desire during the peace process .
by the Obama &apos;s deal deal with the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two continued wor@@ sen@@ ing itself .
in March he had held an controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the U.S. Congress , held partly as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the upcoming election in Israel .
in a call to have raised professor , his girlfriend
in a call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb with a somewhat c@@ itt@@ y voice of the police he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his home .
Lamb it was important to empha@@ size that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said , the family letter of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house we found the bodies of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a hand written notification it was so sorry I wanted it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; that was according to the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb that taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississippi , has already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where according to the police he has recently created a popular history of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door on his office and killed .
Delta State University Poli@@ reve@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Universal employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has done the bra@@ iny emergency day after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : the lam@@ b took the life , when the police att@@ ained him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one day after the shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ tur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what &apos;s more motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , they helped create a picture of a talented , but potentially difficult teacher .
students said they were fre@@ ed upon his lessons .
the police at Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ ent@@ iss died , he did not have a history of violence or a criminal history .
for him he was written in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both lec@@ tured in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose capacity of 17 members consists , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some incl@@ ination to be problematic .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , the Lamb praised , he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something with him was wrong . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said that Lamb tells him that he had at the end of 2014 @-@ 15 with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb previously had asked the Delta State University to give reasons for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he provided only two on @-@ line courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the University meant that the Promotion should be so hard for the Lamb as hard , for him would be no guarantee for an automatic journey to be assistant as assistant @-@ Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Universal President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said , he is nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions , the Lamb is no longer able to answer .
after the flight out of the campus the police took later Lam@@ bs lane , when he returned to Mississippi from Ark@@ ans@@ as .
before it could be arrested , he k@@ issed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house approximately a mile south of its parent house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still going on in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
it was not immediately clear why the Lamb came to this house , but Johnson said that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants , and has under@@ signed ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he rehear@@ sed in the spring in ped@@ ago@@ gi@@ k .
one of the long standing girl@@ friends of Lam@@ p drew him to be intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and lam@@ b was 20 when they met together by common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool old guy who tried several years to teach her guitar game .
he was at the time of the women &apos;s black .
all girls sound@@ mol@@ ces there , when he was there , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson fo@@ rest@@ ling of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ ere@@ iss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the call he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but there was no judgment of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick @-@ house that is adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , she was just 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally wre@@ cked on the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said S &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he never met , but due to his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb interested in music was and blues played .
Lamb met Pr@@ un@@ iss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail climb@@ ed both in the summer of three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and s@@ ings their own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nur@@ se who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ ke@@ eper , and sometimes enter@@ tain@@ ted Co@@ ordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak illumin@@ ated bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss Night in the night 5th September for the last time he finished his guitar and oral harmon@@ ic game over a sp@@ icy audience .
there were no evidence of something that something did not match .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were at the au@@ fr@@ y and j@@ oking with each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of pleas@@ ant@@ ness .

Michael J. Fox Cer@@ mes on his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting at the theater for the Roy@@ als , and I mer@@ ges that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me in mind that I am a sim@@ ulated knife and a arm @-@ length of it , with the prin@@ c@@ ess of Wales on a date .

UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary of Ban Ki @-@ Moon says that its response to Russia has increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN Chef once again calls on all parties , including the UN Security Council , to join and integr@@ ative negotiations for finding a political solution .
the Secretary General said a press conference held on Wednesday that he is planning to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member states of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the General Assembly to meet this month in order to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regret that the dis@@ divisions within the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make this situation un@@ sol@@ uble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity at the meeting of the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear war with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 surveys , show that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
some have done him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper entran@@ ts in surveys down , it has ( still ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys have shown Donald Tr@@ ump in the two @-@ dig@@ it area , and some start to wonder what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ation of the real estate .
of course it is too early in the election period .
nobody claimed that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nomin@@ ation .
experts empha@@ size that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership has been handed over to the rising Herman C@@ ain , from which no one did win a state in the nomin@@ ation process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but outside groups like Je@@ b Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C , and the conservative economic group Club for Human Growth now recognize Tr@@ umps &apos;s capacity and begin to let their dollars flow in order to overthrow him .
here are some current surveys that indicate that the real estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
P@@ umps Pop@@ ular values have turned around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump received his can@@ did@@ acy in the middle of June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans were positive to see real estate @-@ fashion .
until mid July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now have six of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep themselves in the early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac tuning in I@@ owa made last week that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as a candidate .
in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week said 67 percent of the Republi@@ can , they would be either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son will create about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent , they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 per cent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next going in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; uns@@ at@@ is@@ fied &quot; or &quot; angry , &quot; if every Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate would become .
a majority of the Republi@@ can sees g@@ umps temper@@ ament does not appear as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and vigor@@ ating statements , 52 percent of the people &apos;s rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in Irish voters believe the real temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first fo@@ al state of the nation , the federal state I@@ owa where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can may think he has the personality for a com@@ mander , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 per cent believe he is not the personality to effectively perform his position , and almost six of 10 inde@@ pen@@ dents say that his temper@@ ament did not miss the White House passe , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters are used to the idea .
if they set up their schol@@ ars , apply republi@@ can voters Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked , who will best be the GO@@ P nomin@@ ation , say after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C in the past week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten End of July put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters in the past did not have the clear cryst@@ alli@@ gel in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four of ten Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans were thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nomin@@ ation against only 28 % for the final Candi@@ date Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless it shows that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters will see a plau@@ sible campaign than plau@@ sible .
even if the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump remains almost everybody .
some experts point out that the frag@@ mentation field is likely to contribute to a m@@ umps &apos;s leadership during which anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is diff@@ use in more than a dozen different candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump will re@@ ap the widespread support .
he did not lead to Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 Points , vor Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before the edge of Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only can@@ did@@ at that strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur of 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump fans says that they have formed their minds .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters , the Tr@@ ump will support , say that they have established their votes .
of course , much could happen to change that , and no one can truly say never to change the opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the pump is the strongest competition in the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ ch@@ ir@@ urg Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ er that they have formed their mind are twice as frequent for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say that they are dis@@ agree with Tr@@ ump in immigration .
since &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rape &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rape , was the immigration and ful@@ crum point in public dis@@ course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic dig@@ an expression of Tr@@ ump @-@ American H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away by the Republi@@ can party and def@@ use the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC @-@ post survey conducted by Monday six out of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans that agree with Tr@@ ump in issues of immigration .
so long as long as immigration in the spot@@ light remains , it will run Donald Tr@@ ump seems to be done .
the fru@@ stration over the government climb@@ s to new high@@ ates .
at Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son falls on half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly by their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they rather prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry in Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa three weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated via the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ at@@ is@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co. : the five most exclusive living in Germany

a new study shows , in which special clim@@ ates cost a square meter the most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student @-@ bu@@ de in Munich are not really a little .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not cher@@ ish them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had Bayern Lah@@ m ahead of the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ aki stadium before the game 3@@ 1,6@@ 88 hot @-@ blood@@ ed fans - and the M√ºn@@ chner witn@@ essed a word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without sh@@ iny .
Pi@@ re@@ aus has won his recent six home games in the King &apos;s class , including against well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l√©@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 I stum@@ bled here Bor@@ ussia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , in@@ defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up Du@@ els with Greek teams did not want to be the next victim .
they went to be mu@@ sty , with their obvious endeav@@ ors but often to be influ@@ ential in works .
the attacks have been too often passed by the player &apos;s left on the left Douglas Costa , who rarely got through the former Braunschweig Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ella@@ ou@@ i .
M√ºller had more luck far from the right , than he struck his side from the right half @-@ box in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion were the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one was Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ St@@ √ºrmer Ide@@ ye Brown the head of the Poles suggested by the Line ( 26 ) .
then by direct reference , the go@@ alie &apos;s Roberto with the knee ( 35 . ) .
although Bavaria got used to domin@@ ating the domin@@ ating game , Pi@@ re@@ aus could put into con@@ i@@ veness .
on the door@@ ke@@ eper , Manuel Neu@@ er was reli@@ ev@@ ing .
so about , when he had a shot of Ide@@ ye over the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of New Guinea , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola had to defend a quad@@ rant with David Al@@ aba in the centre beside Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it good .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero was first given after the final training session , Sport@@ front said Matthias S@@ ammer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought to King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the beginning of Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .

who ro@@ b has a higher risk , teeth to lose
those who smok@@ es , not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that puts a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study .
good news : if it fails to reduce the risk .
smok@@ ers have a significantly increased risk to losing their teeth early .
this emerged from the long @-@ term study of an international research team including several staff of the German Institute for Nutr@@ itional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) , Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking cases , in smok@@ ers , the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely to get the 2.5@@ - up to 3,@@ 6 times higher .
the scientists have observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
root causes for tooth loss , tooth dec@@ ay and inflammation of the g@@ gi@@ val , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these peri@@ od@@ ont@@ itis smoking is a risk factor , empha@@ size the authors .
therefore , the connection between smoking and dental loss therefore also tend to return to common tooth @-@ car@@ vers in smok@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no clar@@ ified either , to which smoking increases the risk of tooth dec@@ ay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who heard by smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years before the threat to the level of sm@@ oker @-@ sm@@ oker , the first author Thomas Diet@@ rich explained by the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people of them being smok@@ ers , non @-@ smok@@ ers , acting H@@ eine Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking does not shor@@ ten the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and also leads to good dental well being to the high age .
in Germany over 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of dental difficulties , the DI@@ f@@ E distributed .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increase the risk of early dental treatment .
the new long @-@ term study the be@@ holder .

to emp@@ ty@@ res the dispute over the planned transatlan@@ tic TTIP ( TTIP ) , the EU Commission has proposed comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private sil@@ encing facilities for disputes between companies and states are expected to be dis@@ solved by a transparent system which in its function is much more traditional cu@@ is@@ ines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to establish a system to di@@ gest citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the European Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ str√∂m today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sister did in front of bringing the proposal as a European negotiating positions in the free @-@ trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TTIP must develop the largest free @-@ trade area of the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the arbit@@ ration proceedings deal primarily states that the EU and the US can select an independent judges for a new investment plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they shall come to equal parts of the EU , the United States and from third countries .
scheduled for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to im@@ pose claims against jud@@ g@@ ments .
up to now , the displ@@ ac@@ ement involved in each other at the refer@@ ee , an obj@@ ection to their jud@@ g@@ ments did not exist .
in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens are not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fairness and justice , commented Malm@@ str√∂m .
in the long term , she wants to work according to its own data to an International Investment Court .
there could be clear differences between Chinese companies and EU countries for instance .
most of all the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration tri@@ umph ( IS@@ DS ) will be considered one of the main reasons for the big resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised as a kind of parallel to the companies above the tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws under@@ cut or lo@@ wering the reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first comments , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act signed the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate .
critic@@ ised above all that they are not supposed to apply for the free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic Secretary for Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) represented the plans in contrast as great progress .
the Commission considered the reform of key points that the Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked in the spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als be from the table .
the French government welcomed the plans of Malm@@ str√∂m .
the European Business Federation Business@@ Europe warned that the c@@ ement@@ ing of the economy has too many new rules to limit .
especially small and medium businesses could dis@@ advant@@ aged , it was called .
when the talks about the TTIP free trade agreements TTIP ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be completed on Wednesday on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since the middle of 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the topic investor protection has not been discussed with the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally a framework for the agreement was already at the end of this year .
this date is no longer valid .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n Deb@@ √ºt on the issue of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the issue of the Prime Minister with tension is anticipated
the new Labour Court of Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n was supposed to give his debut in the prime minister &apos;s question and for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six available questions shortly after mid@@ day , whereby its performance from the media is likely to be checked by the Americas and the Labour MPs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theat@@ res and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave his colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary exam for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s guidance , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow tra@@ ys and after his speech at the Tu@@ c Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the decision of the Labour chairman , on Tuesday during the singing of the National hy@@ m@@ ne , has prov@@ oked a memorial to the 7@@ 5th anniversary of Battle of Britain in silence , criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs , and is at the centre of several titles .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n decision , not to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ne , has attracted attention to himself
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; gotten &quot; in respectful silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ around of the Royal Air Force in Luft@@ schl@@ acht around England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two news@@ night program , he got to sing the Labour Chairman , the National hy@@ mn to sing , &quot; irrespective of his faith that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of the shadow &apos;s minist@@ ries have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s peak team , and they refer to differences in economics , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a Six@@ th of the Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary party was originally supported as leaders .
the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences also extends within the Labour Code , as well as Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns comments on the position of the European Union and the limitation .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the Tu@@ c @-@ Conference that the British changes put forward in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions ministers that the party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that it is only against the ruling plans to lower the limit of 26,@@ 000 ¬£ to 23.@@ 000 ¬£ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Committee Chair with David Cameron since he has been T@@ ory Chef , across the last decade to the Dis@@ patch Box@@ er in the parliament .
the Labour Chairman , who promised a new candidate , says he &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the issue of the Prime Minister is to a confrontation , and that he has under@@ gone both &quot; stroke &quot; and the Stre@@ its with contradictions and set out on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is represented , if he does not participate - for example , if Mr Cameron is on the road abroad .
he also brought the idea into discussion that other colleagues occasionally seize the word and that he talked about John Ber@@ co@@ w , the spokes@@ man of the house , talking to discuss the problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he became the leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron wants to w@@ ool himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister of the Prime Minister . but some years later he ad@@ mits that he has failed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since she was first sent on TV in 1990 , the question was seen with the Prime Minister as a major leadership and his leadership in the House of Commons and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliament@@ arians , although critic@@ isms may have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and has considerable @-@ reaching reforms .

the FT@@ SE 100 Index completed with an increase of 10 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover the ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .

the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; .
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied by Just@@ in yesterday .
including E@@ wa and Vik@@ toria in Poland .
in the morning , however , the cus@@ hi@@ ons is sitting on the cold stone board of the Berlin deluxe hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Bie@@ ber construction : here you d@@ well@@ eth I@@ do@@ l , whose poster are based in St@@ ett@@ in , since assembly evening .
the suite , in which the Canadian singer lives , will cost exactly as much as their mother E@@ wa earned half a year .

&quot; I met her a dream . &quot;
school light ?

also Bie@@ ber does not .
he has taken care of anyway .
for advertising in the advertising period of the super@@ bow@@ ls , he k@@ assi@@ ated three million , a two year deal with an anti @-@ Pick@@ el company , many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account .

PEG@@ IDA @-@ poster brings Leb@@ anese in the Pot@@ ato idea
potatoes or di@@ ers ?
it is both - and indeed in the Kartoff@@ el@@ d@@ eter , den der Ol@@ den@@ burger Imb@@ iss@@ land@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato instead of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the PEG@@ IDA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat con@@ gest@@ ed together to a sphere . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster to PEG@@ IDA demonstration with the ins@@ cription &quot; potatoes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen on TV at random . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then there is a barbecue which has been built with meat and potatoes .
&quot; that is multi@@ cultural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay .
the idea has now to leave the Leb@@ ese in Munich at the patent office in Munich .
here , according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as used for use by the authority .
how much meat and how much potatoes of the seed does not want to betra@@ y Al@@ h@@ ay is therefore not betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just as much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also with its customers the culinary international understanding comes well .
Met@@ cash laun@@ ches floor campaign to combat bal@@ di@@ - dispos@@ able
Met@@ adata attempts to protect the Ig@@ A Fili@@ p in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ alers Met@@ adata has launched a floor plan campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is opening the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , strengthen metals and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A by mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing about the social media on , as well as events such as Adel@@ aide Show .
Ig@@ A @-@ tra@@ ders and suppliers jump on board , with trademarks such as ic@@ iles of Simm@@ ern , of D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who sells out tickets for the South Australian football liga to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash released further details of its defense strategy on 29 September if the wholes@@ ale distributor for food , alcohol and devices leads to its annual investors strategy .
it is a lot at stake , since South Australia and Western Australia are almost 30 percent of met@@ e@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ shop shops and generate higher profits as a met@@ re@@ hs of Ig@@ A @-@ network in the Eastern states .
purchases in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ally provincial and ignor@@ am@@ ers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to some 14 percent in Eastern states .
however , anal@@ ysts do like Morgan Stan@@ ley that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its first markets cut away around five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
one in this week &apos;s report reported that Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Ig@@ A retail@@ er will lose 360 $ million in revenue per year and met@@ adata $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pre@@ diction is based on the assumption that Al@@ di is opened next year 25 locations in SA and 30 in WA , and generates sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food store and in the quantities of met@@ a @-@ high fixed cost @-@ basis could cost Met@@ cash around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the Eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan that ignor@@ n@@ ets are the most faithful .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ rac@@ hs are sales in the food and food store by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.@@ 1 percent in 2017 and 2,@@ 1 percent in 2017 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week told the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , during a business in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will likely disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash refused to respond publicly to the comments from Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is understood that a board member of Met@@ cash has been in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As &apos;s market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent , and supplies of met@@ ric food and food dealers , who has roughly 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A retailers in 2012 has fallen by 43 percent , which reflects the operative school building in con@@ ze@@ al pressure on revenues and mar@@ gins .
the wholes@@ alers is consumed rapidly and investing more than 150 million $ , to sales prices with CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ sen in hundreds of products each week for@@ getting the same and Ig@@ A retailers in improving their stores by fast growing fresh food and provide better choice of private label food products .
Met@@ cas@@ osh &apos;s leading business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adaptation and charging programs to Elan to establish and hopes that the wholes@@ alers will return to growth growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ akis is supported by President of the Australian tennis club Steve He@@ aly .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ akis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ akis was one of the &quot; col@@ ater@@ al flood &quot; within the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves more praise to the president of the austr@@ alian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather praise for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ k@@ akis , the younger of talented du@@ os , which is always called &quot; special K@@ s , &quot; caught by the ber@@ √º@@ ous engagement of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka at the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light .
in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ k@@ akis , and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison was to be separated twice through the refer@@ ee , where Har@@ rison was called , &quot; W@@ aw@@ bar@@ ka would have to hit with Kyr@@ gios , and I should hit the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how he crus@@ hed a tennis r@@ acket after fighting a potential US Open @-@ win by Richard Gas stop , Kok@@ k@@ akis was acknowledged by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ go@@ w , in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the single part of Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing about which I am quite ch@@ illy , is the fact that after my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi has been a little into the dispute , &quot; said He@@ aly .
he sh@@ attered a bat as he lost because of a struggle in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke a bat from fru@@ stration with itself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has been in the US Open extremely well , even among the quite pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot more recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around you , and I think he was treated a little too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard and he doesn &apos;t fit in the team and so on . he has never worked a problem with other players , he is well trained , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own accompl@@ ishments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also supported the decision to take full consideration when deciding on Friday and he describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he as@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to become a long @-@ term integral part of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely concentrated on the competition and not all the contro@@ vers@@ y around the contro@@ vers@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick felt very fast to the Ascension , and he pointed out all the criticism that he gets , but we try to support him . we try to reflect on the consequences of his actions . some time outside the struggle , in which he can only think about it , and it is best for the team and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declar@@ es emergency , closes the border , holding refugees
Hungary declar@@ es the emergency and sm@@ elled the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the firm who tried to get illegal in the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border , as hundreds of migrants joined in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and collabor@@ ated officials with rebel@@ lion .
the people who have fled from violence , st@@ acked for a unknown period in a land stri@@ pe on the road between the two check@@ points of the countries and built tents , and settled there .
but fru@@ stration wins .
as a police helic@@ opter about them , , the migrants &quot; Open the limit ! &quot; and rie@@ ve ins@@ ults against Hungarian polic@@ eman .
some instruc@@ ted to return from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ser@@ bian Foreign Minister said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants would be back from Hungary during more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral harm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days there must be talks with Brussels and other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica dac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the ung@@ ar@@ ally @-@ Ser@@ bian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nations block at a controversial meeting in Brussels , no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were looking for over @-@ over Italy and Greece . they pres@@ umed their hope that after all - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be agreed that the EU countries would take another 1@@ 20,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration rise of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary won &apos;t set his hopes for an established action between Brussels or its neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Emer@@ gency shelter in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to get out of the crisis , so that they could un@@ lock streets and accelerate asylum .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country has also stopped the construction of an ech@@ ino@@ UK market along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants by the country after having finished a fence at the Ser@@ b border .
C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ail@@ ments in the race , set up sp@@ ells between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a considerable delay in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East for a considerable delay and entrance to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , have passed that most of the in@@ coming economic migrants are , who are in search of a better life , and not war@@ ps , must be entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in contradiction with other EU countries , including Germany .
the new law , which occurred at midnight of Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the sh@@ ame@@ ful of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) heavy fence , which led the government along the southern edge to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher adhesi@@ on for being sentenced to human trafficking .
&quot; due to the situation that resulted from the mass migration , the Hungarian Government explains the state of affairs , &quot; said government speaker z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ ac Rep@@ or@@ ters in the southern City of Sz@@ eged .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the parliament must still agree that the use of the military still has to agree , which is expected for next week , but re@@ porter from Associ@@ ated Press will have already seen at the border to armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already for days .
Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , land @-@ security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities should cross 45 people to cross the border , 15 other were already penet@@ rated into the country .
they come down by damage the fence , they are now police @-@ protected and are accused of the desire of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are in the process of rep@@ airing the fence rapidly .
Hungarian officials concluded on Tuesday morning also two of the seven fron@@ tier crossing with Serbia , after a train car@@ gon with sc@@ atter@@ ing wire , to close the borders .
chaos conver@@ ged the main bor@@ der@@ line near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and op@@ pressing a crowd to push themselves up there .
about 20 managed to come , but thousands stayed outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another group of migrants did the main highway from Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
election 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ton &apos;s lead lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in the national survey
the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to last a double @-@ dig@@ it lead in the democratic race for nomin@@ ation at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins it towards floor .
Clinton has now provided support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the presidential elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is in second position , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice chairman Joe Bi@@ den who has not yet proclaimed whether he is calling for the presidential election , receives support for 15 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential election .
more than five months before the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates they are supporting .
but Clin@@ ton &apos;s supporters are more durable than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost in a number of demo@@ graphic groups while others recorded some gains .
Clinton has a big advantage with women and moder@@ ates , but these le@@ aps have less@@ ened .
their support in the men is significantly decreased , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points back .
Clin@@ tons advantages with democratic constitu@@ ents under 50 years has ev@@ apor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
Clinton has a big advantage with the older voters .
last month Clinton was particularly different with a double @-@ dig@@ it jump in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the presidential elections , they say that they would support the Clinton as they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some vessels and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprisingly , that Clin@@ ton &apos;s current supporters are mainly inspired by her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently does not support Clinton - only about a quarter I would love to assist .
while 48 percent of democratic voters have the presidential elections , Clinton had to support him with enthusiasm , say less Republi@@ can voters this about their head @-@ andi@@ daten Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clin@@ ton supporters in an open question asked why they want it to be the candidate , is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time for a woman &apos;s presidential system ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clin@@ tons of Clin@@ tons are also men@@ tions their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to the handling of problems and the constitu@@ ency are also cited .
as the Vice President Re@@ jects a potential for the presidential guard , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see it in the race - although a third believes it should not do it .
when democratic voters are asked for the presidential elections , those for the party would be their second choice is Bi@@ den at the top .
of Clin@@ tons trailers is more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
decide to channel Bi@@ des , not for the nomin@@ ation of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons cl@@ ashes before S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in betting on 30 points without him in the race .
five percent of democratic voters have seen Clinton as a candidate country with the best opportunities to win the election ; however , this number of 78 percent declined in the past month .
Bi@@ des is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that one sees it as the &quot; voting &quot; option .
nevertheless , in the question of what candidates are more important in candidates , call democr@@ at@@ voters questions about choosing .
similarly as in the last month no single democr@@ at@@ ant candidate or potential candidate for this voters of the presidential election is unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates make good results in some important characteristics of the presidential elections of their party .
they regard Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong gu@@ ide@@ als .
be@@ es cuts in three candidates best from honest@@ y , while Clin@@ ton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) but 27 percent do not believe in it .
democratic voters of the presidential elections also generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ite ide@@ ological in accordance with their views .
in all of these measurements , approximately a quarter of democratic voters has no idea of S@@ anders .
since questions about Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons use a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as an outdoor minist@@ erial post , most of the Democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections are pleased with their statement of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions altogether .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans now is dis@@ satisfied with their explanation while only one third is satisfied .
the public opinion of this subject was in March , shortly after the problem of light came , split .
most of the Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on their overall opinions from Clinton , although 36 per cent said that their opinion of her is still deteri@@ or@@ ated .
there are mainly rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their beliefs about Clinton had become worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trusted , this is still a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the vote entitled to vote is also not tru@@ ely and trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump will get some good notes at leadership .
from the six tested people cut Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best in honest@@ y .
a majority regards itself as being honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the Tro@@ ub@@ bu@@ g@@ ation for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the presidential elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son goes back close to Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is located on the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the two candidates , half of the voters will fall under the new survey , and others lose a fall dramatically . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ can voters support land@@ es@@ far continues to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support grows at 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted on the Fox News debate last month , at 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
however , Car@@ son was in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also yiel@@ ded the fact that Car@@ son arrives well in demo@@ graphic groups and trans@@ ump under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio govern@@ or John Ka@@ sich , is served with Wis@@ cons@@ in govern@@ or Scott Walker , who has fallen by 10 % support last month at now 2 % .
former Florida govern@@ or Je@@ b Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ark@@ ans@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio there are 6 % on third place .
the Tro@@ ub@@ ge in the sample of 3@@ 76 people by Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the newest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that car@@ son rises in the pol@@ ls - it lan@@ det at 19 % support in the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly before Car@@ son .
with a view of one in the last week of rising Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former Neuro@@ ch@@ ir@@ ur@@ gen , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ ze to face g@@ umps in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on the last Saturday during a campaign of campaigns in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;

five members of the Br@@ otherhood led to the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
almost two years after a student in a schi@@ ana ritual , as a student association in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , are filed against five persons .
members of New Yor@@ kers Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ der@@ schaft accessed by Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a intro@@ duc@@ tory period in September 2013 and consumed his transport to hospital , which has contributed to his death , the police declared .
officials said , he had been heavily stra@@ ined with a 30 @-@ pound k@@ nap@@ sack full of sand , and repeatedly had been attacked as he tried to as@@ sert regarding a frozen field on a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally wo@@ unded over head@@ aches , then he fell as@@ eless .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ otherhood does not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was impot@@ ent and wa@@ ited for an hour before they brought it to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ es clothes , his symptoms to goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Br@@ otherhood to get advice , called Poli@@ v@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members , Ut@@ ensi@@ lien began to hide and put the well @-@ being of Br@@ otherhood , basically over the by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ v@@ ef Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning to his injury .
after a car @-@ seventh time , Den@@ g have been repeatedly inf@@ lic@@ ted with de@@ ed force injury to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Br@@ otherhood . at least a student dies since 1970 every year at the Sch@@ ik@@ anen , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ mon Family represents , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; frat@@ ernity and its members must be held accountable , and this step by public authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County of Grand Jury of the Monroe recommended an indic@@ t@@ ment for the first five members .
two @-@ thirty members of the Br@@ otherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with the attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to be responsible for the people involved , but if there is an organization available - officially or officially - this is sanc@@ tioned by us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Br@@ otherhood , and the national Br@@ otherhood is to re@@ voke its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a fork Lift comes , and the house will fall into the ro@@ ver , Rend@@ ites for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into a recession .
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy provides only little instructions on the exp@@ ir@@ ation .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increased and lasted 86 months .
the aggression of the Federal Reserve while raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in doing the economy and the financial systems .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank strongly emphasises that investors should not concentrate on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end we could realize that the whole excitement due to a boost would possibly be exagger@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inev@@ it@@ ably be interpreted by some as a signal to the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the grad@@ ual return of the US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level in order to shine for the se@@ is@@ mic cord that seem to be many .
but this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a historical trend based look at how some areas of economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the stem from fork @-@ ups can make things for a while .
as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency that investments can be diver@@ ted from 12 to 24 months after the first increase in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank Analy@@ st in a newer study on what &apos;s happening in Zin@@ ser@@ rul@@ ings of F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
specifically , the market is usually in warmer - about 14 per cent - on the way to the fork Lift , rather flat in the 250 days after that ( average profit from 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal treatment in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 per cent according to a current analysis that Bob Squ@@ ee@@ en asset management , published by Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares may occur later in the boo@@ ster @-@ cycle and returns the return to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but inn@@ acle can often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is facing some conditions that not existed before and which a recession could accelerate .
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in a fork hei@@ ghtening of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , Deutsche Bank lay only twice the nomin@@ ale GDP since 1950 twice the nomin@@ ale GDP among 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , only few that this will last up and expect the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent .
Zin@@ ser@@ caves with such frag@@ ile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and throw the question as if this is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants have set the whole year into a fork of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the session of the Federal Open Market Committee in that week which ends on Thursday .
while many str@@ aps and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could have an increase in this session , the Fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study all the increases @-@ cycles have taken place in 1950 to today in a super @-@ cycle with growing momentum when GDP took place and before @-@ rec@@ essi@@ on@@ sh@@ √∂h@@ en is very quick after the start of recovery in the shadow , &quot; says this report .
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has so far been 74 months .
the firm income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , since the market opens a fork , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds can be faster than with shares when they change their strategic course .
at bonds , returns the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle occurs .
at the end of the boo@@ ster the bond bo@@ oms fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the str@@ aps of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in the interest rates will result in the result of the return between longer and shorter bond increases and lead to a down@@ force of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ speed bonds often bring better yiel@@ ds , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yiel@@ ds , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Anal@@ yst@@ ine near Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thinks Jones doesn &apos;t mean that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are a few signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more strict monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the population curve , cre@@ ten@@ se has gone up and the vol@@ at@@ ility has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed shar@@ pen its strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large and whole , companies that benefit the greater part of their business operations in the US , if interest rates are increasing and local products are more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
multination@@ als with high debts will become worse because a rising dollar spent their products on the global market and is also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quality - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares were extremely positive to respond to three months after initial fin@@ alisation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s anal@@ ysts in a report for the customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed results according to each of the Zin@@ ser@@ ums in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yield as well as low vol@@ at@@ ility in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will become a big problem .
company with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will most lose , said Gold@@ man .
outside of the EU companies , consumers can also benefit from the rising dollars .
as@@ parag@@ us could see profits by higher yiel@@ ds , even if experts are of different opinion how quickly this will happen .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says parliament@@ arians Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative member of the parliament critic@@ ized the radio because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wir@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is not able to differenti@@ ate from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also zi@@ pped on the BBC Music Awards and said that only The Br@@ its im@@ iti@@ ated
parliamentary colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins got the mission The Voice on and said that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , claim@@ ing a leading parliament@@ arians and raises new pressure on the radio station to prove that he does not do anything that does not do the private sen@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative , Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ ender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fool@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished by its commercial ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fro@@ ze &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to become Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards held in December last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which won last year , The Br@@ its seem to be under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General dire@@ ktor poli@@ ces back and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 far ahead of his commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and education about the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works in order , I also consider important &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder to put on the audience as it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 however was not the only element of BBC &apos;s production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport in order to step down the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins got The Voice on - the musical talent show of BBC , which was purchased from the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for at the expense of 22 million ¬£ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Fa@@ ith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; was produced in a special BBC manner . &quot;
he imp@@ lied that he is hoping that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one hit out of our in @-@ house st@@ alls &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if it star@@ ed the next time a entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to ex@@ clude the order of other rows of The Voice in the Future , or to add funds to don@@ ors for other sub@@ set formats .
internet con@@ vic@@ tories in August at the slow@@ est and black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven per cent increase in online selling .
last month the lowest result has been the lowest rate since the beginning of the records in 2000
online purchases increased three years ago by using mobile phones for sale
experts believe that black Friday in November has stopped their expenses
for over a decade , the virtual shopping m@@ ates has concentrated , and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have transformed itself into spirit @-@ related towns .
yet experts say that there are now signs that the online offset begins , after new numbers shown only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales st@@ agn@@ ant after new numbers shown only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developing throughout the time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sales , the Guardian .
he explained that the online sales had increased three years ago as a purch@@ aser , with their cell@@ phones purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now , this comm@@ utes the one and we may possibly experience that the growth decre@@ ases .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon which imported from America is being imported as a reason for the l@@ ass@@ ing revenues .
experts believe that buyers have their bought their purchases from this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year there were five times the average number of buyers to make their computers to make their bar@@ gain and some tra@@ ders cr@@ ashed away .
experts believe black Friday where the buyer has spar@@ ed buyers for bar@@ gain , buyers of them , to make shopping .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that from 5 ¬£ issues there was spent a little more than 1 ¬£ online .
with some products such as television and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now carried out by web@@ shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of the people are bought clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion cities in the interior .

an Arab version of the decre@@ e which was published by the State of Saudi press , said that the B@@ in @-@ Laden @-@ group was co @-@ responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail , however , that the company &apos;s leadership is forbidden to travel abroad .

the B@@ in @-@ Laden @-@ group has not published any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for an opinion .

since British employ increasingly cra@@ ftsmen to conduct hom@@ ey jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V√©ronique Lau@@ ry , new manager of King@@ fis@@ her who owns the Bau@@ markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified cra@@ ftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services at deep @-@ prices had now out@@ dated .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 more scre@@ en@@ fix shops , which connect to art@@ is@@ ans and 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said , she wants to take more wives in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten decisions in the shop are met by women .
at the moment , among the employees the men prevail .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single households , which make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we need to move this stronger towards one balance .
in principle , half of our customers from women with 80 percent of decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in making the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index registered company , has also re@@ stru@@ ed its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in management positions .
King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that has 45 percent of the team occupied with women , including management and financial status .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervis@@ ory boards .
King@@ fis@@ her applied a decrease in the half @-@ year &apos;s income and marks , after the group paid the costs of the barrier out of the stores .
because of the trends King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q possesses , 200 new locations open .
functional from A@@ me / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity
at the Landes@@ gericht Kl@@ agen@@ furt , on Wednesday we have responsible two function@@ aries of the Austrian vol@@ leyball @-@ vic@@ tor A@@ I / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and down@@ time .
the def@@ endants are not well known .
one of them had also been charged with Am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ sen .
in May he was acqu@@ itted of judgment in May .
the present process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to Ober@@ sta@@ ats@@ an attorney Robert Ri@@ ffel proved to be er@@ ected in preliminary exam@@ inations that accused the accused in the years 2006 to 2011 , mon@@ ies of the accounts held in their functions pre@@ dispos@@ able , for private purposes .
the damage was damage with around 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sports are also charged with financial services .
this fact was divided by the Chairman of the Sch@@ op@@ en@@ sen@@ ats , Rich@@ ter Michaela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
the defense of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity lay the defence , that the association was not com@@ prised a asset .
the sport@@ s@@ men would have only reck@@ oned compensation and the sport club that they would have spent much time and money in which they have spent much time and money in 2001 - the Passi@@ va bet@@ ru@@ ined in 2001 around 600@@ ,000 shar@@ ehol@@ dings ( approx . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then we were facing the situation : do we continue or lock the club or lock us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told one of the accused , in the ey@@ ro@@ vocation of the financial instrument . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he used to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did money , our life insurance as security in the bank had been defeated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the receipt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the association it was agreed : you can freely manage the money , not only a debt .
furthermore - in due to the financial - success the pay@@ out of compensation for un@@ fail@@ ures up to 1991 had been agreed .
therefore , one section of the pre@@ m@@ ations sold only years later , namely that the year 2003 , when a plus on the account has been paid .
therefore , the l@@ ump - and not detail sent on , explained the former Ob@@ man the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accounts and austerity were managed by the two def@@ endants in common , the second accused said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
why the pay@@ outs of the association was not detailed by the association , the judges asked .
the association has not been interested in detail for the financial geb@@ ar@@ ation , it is important to blame but the answer .
when in 2011 against the one responsible investig@@ ators began , an amount of 1@@ 20,000 euro was referred to the association onto the association .
that were appropri@@ ations , said the def@@ endants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this securities account went on the name of the second accused , and was not known to the association &apos;s statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; he wanted to know the judge .
clearly , the question asked for a long time .
then he said he finally did believe that this is the best for the society .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known something of that money , the prosec@@ ut@@ or presented in the room .
the collabor@@ ators had been informed , legally oblig@@ ated himself to the function@@ aries .
this transfer was formulated as a &quot; claim . &quot;
why in@@ dem@@ nity ? , wanted to know Lev@@ el@@ ist and prosec@@ ut@@ or .
then the first accused , he did not agree with this phrase , because the association was never faced any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom you are all out of the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function said , he never referred to a p@@ enny , he only calculated od@@ ometer and di@@ ets .
on diet coaching , he put up 1,000 Euros per month , but the actual expense was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not as@@ sign the accused .
these are after an operational testing , in which everything was judged correctly , no longer ret@@ ains it .
od@@ ometer also had the second def@@ endant taken up .
all the dom@@ est@@ ors were made in cash , in this case , he must drive from his residence international market to bank to B@@ lei@@ burg , he declared in his statement .
the main proceedings will continue with the survey of witnesses on September 23 .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard st@@ akes further 30.000 jobs

the US @-@ technology group is planning to reduce the reduction of 25,000 @-@ 30.000 positions in its creation .
in this way , costs amount to EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company shared the company on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of about EUR 2.7 billion that will result in the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs for three years has not yet been completed .
employees at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 still employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees .

R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke : violence in Ser@@ bian @-@ hung@@ arian border
the Hungarian police have used the Ser@@ bian border with R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ √§n@@ eng@@ as and Water@@ amps for several hundreds of thousands of refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ √°@@ ni@@ el Boz@@ si@@ k has experienced the violence broke out at the border control point .
he told me :
a group of refugees broke the border .
behind it had a police line @-@ line and behind the polic@@ emen stood a water@@ light .
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stone , sho@@ cks and plastic bottles by throwing the officials .
the officials initially set some pep@@ per@@ ation spray .
afterwards the police used Tr@@ √§n@@ eng@@ as .
much Tr@@ √§n@@ eng@@ as was spr@@ inkl@@ ed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dis@@ solved .
the refugees have gone a little bit down .
a pregnant and apparently the last wife was borne out of the zone .

time of decision on interest rates for the US emergency
the world is observed when the US emergency plate have come together to two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time ever since almost a decade of interest are raised or not .
a survey under 80 econom@@ ists who were asked by Reu@@ ters , found that a little more than half the last week of view was that the F@@ ed would do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed is still somewhat longer per@@ si@@ sted and interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0,25 % .
it is a historic event , since it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest was NU@@ LL in NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a major central bank may leave the zero field and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said angel U@@ bi@@ des , leader@@ boards at the par@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good performance level , tr@@ illion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate just a small inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less tricky outlook for global circumstances .
it has war@@ ns the markets to raise an increase , but the signs point out that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision to be announced at 20.00 h ME@@ Z on Thursday
death de@@ fle@@ e to the Delta State University lag@@ il@@ ised Ent@@ schul@@ dig@@ al
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later sh@@ akes his colleagues and k@@ issed Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb a note , to say that it &apos;s &apos; sorry to do with the first ass@@ ass@@ ination and wanted to &quot; he could make it impossible , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday .
the police at Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that Lamb , lec@@ turer for ge@@ ography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and said , he ro@@ de on someone and someone was killed .
Lamb told the staff of the not@@ ary that the police were sending police officers to his home .
he said , &quot; I sh@@ al@@ ted my wife yesterday evening , and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; were in the house , but nobody will be bot@@ her@@ ed , but probably be excited .
the police asked the call@@ ers according to his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no declaration of his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ un@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said , &quot; I do so sorry , I could do it back .
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb crossed 300 miles to Delta State University , where he discovered by E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killing him before he finally took his own life on Monday night when polic@@ emen took him around him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Universal President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said , he is nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supp@@ os@@ edly believed that she also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; Trinity . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was born by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said that she was married for about seven years than a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends remained .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss have had a daughter , which is 19 and they were wre@@ cked on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ un@@ iss .
K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss that had a dog named Light@@ ning , met for about three years with Lamb .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les
the police said , Lamb have ph@@ oned to any given time on Monday to tell them , &quot; he will not go to prison . &quot;
as polic@@ emen on the highway 1 near Green@@ ville later during that night , Lamb took his car to the side , flew away , ran into the forest and kill yourself with a shot .
Lamb received from the Delta State University from the Delta State University to receive a Doc@@ tor@@ ate at the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ poster : Lufthansa exp@@ ands the Group
Lufthansa is planning a big group construction .
half a billion euros a year wants to save the Lufthansa year alone with a better organisation .
150 of the world &apos;s about 1000 ex@@ ecutives will cost competitiveness in the Group .
with the Pilot@@ en@@ ge@@ werk@@ schaft makes it in@@ different negotiations .
Lufthansa is continuing to build its corporate structure and adds value to the endor@@ sed Euro@@ drawings .
the aim of the re@@ direction is a result of around 500 million euros a year from costs and revenue syner@@ gi@@ as , shared the airline in Wednesday .
among other things , there is no more board in the future for the passenger business in future .
the Billi@@ g@@ flu@@ b@@ ie Euro@@ door should therefore be developed as independent as possible .
at the head @-@ up team at the head of Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible in future by Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Euro@@ skull .
with the introduction of innovation , Sp@@ oh@@ r empha@@ sizes the significance of Euro@@ plans , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
to date , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the Flu@@ gl@@ in@@ ia belongs to the roof of the passage Air@@ line group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots

&quot; &quot; &quot; cock@@ pit plan to achieve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quick results &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a forecast margin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between union and air@@ line led to various strikes in the past months .
in addition to the trans@@ itional supply of the pilots the pilot concept is &quot; Wings . &quot;
it looks like Lufthansa in the fight against compet@@ itor routes to the Group &apos;s own Billi@@ gl@@ in@@ ie Euro@@ pra@@ ys .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play a monthly fre@@ t
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , which had a double fac@@ tion of his right foot .
while this has brought the left margin of the wine and ex@@ clude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al doesn &apos;t hope that Sha@@ w can play in this season once again .
the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H√©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the playground and needed oxygen before moving to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will leave tomorrow or maybe a day later and then in Manchester surgery .
it is horri@@ ble - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then it &apos;s going to be fantastic and then it happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cri@@ ed .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double fraction , then it will last six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy , to be a Red Card and the suspension of a claim .
Nicola Riz@@ z@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not pun@@ ished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had mist@@ aken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a mo@@ p @-@ meter and a red card were sus@@ cep@@ tible .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et of Sha@@ ws account recorded : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back stronger . &quot;
below : Manchester United will suffer the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat at the PS@@ V
the England def@@ ender has an additional incentive for Europe to come up with the European Championship in France .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves this kind of injury to place , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a sur@@ pass when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you then hear it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing that I could see was the ball that was travelling in another direction , so that it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I could not see the attack upon Luke .
in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ √©s Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost in@@ geni@@ ous .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child@@ book has decided to call the prime minister of The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 @-@ ene environmental f@@ us@@ el by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , to write Cameron in a message on the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I would like to read my children , because it always seems to have an image or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the next paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to re @-@ describe the action of the book , instead , re @-@ create a content of the movie version of 2012 , added the new characters and details to extend the pretty few original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all the nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , hoping to see a real tree with his desire to see a real tree , his real name Theod@@ or Se@@ uss host@@ el lau@@ ded and who died in 1991 but is completely unknown .
as if this was not yet suspic@@ ious enough : the text presented by Cameron speaking , partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , where everything is arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity it hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Audre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits that Cameron is to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely to be familiar with the action of the book as little familiar . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment through the yel@@ lowing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ enden , sn@@ aky creatures , &quot; which says in the name of the trees , &quot; spoiled .
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a volunteer who has not read The Lor@@ ax a 20 time in a child .
a down@@ ing Street @-@ speaker said that the text was probably released by Camer@@ on &apos;s election firm .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ ons employees there was no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened from the exclusion from England &apos;s team but it is still difficult
to reach Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if one has chosen the Ka@@ der , the England for the tour , is a repe@@ ating of the 3 @-@ 0 Test @-@ hat@@ s@@ ary defeat is not on my map .
I would not have an exit win .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will be carrying no s@@ cars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball develops Mo@@ een Ali as a spin@@ er and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown dimensions in the test level , is an option for the attack .
in this endeav@@ or , Adam Ly@@ th goes out of the England Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced with Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to let Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his chief trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that crime players are oriented towards results .
there were no question mark upon Joe Roo@@ t , for example , and this led to the nomin@@ ation as - and I said this - players will have their own best choices .
long ago , it had extended the course of Ly@@ ons , but he had control over his own destiny .
if he hopefully defe@@ ating more acquis@@ itions for Yor@@ k@@ shire , comes another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not get so good performances , and he did not surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question how much time a test stroke will get to get his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton 9 got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance of home and cont@@ enders .
the only accus@@ ation that one can rise up was that England had first performed Jonathan Tr@@ ott in the Caribbean when it was Ly@@ th in high@@ form - but this lost chance now lies in the past .
alex H@@ er comes in and he is a stroke , which I p@@ ours high .
he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ ist , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season , when he obtained 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which met us very much .
he has to receive at least the same chances as the before him , but this depends of course on the teams in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat Mo@@ een beside Cook , which would bring an extra spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and four cross@@ icks then , di@@ pped up , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a stroke will not hit there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een might not be doing his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is it a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he re@@ signed in 2001 as Open@@ er .
he made a hundred of us immediately and looked like it .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari is coming to the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up Sp@@ inner , and in my limited way he was very impressed with me as a young man .
people may see its statistics - average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt but there is no large number of backup Sp@@ inn@@ s which rise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
aside from the team England has made a few smart additions at the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Sin@@ awar@@ a , the Bat@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master@@ coup .
he is one of the nicest guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience since it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white pel@@ let phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application into the setup .
I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as co@@ aches , and how Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even though the news can be in line with the previous mess@@ enger .
col@@ ous team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben Stok@@ es , is not used for One @-@ Day@@ ers , Em@@ t received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team@@ players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as they depend on players their jobs of the results .
such decisions are not made easy at the heart .
the Bre@@ xit @-@ bearing ( Bre@@ xit = Ex@@ ternal Great Britain from the EU ) could win to Zul@@ u if the economy by 2017 is in a fin@@ e@@ fold
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ ne@@ ve@@ able strategy to keep Britain in the EU , will fall deeper into trouble with each day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the Tu@@ c , which was viol@@ ently crus@@ hed across Europe by Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European Diplom@@ acy and she said that some member states , so deeply stri@@ pped into various crises , as the EU is now and not always out of their own gu@@ ilt , Great Britain itself , with shared conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing agreements , which they usually do not want to be filled .
in Brigh@@ ton , the Tu@@ c decided on their annual meeting , that it does not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se the social protection .
we could call it Dave and Georges Self@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister are climbing up on meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they will gain h@@ orts for reforms .
it is always about me .
my European friend , who wishes an outdoors in the interior of the EU tent - &quot; lecture left us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials came up to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an association , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them , as it has happened in the exagger@@ ation like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France Fran√ßois Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election as well as his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a bl@@ ass@@ ing force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain has a left wing .
it falls difficult to imagine that they will get a leg to help the self @-@ ee British to better get their energy better for Scotland &apos;s ex@@ iting from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar physical tendencies have .
so , maybe some such ministers may even be purpos@@ ely not helpful note , throughout the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ um campaign to speed the Bre@@ xit process , thought my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won anything of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how often the Fle@@ et Street can be at its expense and which EU sc@@ ep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the pressing bure@@ au , but not they were not supported by Tony Ben@@ n to an inspiring contribut@@ or in 1975 but not that our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 supported .
you can remember weak on Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro Opport@@ ists who has made a name to be a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ald ban@@ anas &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ year .
with all its ver@@ zin@@ ess knew Ed Mili@@ band who were his enemies .
this includes the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing hel@@ pers , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ able foreigners and the p@@ seudo @-@ foreigners who possess most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air was thinking about her , but concluded that if you &apos;re sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a c@@ age , one is better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as the Bl@@ air itself when he was ref@@ ra@@ ined by Camer@@ on refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms@@ wir@@ bel because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of the not passed Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who opened it into an back door .
the press has never twi@@ sted him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me on Monday in Westminster a friendly sla@@ p on the back - I told him that he didn &apos;t have time for me to waste the need - seems to repeat in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ spe@@ c years , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa was left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position about Europe is - I express it very friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a reform@@ ierte EU .
now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps , traditional leaves tendency and the wil@@ der sk@@ il@@ ds of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ English is probably everyone to say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n , on the radio and television this week said , when the boy sc@@ outs were fighting in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ vo@@ zier@@ end John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ s , when his old father made his efforts on TV , to be loyal to his Labour cabinet , without going too far and to lose his cabinet .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys fight was even more attractive .
but to fight , &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , yet what J@@ C said to his comrades and members following all reports on their cl@@ ause on Monday night .
whatever the tou@@ ching Bot@@ tom @-@ Up Image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey this fact that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the Stru@@ c@@ als of Social Media , a brut@@ alization of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ en@@ pen@@ it@@ ching campaign for granted , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins will surely think so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n basic ambig@@ u@@ ity for EU membership - in accordance with her Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ er@@ ungs @-@ economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left sea @-@ presi@@ dents , for which the Nar@@ cis@@ si@@ sm@@ us of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic dispute .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is fel@@ low@@ fest convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be oblig@@ ated to try to find in everything a sense of their sen@@ iors .
why should Paris or Berlin require political capital - they also have mix@@ er voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British when this can be anything meaning@@ less ?
the US has already been quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was rec@@ alled when starting on Monday , British Inf@@ lu@@ ence Security Forum called .
experts crit@@ ici@@ ze report from Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking was formed from a meeting of 12 persons , partly with ties to the tobacco industry , told researchers .
experts who are writing in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined The Lanc@@ et by critic@@ izing the post of Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have asked the resi@@ li@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptionally wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he founded his most important conclusion on the p@@ he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; on stone or sand build . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public is expected that the pret@@ ensions of p@@ he that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of post @-@ wise and modeling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were appointed to develop a model for multi @-@ specific criteria ( multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to bring their opinions about the damages from different ni@@ cot@@ ine inhal@@ ed products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose leaders had previously received British American Tob@@ acco resources ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants stated at the meeting called funds from a e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing that he should have received after reports previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not delivered , but includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes rop@@ es , some of which also include a sector financing in paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting there was also the tobacco leadership of p@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stun@@ ned be@@ ard@@ ently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products at most criteria , &quot; wrote to Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the asser@@ tions of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes can serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he , said that on the asser@@ tions of BM@@ J was re@@ acted before .
he said , &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful to smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smok@@ ers dies at its ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggest that health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes compared to that minor , but that we continue to have long @-@ term effects to study .
p@@ he has the unique duty to inform the public about what evidence is evidence and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion over relative haz@@ ards in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually at a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system two billion ¬£ per year .
by clear focal point of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not lacking any risk , but only a fraction of damage that is caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should aband@@ on East@@ En@@ ders , says the former Chief of Channel 4
the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; will give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the fee will be used only to make the type of programs sent by other UK radio .
he critic@@ ized the BBC that they will probably be seen public @-@ legal programs , which probably should be seen by a smaller audience , in hard to place the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he has tried for six years at his time at Channel 4 with a success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs got or sends , which were also clearly demonstrated by un@@ conventional Riv@@ ets , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee in the context of his investigation about the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the Rund@@ funk@@ fee , what I do not consider mid@@ - or long @-@ term , not for a good idea , one should give his production at least on programmes that others do not or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class window , because they want to get the possible support for their future as possible .
the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it is ridicul@@ ous , it is natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why it financed a ra@@ ve tax programs which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both original productions .
honestly , other channels would give their right arm to it .
I we@@ ary to see how this should be public @-@ law@@ ful television .
I don &apos;t think that this would dism@@ iss the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for the series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said , said that the BBC has to blame on the hunt for reviews &quot; due to the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts will be back , what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ conference talk in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs to go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure up the audience , and they can argue if they go to their seem@@ ing sacred missions to the just@@ ification of 4 billion ¬£ / radio rate , &quot; Well , of course , we have seen all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window of time , in which no one ever wanted to see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the venue Johnson said to the Committee , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions which can receive the best value to this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you think all that you get a great value for 150 pounds per year here but for guys who is for ¬£ 150 a lot of money , ask me if that is true because they do not consume much from the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission . &quot; to inform and maintain . &quot;
he said , just little by the BBC production would now officially classi@@ fy as education - he said it was 1 % of their TV @-@ production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example of this in &quot; inform , clarify and enter@@ tain this . &quot;
to the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , from which he said , that only a handful of television will be shown , and in the commercial sen@@ ders alliances in order to make everything available online .
&apos; Son@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; can control brain cells through sound @-@ waves
the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ o@@ des change the direction in the moment in which they can be radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bre@@ d wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified ne@@ ural systems , which can be controlled by break@@ through@@ s of sound @-@ waves .
the tiny Nem@@ at@@ o@@ des change the direction in the moment , in which they have the sound @-@ impul@@ ses which have for the human hearing too high frequencies to be heard , radi@@ ated .
the impul@@ ses are working through the switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und @-@ waves .
further to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new process , called Son@@ ogen@@ etics , where ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La Jol@@ la , California , said the Guardian of one day to replace the depths in brain stimulation that gives electric stim@@ uli into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
F@@ ic@@ e@@ ers usually do not respond to ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bu@@ bb@@ les .
the bu@@ bb@@ les , he found out , reinforce the ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
the intensi@@ fication ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels and are found in the membran@@ es of some of the lit@@ ters .
the sound waves move the opening of these volunteers and activate the cells that they are assigned to such a report Nature Communications .
to create ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und Scre@@ at@@ oda , changed chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons contribute to TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels .
if he turned ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und on the changed creatures , the sound waves are reinforced by the micro@@ bes and transferred into the wor@@ ms , where they swit@@ ched to the altered mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a ground @-@ breaking tool , enabling scientists to integrate and turn around neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ etics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that has to be sent to an optical fiber in the desired place in the brain , Ni@@ ed@@ rig@@ ation tran@@ ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und tissue can happen and can be sent so into the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and therapeutic virus it is possible to post@@ p@@ one the specified human neur@@ ons temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for life in student dormit@@ ory
eleven years ago I moved to a student dormit@@ ory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those who I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ day complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student dormit@@ ories ranges from slightly nerve rac@@ king up to absolutely horri@@ fic .
it is temp@@ ting to hur@@ ting : people tell where you come from where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly say Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract h@@ ah@@ aha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Make questions and show interest .
it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you to find out people who like you would not speak to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes were in fire and this fire ext@@ ingu@@ ishers .
allow people .
the rooms of people often transform themselves in beverages , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people move and their under@@ garments buy .
referred to here : do not remember to begin at the university with a relationship
Int@@ ro@@ ver@@ ted received a grave treatment at the university .
their room should be a refu@@ ge , yet many student dormit@@ ories form a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ cav@@ ity culture , which can be friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be the hell for someone who is trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I will say that our friendship goes on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy back for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a cl@@ it@@ ones is exhausted from con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead .
A@@ prop@@ os refu@@ ges : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ory had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship with b@@ aking .
as you start the Uni at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ie , the monastery is present at the doors of people to present themselves with a dish full of brow@@ nies , less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have made you something to smile . so , and now please smile if I give you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade cakes are a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your ro@@ omm@@ ate will feel oblig@@ ated to keep themselves enter@@ t@@ ained and will end your face with a delicious surprise in the end .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad mixed cl@@ ump from flour , sugar and fat lead to people to as@@ le@@ ep when you d@@ elling .
ste@@ al food is a common crime in student dormit@@ ory .
of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check that with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say themselves to serving themselves , even if they bo@@ il in the inside .
if anyone ste@@ als your bel@@ ong@@ ings , this is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it well as my ro@@ omm@@ ate , added to their milk a so@@ ap to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise , people sleep from sleep or work .
it &apos;s not only about being a decent man but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b to the men who are sitting in the glass house .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours to ask them something , Drum &amp; bass something le@@ ak , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted to it with more clim@@ ber music .
when she finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , she left her neighbors with friend@@ liest couple of hours before they left their own music , closed her door and settled in their three @-@ hour examination .
would it be not romantic if your future spouse would happen to be acci@@ dental into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it would not be too embarrassing for you to keep a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future sp@@ ouses , to separate themselves and to experience it every day and maybe to experience how to get all together shared friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own paths - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future sp@@ ouses , try at least to speak your d@@ lei@@ b a little reason .
in the exciting moment , in which you notice that somebody has its keys in his not cur@@ ted room , the border between a Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing f@@ one when it seems .
a good name is funny , but it only takes moments when it becomes the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
pit@@ falls you by del@@ etes a valuable and am@@ using layer on safety - but never di@@ gest someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
shut your door , and place their keys in a glass of water which you then put into free@@ zer - but give your poss@@ essions on the ceiling no longer than twice .
ter@@ rac@@ ed houses for refugees , all@@ deser@@ ters , stra@@ igh@@ ting ear@@ ners
the property contrac@@ tor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the Central @-@ Frank@@ ish paved area for people who have not much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , approximately for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need motor@@ homes , but also the only educated mother and the stra@@ igh@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am showing how to do still cheap and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year old in the interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees shall push for the living market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly the living room can be created : it builds in a project of ter@@ rac@@ ed houses for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees shall push for the living market .
what solution offer you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass accommodation in containers or Turn@@ h@@ allen has no sustainability .
because people remain a great part here .
in view of the refugee stream , we need enough housing in the decades to come .
a very ban@@ ales , dirty fri@@ gate @-@ detached house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a park @-@ detached house needs the least place .
it makes it easier to integrate .
this is different if people under@@ go people in housing .
each of the six houses that are being built straight in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say , it is again peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be modified according to the needs .
how much are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per home rises on 184 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months of construction has taken place .
this is appropriate .
do the basic rules have to complicated their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the legally right I have brought my project correctly .
it &apos;s always complicated , it always makes the dro@@ pping D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ isation promotion and the space @-@ space .
gr@@ us@@ ly .
it is still under@@ estimated , who creates three apartments in a park @-@ designed house , needs at least three pitches .
only in cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants react to their Rei@@ h@@ enhaus project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were the ones who have thrown to me , super@@ built for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not true .
but do not tigh@@ ten the competitive battle for paid apartments ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true : we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but were built @-@ suite apartments which can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees but also the only educated mother or the stra@@ igh@@ ter .
I am showing how you can still find cheap and good things today .
it is about that .

this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple made this impro@@ b@@ able by making the update far more likely . likewise , it will be easier to do so when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is completed .
it &apos;s worth to make sure your mobile phone is charged while updating or is located near a charging one , so the battery is loaded .
when the charge is too low , Apple does not leave that the update will be continued , since the phone may possibly change half way , and this might lead to a dis@@ ruption of the updates .

Dr. Frank M√ºller takes over practice Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and invested 310@@ 000 Euro
Silvia M√ºller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank M√ºller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen .
we are also looking forward to Sam@@ t@@ common @-@ Master Bernd Bor@@ mann , Economics in Uta S@@ eim @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places in the countryside doctors are still lacking in doctors - As@@ endorf against it : there will be Dr. Frank M√ºller on the 1st of October the practice in Fel@@ ste@@ ausen on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen is reti@@ ring at the retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his successor for the next few months with half a spot .
after a radical phase , M√ºller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he is investing 310@@ 000 Euros to the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when Frank M√ºller and his wife Dr. Silvia M√ºller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll has met with Dr. Silvia M√ºller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who are currently serving their professional education in the company &apos;s hospital and commented on to come into practice .
&quot; we always in mind that the gar@@ bage would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was done , I just called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
couple M√ºller liked the idea of operating the own practice in future in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old M√ºller .
&quot; we would like to meet and accompany the families across the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he can see his own boss too .
and so it was unified , the gar@@ bage bought the house with the practice .
living they will continue to be in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen Vil@@ sen .
there is the doubt family grandfather Frank M√ºller also grown up , his Medi@@ z@@ inst@@ udi@@ um in Hannover four stations in several medical offices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a secondary in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed for the leading staff in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in volunteers in the DR@@ C @-@ read@@ iness Bru@@ ch@@ hausen .
as of 19 September the practice for the new Chief is prepared .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ste@@ ausen was working as a company doctor , his wife has specialised in Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in ) to the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as home@@ work .
&quot; die End@@ os@@ kop@@ ie comes therefore out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia M√ºller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after re@@ modeling the rooms will look like modern .
we will offer more ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und investigations as well as long @-@ term - and durability @-@ EK@@ GS and need a consultation with more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a grant from a total of 500@@ 00 Euro received the gar@@ bage dump in the framework of a convey@@ or programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and by the Sam@@ t@@ gemein@@ de ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and we are glad that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes Zambia Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 2000 patients come according to Silvia M√ºller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll every quarter in the practice field , in the North German average practice they are about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another house practice office .
a positive effect @-@ effect of the practice transfer by Frank M√ºller : the pharmacy remains noisy to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor was found it would have gone .
who visited who M√ºl@@ lers &apos;s Expert , the inci@@ dentally continues to be trusted faces : takes care of the seven medical professionals and cleaning the cleaning of the Fel@@ lows .
with its part@@ ing ends in As@@ endorf an era , after all , the medic@@ s have practiced 30 years there .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; rec@@ alls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen in mun@@ er@@ ating .
a little sad@@ ness made it after the long time already .
&quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients will certainly still see , &quot; says the Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband comple@@ ments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 @-@ square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I always pushed myself against hor@@ ti@@ ck@@ work , but now that could become different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , the pair has two grand@@ sons and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also driven at our border line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said In@@ minist@@ erin Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border must remain er@@ ect at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; still it is clear that everyone who wants to issue a asylum , this could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the provision and safety of the human being stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s clear that it needs significant signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minist@@ erin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept lim@@ it@@ less migration flows , even not on the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia &apos;s plans to continue to travel towards Austria and Germany and would also to cor@@ rid@@ ors cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
in this way , the Minister of the Ves@@ na Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach does not look .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia is rather the surveillance of the borders - particularly into Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled by the border of the Schengen area .
like the minister stressed that the Slov@@ ene in doing so does not want to avoid the borders of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried in the evening hours to the Tuesday to travel in Ost@@ ro@@ usa at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to avoid the registry .
the Croatian police could take her on the nearby ma@@ is@@ fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has constantly met police vehicles with new refugees .
it is primarily about Syrian and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in action .
in the next days , his country with around 4000 refugees , said Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
moreover , buses from Pres@@ evo would have brought to the Maz@@ ed@@ on@@ isch @-@ Ser@@ b border that led to the Hungarian border so far , reported Croatian and Ser@@ bian media on Wednesday , reported Croatian and Ser@@ bian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Belgrade are denied however that it would be people to make certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we do , nor want it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reporting , in any case in the morning , a first bus had arrived with around 50 refugees in the Ser@@ b border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day more buses were expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers had been the whole night of the approximately 500 kilometres distant ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border through Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made , so the police told us that we should be driving here , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel back to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , it could actually launch the shifting moving of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ western route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for bound@@ ary control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior ministers O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stated that his country has prepared for the case of a strong inf@@ est@@ rogen of refugees corresponding plans for possible ex@@ itu@@ tion situations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call it but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has comprehensive possibilities for fron@@ tier control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lead strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners once again place a good testimony concerning the standard of border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on ser@@ b@@ ic side behind the Hungarian Gren@@ zer shell continue to be approximately 300 refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reporting they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os that leads to R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two fron@@ tier transfers Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to be completely locked .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Ser@@ bian Minister of N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to re@@ assure his involvement in Hor@@ g@@ os early in Hor@@ g@@ os : he has concluded the debate on alternative measures of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not at this time be very high refugee numbers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could not be said whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers of migrants to - dangerous - alternative v@@ rou@@ ten
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee camps have already begun to distribute refugees on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless . in some parts of the bor@@ der@@ land , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian case , there is still not enough min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police declared that a team was sent by Min@@ en@@ r√§um@@ er in the border region .
listed @-@ h@@ acker : Ukrainian pay 30 million dollars
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard a ring of cy@@ ber criminal off@@ ences that have ever been thrown back into yet un@@ released financial reports and press releases on websites such as business Wire , marketplace , and PR News@@ wire . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the use of the information , insi@@ der stores should have been made on the financial markets .
in this way , investig@@ ators were reported a total of more than 100 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately taken tr@@ apped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the processes against 32 other accus@@ ations were in the case digest@@ ed .
most of the def@@ endants come from Ukraine and Georgia .

the conduc@@ tors of the ec@@ umen@@ ical h@@ os@@ pice aid is also available for questions and discussions as well as the volunteer employees .
during a pas@@ ant , spont@@ ane@@ ously , towards chal@@ k , and the phrase , &quot; to read my life , &quot; to stop the war , &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t suffer too long , &quot; to read phr@@ ases such as &quot; as far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again , on the ver@@ ge , there are little discussions about the action in itself , about life , dealing with death .
Peter H√º@@ b@@ inger is also on site .

therefore , this public awareness for 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards , be understandable , ultimately it is a very personal matter .
the subject of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine L@@ ammer is al@@ beit a lot about the h@@ os@@ pice movement in recent years to open up the people .

Fed@@ Ex has launched a decline in the international ranking shipping in recent years that brought the sales in its unit express shipping .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and insurance .
the express unit cho@@ oses higher income due to higher rates , whereas the result was due to higher labour costs in the freight .
in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before opening , the Fed@@ Ex @-@ shares at 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,15 $ .

on their most anticipated session in the years Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ egen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time since almost a decade up@@ lift the benchmark .
Dro@@ h@@ end about them at the end of the sold , two @-@ sto@@ rey seat sa@@ als is located a m@@ ural of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ Chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall put the economic interests of the nation to all the other things .
the Central Bank has a tw@@ ined order of Congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices are stable here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that it is an un@@ failed third mandate - financial stability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ di@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to get acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the unprecedented short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data from the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence affecting the global financial markets that have already cau@@ ti@@ ous f@@ ed representatives , these vol@@ at@@ ility is increased by raising interest to federal bonds - and whether it is only about 1 quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important thing that they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if searching for an exc@@ use were not to increase the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough just@@ ification , continuing to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing , which sec@@ ures itself to the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were asked recently by Bloomberg have predicted that week predicted that week .
the financial markets however expect a dra@@ ining of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline of the stock market , unless the F@@ ed increased the sentence unless the shr@@ inks are sm@@ ashed , by promising the impact that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value at 22@@ 8.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % on 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed politics continues the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would lift the sent@@ ences at this stage , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she needs to go very far in her statement to so@@ ak the financial markets so they do not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a interests would calm the financial markets because they force the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
just a month ago the F@@ ed appeared on a good way to increase the set around 0.25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of mon@@ et@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in Spring and early summer , that in this year , despite the complaints from Liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement in the labour market this year was solid .
the unemployment rate declined to 5.@@ 1 % in the past month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level which sees the F@@ ed as full employment .
wage delays have shown signs of recovery .
and although the inflation constantly ran below the goal of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary impact of a significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but financial markets around the world do@@ cked together at the end of the last month after China had evaluated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage fell in May at more than 16 percent among its peak performances , as investors feared that a slow@@ ing of the Chinese economy would be the global growth of th@@ rot@@ ary .
the market has recovered , in this month , although the D@@ ow is now around 10 % below the test@@ icle of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market tum@@ ul@@ ent affect the complex lim@@ ati@@ zation as to increase interest .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of Chinese economy has not occurred in the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. Emer@@ gency .
now , he pre@@ di@@ ct that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore they should not be included in their decision @-@ making process .
in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
the mere note of the then Ben S. Bern@@ anke in the year 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expansion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ext@@ ingu@@ ished turbul@@ ence around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly flowing with each other , from the F@@ ed representatives , they can not only monitor developments in other locations , but also by other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ari@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the global strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ heads to financial market movements that appear with the apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
L@@ acker , atmosph@@ eric member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to a Zin@@ c heights , econom@@ ist decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its benchmark around 0,75 percent@@ ages in three sessions &quot; despite limited recogni@@ zable impact on growth in the USA , &quot; said L@@ acker .
a year later the F@@ ed @-@ Represent@@ atives made these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis like the first re@@ unification 2008 , Adam S. Posen , former member of the Committee on the interest of the Bank of England .
the most recent tur@@ mo@@ il do not come close to this plane , he told .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly wants to not get into the situation where they are afraid of a fork Lift , because the markets stands out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pozna≈Ñ , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t believe they should av@@ ail the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small living aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany during these days .
to prepare you a warm welcome , not without the commitment of un@@ involved volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are quite a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
to them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
even with their 74 races they are taught .

Brasi@@ li@@ ens p@@ √§@@ di@@ at@@ rische Gesellschaft Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian di@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to im@@ pose on sho@@ cking way women on sho@@ cking the importance of good nutrition during the lact@@ ation period . she does this with the presentation of images of babies , who are painted at Bruges , which are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that babies give all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are set to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ ory procedure would not be the only di@@ at@@ tic adaptation that the mothers should be made .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet can fluctu@@ ate women from their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can influence the immune system negative .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
der Gemein@@ der@@ at Bern@@ ried approved the construction fee for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof should be mounted for solar system .
the plann@@ ers for the long lon@@ ged sport ber@@ cycl@@ or@@ ship at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ clubs are proceeding step by step : in the recent meeting session , the elabor@@ ated project was un@@ blessed without great discussions .
before , the Panel had decided , among other things , another application for the &quot; f@@ og@@ ative &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid modeling plan .
in the &quot; exception &quot; it was for permission for a special form regarding the roof construction .
therefore a &quot; pan@@ try should be built with non @-@ mit@@ ous First and Dach@@ stein . &quot;
in the background of the planning is the proposed use of the roof for solar systems : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large south @-@ roof , &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Liber@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in turn , it went on a pit@@ ching , which should be made from energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan - under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Liber@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan is not permitted to allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Gemein@@ der@@ at usually occurs rather restric@@ tive when it comes to liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , when the re@@ ver@@ ber@@ ing structure , this is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we therefore create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Turn@@ hall@@ en@@ bau at Sports Centre is a collabor@@ ative project in the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
at the expense are some 2.3 million Euros .
supplements are expected by school and long@@ itude promotion .
in the next process , the construction fee is presented for the 18 x 36 meter large hall now for the review meeting .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ mb@@ berg will be closed sooner than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as Director of Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees are moving from P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these shows the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , the Land@@ s@@ √§t@@ in Andrea Joch@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü confirmed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there will be a decision on the agenda of the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board , and the foundations for next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the plans are implemented , all of the barely 50 employees were continuing to hospital in P@@ ei@@ mb@@ berg .
the vast majority shall diver@@ t with fishermen and the further existing interior station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees that can not be offered to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a job in W@@ eil@@ heim , says Joch@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü .
the employees are informed of the plans .
triggered by the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the course of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic and has now swit@@ ched to a private office on the hospital stay of hospital .
the question of who is to pursue the conf@@ ession went according to Joch@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; in the game , who agreed to take over from 1 October to change direction and to change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in any case a &quot; recording &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area of &quot; internal medicine , &quot; says Joch@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü .
fishermen are a specialist in heart @-@ based and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the interior station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses .
trans@@ itional for the next two years , fishermen with his team , if the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board will bring both homes , till then next year the former Hospital of the k@@ app@@ y , which still has 35 beds to be closed in P@@ ei@@ mb@@ berg , after nearly 140 years .
so far the land@@ circle had planned this for 2018 if the ongoing recovery in the hospital was completed in W@@ eil@@ heim .
Land@@ scape IM @-@ Wei√ü , who also has chair@@ man@@ ship of the board of the board , came to the rum@@ ors that the house which is owned by the federal government , will in future be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to continue with the property , Joch@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü couldn &apos;t say there are several reflec@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a meeting spaces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did not happen to us , such an occasion will not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as fishermen about the Qu@@ asi @-@ Mo@@ ve to the Le@@ ch who have been received by the staff &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house , which has been a veter@@ in@@ arian for over 30 years , have not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take the post of medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ mb@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was always under threat from closing times , for example the surgery and the g@@ yn@@ a@@ ecology .

the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found at the Tuesday evening in rock@@ enhausen at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ution and police on Wednesday .
as a tat@@ ran@@ ate , another 20 @-@ year @-@ old is also regarded as stated 20 @-@ year old , who stated that reason and the investig@@ ator carried out to the discovery of the bodies .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported by Sunday on Sunday after she did not come home after a visit to a fall in Rock@@ burg .
in his search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first hit the personal objects of the victim .
in surveys in the friend and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the mixed , finally a pa@@ au@@ ion came up against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the mut@@ ine@@ ous perpet@@ rators then led the police to a channel in rock@@ enhausen where the bodies were found .
the det@@ ain@@ ted were reported to the authorities in the police trial , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and the cor@@ pse have placed in the canal .

refugees need accommodations : study aler@@ ting in front of d@@ ut@@ ch
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
again and more refugees seek a pay@@ able bolt .
pressure on the housing market grows .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since began .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market which is now over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you compete with income @-@ making citizens for the last paid apartments .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , would have to be built up to 2020 each year 400@@ ,000 new units .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to this result , a study is about to order the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Building &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the comparison : this year is finished in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units .
so there are 14@@ 0,000 apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated after the first three months of their stay than asylum seek@@ ers in an initial week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many come across the apartment market and go into the long sn@@ akes in front of the flats .
according to the Statist@@ ical Bundes@@ amt , however , in the last year , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers are available .
the negative development of the housing point is however not only due to the rising wave of refugees .
the study also makes significant reductions in the resi@@ dual policy of recent years .
Germany seemed to be a housing defic@@ it that gets bigger from year to year .
currently missing in the metro@@ politan areas already approximately 77@@ 0,000 dormit@@ ories , Matthias G√ºnther , author of the study .
many professionals have therefore lived in big cities , not@@ ing in both WG rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults were continued for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the large cities the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has fallen in the first time in the past years .
to solve the problem , the alliance &apos; is propos@@ ing a new start .
thereby , new incentives should boost the social housing construction again .
so could be disp@@ ens@@ ed on the Gr@@ under@@ side tax and the property tax will be exposed to funded apartments .
moreover , according to alliances attractive tax @-@ operations are necessary .
the programme for refugee lod@@ ges of the Staats@@ bank K@@ f@@ W comes now well in cities and communities too .
a good week after the start was the assembly evening with 184 million Euros already more than half of the total amount of around 300 million euros .
now , the project could even be sho@@ ved .
refugees have free offshore : Croatia and Slovenia leads Cor@@ ridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , there is practically no circulation , as more refugees choose the way about Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb An@@ no@@ un@@ ces to allow transit through Slovenia to North without hur@@ dles .
but the route is dangerous is however .
Croatia wants to engage with neighbouring Slovenia about setting up a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian interior ministers and when it is necessary we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU @-@ country Croatia has not yet been a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the de@@ preci@@ ation of the Ser@@ bian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees had stopped in Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come over the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik reported the Croatian television channel of R@@ TL .
Hungary had sealed its border to refugees on the day before .
new legislation that occurred the same day in force , make this decent asylum process in Hungary practically superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to make the refugees happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can go through , and we prepare ourselves for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
but people do not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had taken on the morning the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring Croatia .
most of the st@@ unts were reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived both by bus and taxi in the Ser@@ bian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after her arrival she tried to arrive at walking over the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border the refugees have not been around on Gren@@ zz@@ √§@@ une .
for this , the bor@@ ro@@ ve has other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
Min@@ en@@ r√§um@@ er will now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary the border of the border will hardly come to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration office one took up on Tuesday to the newly designed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transit @-@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , almost all - 93 - the main transition in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the applic@@ ants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
at Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ tomorrow there were 40 refugees left there .
practically nobody has a view to be granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after some odd view Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be taken over to this place . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke workers began to rest .
they gathered around the gar@@ bage , that tens of thousands of people left over the streets past weeks .
Sper@@ ling houses were destroyed and one of the entrance to the border town was rebuilt .
for the purpose of this change , nobody wanted to express himself .
Austria will arrive only a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also emphasises its border controls .
around 20,000 immigrants still remained in the country but still in the country .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the return to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in free@@ ass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly on foot .
Mayor wa@@ ited &quot; the border &quot; over the border
&quot; we were busy after the Br@@ √ºck@@ en@@ fest on Sunday with Au@@ fr@@ enz@@ ym@@ es , when suddenly ten people were killed at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says Wern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted by train to Pass@@ au .
because in Germany on Sunday but due to the refugee stream , the railway traffic with Austria had set unexpected , he was immediately providing his help and brought the bases together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
before we got the hop@@ ed guests once again un@@ com@@ promised , with J@@ ause and drinks .
we have said the same , we drive them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ √ñ@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; this is very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
the trains run on Saturday in Wels by a ICE in a regional train towards Pass@@ au in order to prove it after the short notice that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , yet even over the border try .
but the regional one was put down at the Inn of Wern@@ stein am Inn .
in Wern@@ stein is the cross @-@ border generally high in the course .
the Br@@ √ºck@@ en@@ fest linked to the Bav@@ arian neighbours in Sunday , has been a two @-@ brid@@ ge@@ tic rush - organized by the Union Wern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ √°n has now turned further Z@@ ig@@ ors to us , is a logical result of a true holy policy :
rather than in the warehouse of R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke immediately at the establishment of structures to help humanity , our Chancellor continued up to arrogan@@ ce and publicly announced the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ al Circle of National Soci@@ alism .
suffering from this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now facing in the bor@@ der@@ land with cha@@ otic states .
even the p@@ oul@@ try will have to notice that the &quot; gel@@ ob@@ ese country &quot; they invited and welcomed nothing but a further refugee camp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge facing the persistent refugee streams and the approaching winter in order to establish decent conditions for protective seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad from the Search of 35,@@ 000 W@@ inter@@ f@@ ests
Konrad has fully do all hands with the refugee vision .
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to raise sources for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first run center Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already managed to get a grip on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the lodging of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday were without great vor@@ ous , Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master power &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Ministry spoke of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cr@@ atic situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
altogether , Konrad with a need of 8@@ 5,000 qu@@ arti@@ t in the ha@@ unted year .
to meet the numbers , have to be found in the next few weeks to 35.@@ 000 accommodations - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,@@ 000 of the covenant .
should they become more refugees , we can make it happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the heart@@ thro@@ po@@ isons he has already conducted interviews .
they had to be backed to him nor for the coming refugees qu@@ arti@@ t .
&quot; in Upper Austria , it runs well , &quot; Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er said .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Sch√∂n@@ born : that is to be trans@@ figured as the church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; big expectations are the asylum @-@ ordinator also in the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private persons can provide basic accom@@ od@@ ations .
furthermore , it hopes for hotels that are empty during winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ized yesterday the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in emergency times , it could not be that st@@ arti@@ c must have a certain height of the tow@@ el @-@ holder or size of the upper @-@ light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; need of need &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that he was successful in contrast to the Ministry of Internal Affairs , Konrad with his experience .
I am an older gentle@@ man , which one does not end@@ anger the face without further into the face .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the republic , as they declared themselves .
your employees want to raise it on three to four .
the very own sp@@ arti@@ t @-@ search was not yet successful .
Konrad wanted to set a container to the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are clearly problems with the permit .
Linz calls for a better distribution
first , there is no opening an urban complex sports hall and other buildings like Tips Arena and Design Center for keeping refugees planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is no longer necessary , since it could accommodate these persons without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but for emergency purposes , other sites are to be tested on their di@@ gi@@ bility .
critic@@ ising the director upon the division of the refugees within the federal state .
also other areas have to contribute to their contribution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone call with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) has the govern@@ or Josef P@@ √ºhr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday that further action is taking in the refugee request .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer has assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
however , there are now even the corresponding border controls .
there will be no longer any case for special persons with refugees after Germany .
but the exam@@ inations would however have brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ √ºhr@@ inger once more reinforced solidarity in the refugee question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria leads again to its borders again , is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the General @-@ General of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ c industrial line has been officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six store@@ ys of the office and production building , the listed IT Group is S &amp; T moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is intended to be rented to young , innovative companies from technology .
&quot; in IT the clever ch@@ efs are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Lower House .
it could be imagine to invest in start @-@ up firms of the New Year and subsequently also suggest@@ ing what to acc@@ ord .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the start I want to cooperate with the new neighbours - in which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some promises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is only a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the premises , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is looked by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
30 percent of 27@@ 00 square metres of resi@@ dences in the building are rented , for a further 40 percent I will give requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second shop in the arc@@ ades
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are the centre of attention .
actually Jutta wanted to set a dog for Jutta at all .
this project had to release the 49 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old writer of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade @-@ move @-@ up : finally she has now got Zu@@ wachs in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ shop opposite the business , in which they sold as po@@ ckets , suit@@ cases , shoes and ro@@ ds of different manufacturers are now being sold all around D@@ amen@@ bl@@ acks in the brand Fur@@ la , Wall@@ ets are from 75 Euro to have .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously , several weeks have been modified .
&quot; but I have long over@@ laid out whether I should open a shop , &quot; says bro@@ adly .
decisive for the decision was among other things , that also the Fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna at home from the idea of a private s@@ iting location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the ing@@ ed in the big room Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has its own Italian roots .
your fashion @-@ interest has been wide by her mother in the cradle .
I stum@@ bled to the most when something develops and I can show new trends at providing prices .
why so some women have put on the sight of a beautiful pur@@ se in ench@@ ant@@ ment , the professional lady also cannot answer the last security .
perhaps it is because a nice bag was charged every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ lj@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ al@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called followers .
this property also connects also with the milli@@ on@@ aire , the US President wants .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for one @-@ set .
whether he is alien@@ ated , journalist , journalists , or knowledge g@@ aps in the international crisis policy - the applic@@ ant for the US presidential guard won the election campaign strongly .
and it also cuts down .
this is also registered in the pf@@ alz region where the grand@@ parents of the real @-@ milli@@ ard @-@ milli@@ ard date .
the New Yorker at the F@@ √∂hn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a notion of many in the wine @-@ village on the wine @-@ road .
man@@ ger in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ place is related to -@@ zig corners with it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign .
the K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal , em@@ powered man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter has fil@@ med a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous jumping loop , to which along Tr@@ ump also the Ket@@ ch@@ up @-@ Family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump that is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too , so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
to the king of the hearts he did not get it there .
though I give respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also ten@@ ure the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit of a big m@@ aul , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; acci@@ dentally lu@@ te the nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ lj@@ es@@ etter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ ly@@ es@@ etter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ ly@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the makers .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather with@@ ered and opened a e@@ at@@ ery in the United States .
basic stone of the property company were the first land purchases in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of wearing : your desire to return to the home in the long run , the Bav@@ arian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was then belonged .
he did not support Tr@@ ump because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute of Car@@ pf@@ alz History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , at the film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a contrast to the mit@@ ig@@ ating statements of descendants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had repeatedly discussed over Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to prevent illegal immigrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the pol@@ tert , that is not as li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a remote relationship . &quot; the grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was bor@@ row@@ ed Heinz . &quot;
the win@@ egro@@ wer in retirement sees the US rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is always so explosive . &quot;
does he know that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I cannot imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never takes care of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Pensi@@ ons@@ in Veronika Sch@@ r@@ amm as man@@ ger K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the Family Heinz came to a visit something for the church organ , which was generally good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine it from Donald &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she thinks it better if he did not win the choice , for &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the s@@ cars at the time of his grandfather , would have been as he had , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would he never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah B√ºh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grapes are mature without the President of Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , was inter@@ viewed for the Tr@@ ump for a long time , have seen 12 000 che@@ ers , even in the US the interest .

seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take the loss of the leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson shares after Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but it did not have great shifting to the reviews for today .

the Riv@@ ale Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Samantha Ar@@ my@@ tage , hidden in London as part of a week @-@ week series of international television shows , which also belonged to Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this limitation of the resistance was not part of Australian TV @-@ viewers to play no role because Sun@@ rise has posted an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spect@@ ators in the five main towns , compared to the 33@@ 9.000 ‚Ç¨ .
today , a slight increase compared to the rating for Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number stayed behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed in recent months .
in August Today was average of 3@@ 18,@@ 000 compared with the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the distance was between 4@@ 0,000 and 5@@ 0,000 .
until now , Sun@@ rise stands on an average of 34@@ 9,@@ 000 spect@@ ators to 3@@ 14,@@ 000 for today .
this is the most interesting thing happens every morning .
the winds of change concerns these hours more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Nur@@ enst@@ ar of Justice to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama for a recently twi@@ sted father , which ex@@ cludes along with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spect@@ ators .
critics were asked if Thom@@ son met a hit @-@ show Solo without the rafting star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Fac@@ tor of Seven remained strongly with 1,@@ 136 million spect@@ ators , and hit the one block ( 83@@ 8,@@ 000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26,@@ 000 ) .
Seven had mixed results on the evening two from The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17@@ h30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe sur@@ rendered the average 44@@ 6,000 spect@@ ators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 - 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped into 6@@ 23,@@ 000 spect@@ ators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gui@@ res Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13,@@ 000 ) .
on Monday evening the first half hour was generated by The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spect@@ ators and in the second half an hour of 7@@ 20,000 .
Hot @-@ Seat at an average of 6@@ 20,000 .
the decrease in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be optim@@ istic that hot @-@ seat is ultimately en@@ forced at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar , that it didn &apos;t manage to over@@ wings the Mc@@ Gui@@ ana Show .

the final three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret unveil@@ ed ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly manifest who The Bachelor wins .
the woman , in which Sam Wood was finally sk@@ int@@ ed in The bach@@ el@@ or , was har@@ med in the largest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not disclose whether they are the one that has received the last rose .
but when we went to Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you may possibly be given a notice to who will be the vic@@ tori@@ ous .
Sam Wood continues to be sealed his lips until the final on Thursday .
all three women have left themselves in a ly@@ rian way of why wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive outlook as reasons for why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get the last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they could become their answers to the player who gained the heart of the Bachelor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki s@@ led both fast - except for himself - Mack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment when I went to the house and ( Sar@@ ah ) and Adam energies , I noticed that they were quite compatible and I thought that in the whole course of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing with both feet on the Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; she added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from their point of view , Mack@@ ay says that the Haus@@ er last week made it clear that Wood could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m already subject to him , &quot; he said .
and when she was asked to choose to choose wood if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling her .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining naked girl equally - it is a op@@ ted between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on Ten .

J@@ arr@@ yd Hay@@ ne had several options to start his NF@@ L career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the US - and there were many other teams that sent out questions after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
some trainers would have disp@@ elled Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank as he lost a straight @-@ angle as it did the Aussie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League converter to his first P@@ unt return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Min@@ nes@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next chance to a unt return and also in the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continue his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of urged his ro@@ ok@@ ies to the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula increased Hay@@ ne also in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ re@@ porter &apos;s In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was encouraged by special teams coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who was advised to forget his temp@@ ted wr@@ ack and to take care of the next game .
J@@ arr@@ yd Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t was restored in a p@@ unt which was restored in the first quarter of the Min@@ nes@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian Ge@@ fold for his NF@@ L de@@ buted .
Hay@@ ne for@@ s@@ ook the playground and then told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a bad start to his NF@@ L career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne combines the car@@ vers with his Orig@@ in debut at that time in 2007 , when a pass was conducted in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area at a Tr@@ y for Queensland .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the Free voters are demanding due to the high refugee figures the attitude of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
party and leader of Hubert Ai@@ w@@ anger warned at the beginning of the DM @-@ autumn h@@ ur in Gro√ü@@ wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis at Bay@@ erns schools if there are a minimum 1000 additional teachers in order to keep the schools before col@@ lagen , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
&quot; otherwise we will get ent@@ our@@ ings in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the outdoor fr@@ actions of the Free voters t@@ ends until Friday in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consec@@ ration &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually , other major topics were intended .
but the record number of refugees also domin@@ ates the Free elec@@ tors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the topic asylum is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sur@@ g@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ v@@ anger called for the establishment of UN @-@ Guardian zones for refugees in Syria , just as there were war on the n@@ ine@@ ties in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not on that , we must remember the causes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Free elec@@ tor@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum seek@@ ers want to push the free voters as fast as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Ai@@ v@@ anger also demanded more staff for the administration , which are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need a minimum of 50 new asylum seeker , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the DM @-@ leader critic@@ ized that several federal states cannot be consistent : &quot; we bro@@ w nation@@ wide consistent standards of the federal states . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to be able to act more capable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the local policy in Gro√ü@@ hei@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
a long long term bur@@ ner remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , K@@ ult@@ us@@ minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) launched the pilot &apos;s attempt &quot; mid @-@ level plus &quot; starting at the start of an extension of the ob@@ ased economy of three to four years - as a result , it takes only nine years up to secondary school .

4 people killed , after police officers on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal are shooting
four people , including a 4 @-@ year boy , were killed in the South Nepal after the police rubber bel@@ gi@@ ants in a crowd of crowd , which demonstrate against the proposed new Constitution , said a be@@ aten on Wednesday .

Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police have used Tr@@ √§n@@ eng@@ as and then shot up into the air before returning to rubber bul@@ b .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were inju@@ red , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets , of which it is known that they may kill , however , traditionally used as less deadly alternative , obviously a high death rate is produced .
the argument was the last in weeks of non@@ violent protest in Nep@@ als southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adh@@ esi say that new provinces to be formed in the framework of the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence .
there were protests in the Western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ an who wish to have their own state .

Google starts re@@ charge donations to raise 11 million US $ for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL ) announced a dou@@ bling donations to raise the thousands of refugees trying to help the thousands of refugees trying to over@@ head the thousands of refugees , since they fle@@ e from war to poor and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the don@@ ate call on his blog .
rather than letting a manager make notice , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google assistant who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to our journey were many dark railway and bus trips , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are des@@ perate after help .
the donations will go to four non @-@ profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally earned don@@ ate to a value of 5.5 million on google.com .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four@@ teen @-@ year war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year .

for slightly overweight di@@ ab@@ etics can be weight @-@ los@@ sy surgery .
the advantages of weight loss treatment for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily over@@ looked people with diabetes after the weight loss treatment longer live than those who received non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data require a long time to demonstrate something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss Surgery , who wrote a guid@@ eline about the new study in J@@ ama .
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the master .
it reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absor@@ b food .
over the years , obesity in the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes are proved efficient , but most studies were carried out in people who are sick with a Body Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain level of weight in size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng &apos;s Hospital counts , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two kinds of obesity and stomach mol@@ ding - for medical treatments for type @-@ 2 diabetes in people who were easily ob@@ ese .
the average BM@@ I below , which subj@@ ected to this surgery , s@@ ank from 31 to 24,@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BM@@ I in those who did not @-@ surgical diabetes treatment received approximately equivalent to 29 .
among those who subj@@ ected to surgical procedure , are totally ext@@ ingu@@ ished at 36 % of the diabetes condition completely and with 28 % partly .
in the medic@@ ally @-@ treated group , the body as compared to this type of diabetes are only at one percent and partially at only approximately two percent .
in addition , the results were in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; in general better in the &quot; surgical &apos; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also checked the patient @-@ blood levels of hem@@ mo@@ vi@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood @-@ sugar values throughout the period .
Win@@ it@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researcher .
after the surgery the average hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level of around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as it reflects in the improved hem@@ ost@@ al level - has decreased not the mort@@ ality in five years , thus the leit@@ ner researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also provide average results in two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the B@@ yp@@ ass surgery had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater trac@@ tors in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and H√§@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.@@ 1 % vs. 2.@@ 1 % ) and signed a complete conversion of diabetes ( 46,@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavy people in Sweden that led them to a longer life , says Black@@ stone of the University of Arizona , college of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was popular among ob@@ ese people who subj@@ ected itself to an obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried in conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , said Black@@ stone , it is so@@ othing to people with a BM@@ I below 35 which are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney illness , she said .
Black@@ stone imp@@ lied that people and their doctors have to start to take weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting for a long time until we get people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they accum@@ ulate these genetic changes , that their bodies with obesity and diabetes are firm , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;

&quot; it &apos;s impossible to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take up all refugees , the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lie . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddh@@ ist leader urged to end violence in the refugees of refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of continuous refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford where ethics studies .
he urged that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mi@@ red , but the situation is not reasonable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama &apos;s Dalai Lama was praised in addressing the crisis , he empha@@ sized that there is only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousands of refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we must think about how the k@@ ill@@ ings is reduced in their countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reduce the use of force . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented by George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and turned out that the US violent response from the US moved to a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events .
after September 11 I have expressed my sympath@@ ies in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and this has failed consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of shipping inf@@ ect@@ ant by children in the last 4 years
Gi@@ ft@@ sper@@ ms in the US report on nearly 400 @-@ percentage increase in the number of children under 12 years , who swal@@ low a fuel inf@@ ect@@ ant , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , con@@ vic@@ tories the cases of revenues of hands @-@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , the tox@@ ft@@ ment service centers will report from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly more frequent to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go to the staff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ant drink , while some do it to impress your friends or because of a MU@@ T@@ PRO@@ BE in social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can only drink because of a cheap experience .
young people have the inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ant with alcoholic mouth@@ wash mixed to get a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be released from attractive frag@@ ran@@ ces of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ er@@ ated .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with earthquake , grapes and orange @-@ du@@ ft , which are very attractive for children .
wall san@@ iti@@ zer do not contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in small children can already lead a few sy@@ ring@@ es for alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation .
&quot; it is most concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ ison Centre in the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not let loose whis@@ ky let around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and if children come about it , then it &apos;s a fast way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four guns of stra@@ wberry smell of a pot in school was taken into a emergency treatment .
her blood @-@ alcoholic de@@ centr@@ ation was 179 , twice higher than the thres@@ hold that counts in an adult law as dr@@ unk , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey said to be a staff doctor who treated it at the Con@@ winn@@ able Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah ad@@ ored its words , and was not able to go when she came up in the emergency .
doctors more gu@@ arded overnight in a separate children &apos;s house for signs of mil@@ let trau@@ ma , as the girl liked by the alcohol and had b@@ aked up his head , she said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; this was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah@@ s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers advised to use non @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant and inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ant outside the reach of the child .
about alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were linked with deaths .
in 2013 two women died in Ontario women according to the lo@@ wering of hand@@ ler @-@ infectious , which contained a toxic , non @-@ clear@@ ance ingredient .
staff of health authorities assume that the product meth@@ anol has a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ anol alcohol which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York , their &quot; appropri@@ ated &quot; teacher , &quot; issued anti @-@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , then it is a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to wall @-@ inf@@ ect@@ ant and ex@@ iles them from their room .
the police concerned the failed plan as &quot; squ@@ ig@@ t@@ ism &quot; and a discipl@@ ined measures to the school authorities .

de Bo@@ er , currently a Ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland she will show no climax@@ es of Cel@@ tic Games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here do not just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
you are talking about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m Games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games .

now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly so - but we must go on .
we really need the support of Cel@@ tic because the player is better off .
now together is so important .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the Perman@@ ent Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ y commented the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year that Scotland has made the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
during these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I will be a witness of an expression in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man will be put to death .
when it happens and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in an audience @-@ gallery in the death chamber at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p will be replaced by the tox@@ ins .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was for the first time in January about his best friend , and even though I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day came closer , I started to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists should be able to see Hind@@ u in the US , and there are often more applic@@ ants than places available , there is a f@@ ab@@ normal lot@@ tery instead of deciding who will be elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media outlets from 12 to five .
who is selected , who will observe it emoti@@ onally .
I cannot do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with tel@@ eph@@ ony and a two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we often lau@@ gh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and take a pin to take up what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma sur@@ rendered to Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of prisoners , how he wants it , and you get access .
I accept myself with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she ad@@ mits that she could have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better reform@@ ulate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it is wrong , what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants that an international re@@ porter is present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ viewer of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I did .
here I will not go into detail here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty to be a benefici@@ ary .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of the mor@@ se .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porter to whom you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it is said to see a man an unnecessary death .
man after hum@@ id police @-@ hunting and came out of the cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry , when he over@@ sp@@ ake the man from the Cann@@ ing River .
a man of Perth , the police dism@@ issed himself was un@@ successful , when he was lying in the sil@@ ken and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters from a police be@@ amed , the tried to move it gently to go to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was taken on Tuesday to a house @-@ peaceful incident in Beck@@ enh@@ am .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , this to escape to them in the direction of Cann@@ ing River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I come not out , come and get yourself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Sal@@ lan Per@@ hav@@ ec was not too excited about making his Uni@@ form wet , so he turned to a safe t@@ actic to be - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards are trying to ex@@ pose him to complete him and threat@@ ens the racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria are attemp@@ ting to re@@ install a sp@@ y in its st@@ ables last year and thre@@ aten the race immediately .
he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integer section of racing Victoria and claimed that they took a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a racing day treatment , the last stra@@ w of stra@@ w on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tries to do what is best for the racing sport and he himself worked in difficult circumstances than it was about the positive Kob@@ alt T@@ up@@ fer@@ mentation at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he can not explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had ref@@ illed for 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and didn &apos;t want it to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sight as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to tall grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have long been eating , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that all come out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
you know that it continues .
sometimes you have re@@ acted , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to go to the prot@@ ru@@ by and I want my poss@@ essor to think I try my best for them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when they begin thinking , I do not do that , then I should no longer be co@@ aches .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy got the bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , so that the integer Department had tried to cl@@ ing its stable .
&quot; before eigh@@ teen months were Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart in a room with a man - whom I will be asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do inside my st@@ alls , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com
they obviously believe that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , they certainly should believe in their n@@ oses , because they attempt to grasp , failed .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , ehem . Chairman of Route L , David Moo@@ die , acting president of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the RV@@ L , were aware of the time and still are today .
should I bring that to the view that it is personally being ?
does the RV@@ L behave and perhaps makes people responsible outside of trainers with what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and stum@@ bled to me , and I have no doubt that what I say to it now .
but I now have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ stration levels of the trainer have built itself with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to him that he could throw himself his license on the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ question@@ ed Master Caviar , be@@ amed the racing tags @-@ treatment game , ridicul@@ ously , after a pack mud or sound on the horse debate was applied , what was viol@@ ated against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has irrit@@ ated sil@@ ently to the leg .
it could have been as yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
it had also become so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an examination of this affair has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; all of us see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy is fighting for ri@@ vals because of asser@@ tions on Ring@@ battle
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described criticism of the Tac@@ na of his player as &quot; agenda Set@@ ting &quot; from two Premier League to the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee will be the &quot; Storm &quot; with its team during the high Storm victory in qualifying &apos;s qualifying session in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a little disgu@@ ised note about the Storm Team , having obtained the game winning the final victory against North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample set &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League , and said that the two of Queensland is not too good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that she will concentrate only on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy sur@@ faced that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team imp@@ lied him with confidence , as it concerns they were worried about the Storm team to be be@@ aten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that emerg@@ es again and again - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson talk about ring battles as they opened to us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that in the whole year we have changed nothing at our faul@@ ty system or techniques , but in the last six weeks we tac@@ kles our contact with Tac@@ kles .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to exercise . he is therefore probably not getting acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to losing , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is already strange , as this emerg@@ es at the time of the year time and again .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett idea from &quot; exciting football &quot; and has remembered his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra has won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne talks about exciting football .
he &apos;s his play on Saturday evening with our on Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of that .
but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game , which you would like to play if you have this kind of player .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants him to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt for making them playing like this .
I need stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they did not think of us when it was about big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm for Roo@@ ster had a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boy .
the game of the Bron@@ x was probably a good game , I have not seen it but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is that exciting game ?
or are they going to do and do not have a points of stretching ?
for me they are the sched@@ ules .
if they mention it , it means that we will meet on her in a phase .
the Storm team is free to receive this weekend because it won the right to receive North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening in the final quarter at the A@@ AMI Park . the ticket office will start tomorrow next morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ Deposit to Dru@@ an@@ kl@@ age
a man who may have a life @-@ long punishment threat@@ ens because of his experiment , into the possession of 40 k@@ ilo@@ grams of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were mut@@ ed to Queensland , was released against a deposit of 200,000 tons .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested the last month after the federal police took 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endant at the marina in the course of the morning and later at Caf√© Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ adh@@ ouse where the police found 40 k@@ ilo@@ grams of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly life @-@ saving punishment for an attempt to possess a commercial lot co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the attorney of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that no evidence he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the Caf√© could have been an inno@@ cu@@ ous cause .
the judge on the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the threat of mac@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday .
in the pris@@ oner , he bel@@ lied the police about his place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs mother and brother @-@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in common to achieve his release .
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ ed statements of the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Richter f@@ ag@@ an .
but this alone will not suff@@ ice to keep it off , and not to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released to deposit but under the conditions that he announces his Australian and Ser@@ b Pass , stopping at the police daily and stopping at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

cars from the compact class are currently especially asked : about 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations dropped according to power station ( KBA ) only in August this segment .

between all the fut@@ urist@@ ic conceptual and new wa@@ ist and luxury cars this year will be featured a lot of new compact models .
one of the biggest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German auto industry is the Opel A@@ stra who will be at the dealers in the autumn .
&quot; A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel boss Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the heart of the brand .
thus , the volume model is also well sold , the new A@@ stra is not much more expensive for this .
Opel marks entry below the largest compet@@ itor VW Golf in Aussicht , which starts at 17 650 Euro .

as a second variant will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which is also already visible on the I@@ AA .
and what will be up to new Comp@@ actor next to A@@ stra in the I@@ AA ?
Renault M√©@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his A@@ stra @-@ competitors M√©@@ gan@@ e into the race .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court has given a ex @-@ H@@ √§f@@ t@@ ling of the Just@@ iz@@ z@@ enti@@ ometer Te@@ gel , who was sum@@ mon@@ ed monthly to a small cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the injury of her human dignity , l@@ ain@@ ees are generally entitled to financial compensation when they are placed in small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was decided by the Bundes@@ ver@@ fassungs@@ gericht in one of Wednesday published on Wednesday .
suffer@@ ers may even therefore hope for money , even if they were locked only a few days in the narrow rooms ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
in this way an ex @-@ H@@ √§f@@ t@@ ling was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in the judicial anstalt Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with some five square meters of ground floor ; the toilet was spatial not separate .
after that , the man , who moved according to his lawyer by now on the free foot in a larger cell .
his am@@ t@@ ying dis@@ days due to un@@ worthy adhesi@@ on conditions against the land Berlin failed .
but the constitutional rec@@ ti@@ fication took away the jud@@ gement of the Court of Berlin and returns the case for the renewed exam .
they see human dignity inju@@ red .
Kammer@@ gericht now decide on the amount of compensation
even if for the legal reasons of the frag@@ ile period only a few days dis@@ days for compensation are decisive , be given an arbitr@@ ary name , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a conden@@ sing of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kammer@@ court must now clarify the height of the dent@@ ary damage .
the Constitu@@ tional Court in the past have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of prisoners .
in April they spoke to an in@@ mate dem@@ nity first in April , because he was suspended in a cell in a cell .
human @-@ worthy is according to a decision by 2011 also the multip@@ lier of a cell without separate toilet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitu@@ tional Court , which at a p@@ au@@ ght in a parallel case held in a parallel drop in November 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dam@@ aging expression was over three months from a daily basis between 15 to 21 hours in a like @-@ like cell , such as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons were also step@@ ped in recent weeks due to lack of staff in the Head@@ lines .
prisoners are therefore always enclosed 23 hours , the aggressi@@ vity rise , even to bat , it should have been due to the ten@@ se situation .
according to information from the Just@@ iz@@ ress@@ an@@ elle are 21 places in Te@@ gel because of after@@ thought angels not occupied , 19 should 2016 fall away .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers , according to forecasts up by the Federal Ministry of Germany are coming to Germany , according to statement of Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrates precisely in face of the unusual challenge to resolve : &quot; I will be back and again : we can do that , and we will do that . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
after different forecasts between 35@@ 0000 ( approxim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the Pest@@ el @-@ Institute ) , each year - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
dramatically , the lack of housing , but particularly at paid rental apartments : from 600@@ 00 bis 800@@ 00 Social apartments from the rental out of rent out , and in order to apply this particularly favourable housing for refugees too .
Bundes@@ minist@@ minist@@ erin Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants therefore to double the promotion , of currently 518 million to one billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the Pest@@ el Institute &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 80 000 volunte@@ ered per year , and for this , the federal government would have to invest an increase in height of 6.4 billion per year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists and Bundes@@ minist@@ eriums agree that there will also be more tax benefits for investment in housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after estimates by the Institute for labour @-@ market and occupational research , it is estimated that 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be incur@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , refugees in Germany did not systematically asked about their qualifications to help them start , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees but it is crucial if they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the esteem in the assembly group , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the emig@@ rants , says Mig@@ r@@ ation@@ alist Diet@@ rich th@@ rash .
according to Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt , it has given a political shift : from labour ban for refugees to recognition of labor .
while there was an employment ban for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ dual capacity , asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society - also because of the lack of skilled workers - a majority of view en@@ vi@@ ous the view that refugees should be enabled more quickly in access to the labour market .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is missing English .
up to now there is still no end @-@ to @-@ date offer of general and CP@@ D language courses .
studies also show that jobs most often through personal contacts are taught .
the structure of networks is therefore integrating a view from the hei@@ hardt of the king s@@ way into the labour integration process .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugees parents spend their children in the Kit@@ ties , estimated 10 to 15 percent , &quot; for the hi@@ ther@@ to parents , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ chem@@ in , speaker for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration of wr@@ acking is distributed in different languages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the need for educ@@ ators move strongly through the great number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training of training , e.g. by adding more specialized schools . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the countries , students are prepared without a German knowledge in will welcome the lessons .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , teachers , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ays of the Berlin School administration .
the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no Bundes@@ land asylum seek@@ ers or remin@@ ding the study - the only exception was Berlin , In@@ sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his attitude .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studying refugees could be facilit@@ ated with access to the higher education institution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for refugees with a re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement or ran@@ gement do not get services after the asylum seeker , if they begin a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they basically do not get a BA@@ F√∂@@ G &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they do not fall under the circle of b@@ old people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
patient &apos;s refugees had to be lived in Germany so far for four years to be eligible for BA@@ F√∂@@ G author@@ izes from 1 January 2016 onwards , this margin is over@@ thrown at 15 months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but these funding gap must be closed but call to Steffen Kra@@ urch , Ber@@ lins Perman@@ ent Secretary for Science , and the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the students should immediately get BA@@ F√∂@@ G .
in future Islam will play an important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should follow Islam succ@@ essi@@ vely the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state churches have a right to develop into a new state of religion .
important would be the foundation of an Islamic welfare of the state that takes care of the re@@ com@@ ers .
among the rights are obligations also obligations .
in this way , the representative of Islam must be able to agree on a clear contact person with the state , and to cooperate with the state in many areas and set him certain controls .
this is also the willingness to take he@@ ed against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts may also be entered into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to resolve such conflicts in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have immediately their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
in future , integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society today .
consequently , the majority of society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is also more urgent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since a scar@@ ce decade , a anti @-@ discrimination work and a general gender equality law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is slow to learn how the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ series showed to be systematically ignored in police and authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and stakeholders about ni@@ ch@@ tw@@ ei@@ er German already call for long and why international agreements are to be realised in the next few years if the country must remain peaceful and benefit its new citizens - for the benefit of all .
generally speaking , Germany was able to feed the previously anticipated refugees of medic@@ ally , means in@@ tap@@ est@@ ed by Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Man@@ - Power and capacities are concerned , we create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , this must be added from money into the system .
to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , to ex@@ pose all assump@@ tions equal to the registration of health cards .
produced achievements could be dism@@ ant@@ led later with the Bundes@@ l√§nder .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able , to drop so many people with the restricted service catalogue that I see asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise , the doctors take the doctors in particular to create their language barriers .
so far , the Berlin University of Sciences has proven the@@ a Bor@@ de , immigrants become worse about their disease than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in doctors have to be rep@@ uted by interpre@@ ting them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be helped by many refugees but also with more common medical meetings in emergency out@@ breaks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with a different diagnostic view .
under refugee camp , there are currently much more un@@ contamin@@ ated disabilities , and among the young people it is about HIV learning .
with the partial other disease @-@ pictures of German doctors made by their training but clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ it@@ ism or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as difficult to recognize , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what concerns the anno@@ is perhaps even alle@@ vi@@ ation in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans have had a highly developed education system , possible refugees or even doctors .
to be practi@@ cing , however , they would have to demonstrate their qualifications and possibly can decrease again .
at least half of the refugees quot@@ ed in Germany is sil@@ ly sick . ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) is psychological : most people suffer from a post @-@ sad pills or depression .
he was particularly vulnerable , says Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study published by the Technical University of Munich is that every five @-@ fifth refugee is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
anyone who is suffering from a post@@ trau@@ mat@@ ous load @-@ bot@@ toms , is suffering from among other things with the so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respir@@ atory , sw@@ win@@ del , coron@@ ary and death .
further symptoms are ins@@ - and concentr@@ ations , strong terr@@ ors and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms would be chronic , be an early treatment necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
so far , only four percent of psych@@ ologically sick refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy .
while , psych@@ isch @-@ ill @-@ seek@@ ers can challenge a motion for psych@@ otherapy , but the treatment usually takes several months .
moreover , in the social h@@ emisph@@ eres , most of the state workers or doctors , who are not trained for the psychological diseases are not trained , whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this is often led to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .

Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ it Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong talk in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Afri@@ que leader , fell down the stairs in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly on the social media .
the opening of the parliament was also com@@ for@@ ting due to alleg@@ ations of members of the opposition that they had given anonymous deaths and they had been warned of the speech by Mr Mu@@ gabe with book .
last month they had booked him tu@@ fted and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the nation in parliament - this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday .
the Spe@@ aker of the Movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven leaders have received SMS messages on their mobile phones that they warned that Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es address b@@ other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gab@@ es State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they war@@ ns the affected parliamentary group that ends the imm@@ unity in the parliament and once they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chief Apostle said that of Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the threats to politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build up to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will later divide companies into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service providers .
the expected job @-@ building results in a load of more than 2,7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will allow more competitive , more sustainable cost @-@ structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ woman and Chief Executive , who will guide the unity following the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger focus than it is HP today and we have a wide and deep@@ est portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as a independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing un@@ att@@ ained technology solutions to companies so far , &quot; says an explanation of the company .
it was granted a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electr@@ o Alto and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring progress to get the removal of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the most recent in this area , based on conviction that strongly focused companies perform better performance .
FC ar@@ sen@@ al captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ m@@ ates before the game against the Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind which the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere must stand
Wen@@ ger said towards Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation runs for a plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly be missed at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer will certainly be un@@ certain .
the great shame to this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished last season following a separate buttons lab@@ elled strongly and then again found its old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not threat the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone , that is not good healing .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in conjunction with his k@@ nu@@ ances or with the injury he had previously had .
this may be true out of purely medical point , but like less recognized , there is the related danger of further inju@@ ries@@ . still , when a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops a uncomfortable pattern .
the investigation of Premier In@@ ju@@ ries Ltd has been present in 23 different illnesses from Wil@@ sh@@ ere for his debut in six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of ar@@ sen@@ als 157 Lig@@ ue in the last five seasons .
the wider picture of ar@@ sen@@ al is that they were in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League Clubs , who have held most of the vulner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last throughout the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a random period , a time when you strengthen your body and gain combat power , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ sen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ t@@ enh@@ am Hot@@ sp@@ ur in the coming Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger will present a rotation inside the team .
H√©@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ √≠n and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta start to start .
Wen@@ ger can also catch the Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need it to be a small break @-@ up , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
although ar@@ sen@@ al is clear favor@@ ites , by group F further , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Sta@@ dion in Zagreb is one of the players with the largest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; un@@ defeated &quot; campaign launched in the last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aded on Tuesday night through an earthquake , but on the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that ar@@ sen@@ al has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League surrender to Monaco and will be driven by far @-@ reaching hope , with its management the association lead to its first European au@@ sp@@ al tri@@ umph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked for ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Com@@ edy @-@ Show , who gave us serious li@@ abilities on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is evident , especially with regard to how the need for males to open up , now still dist@@ ressed as ever before , such as su@@ icide rates under young men at a 15 @-@ year test@@ icles .
in 2013 it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and three times more pre@@ valent in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Labour Mis@@ er@@ ol ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a her@@ ed@@ itary life ) in 2015 as the year of the man to ask the culture to ask the culture to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to face this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ School students with anti @-@ depress@@ ants symptoms decided that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery .
for those who are non @-@ depress@@ ants , hal@@ ved a circle of spiritual healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends too , so that a friendship can work so far .
in the age of social media , communication with its emphasis on style about substance is the inv@@ ali@@ ability of the answer is often more important than a significant contact .
our digital life have the need to appear strong , lively and successful , even if in reality domin@@ ates isolation .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists are extr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health a lot more profound .
and like a video game invent@@ or and milli@@ on@@ aire recently , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was put on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but defined by his personality , which gli@@ stering through the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in the foot@@ steps and a longing for Ross - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to each case , even if they often with@@ hold their feelings to explore .
like a staff of phone calls it told me : ... &quot; my list@@ eners for people who feel de@@ pressed and are su@@ icide , has really clearly demonstrated to me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I com@@ promised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me in mind when I try to offer long @-@ term change mechanism .
it presents very clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
as much as my object @-@ out@@ sider on the phone the people in ey@@ eb@@ rows the despair also likes , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you attend this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest going to the celebration of the day completely new designed backdrop , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you want to watch in Star@@ bu@@ cks somebody alone , give him a smile and say hello again .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends is sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PSG - Malm@@ √∂ .
angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ √∂ .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps to move in Malm@@ √∂ .
here are the Game Report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held Course , as Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season with a extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ √∂ in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadi@@ on on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after starting his Champions League Deb@@ √º@@ ts as a PSG player who brought the French master to the path , but afterwards it missed a number of occasions even before they finally generated their lead , as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute a sco@@ op sco@@ op .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A needs Paris a strong start against the Swedish champion because they seek not only the qualification for K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps but an improvement in the way to the quarter @-@ finals in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class@@ room of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovi@@ cs adap@@ tive chances in front of the gate . he later began in play against his hom@@ etown team and against the club where he began his illustr@@ ating career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or to win back in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ected in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won yet , although I regret that we did not have sco@@ red one or two other doors . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned to the Paris team about his injury to the Paris team that was able to last a 2 : 2 oun@@ ces on their own position against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was engra@@ ved in the fourth minute through Di Maria .
the Argentin@@ ean wings was referred to as the man who took over the next stage in Europe , when he took over in the last month of Manchester United , and he clar@@ i@@ fies , why , when he completed in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass in the Malm@@ √∂ defence before he closed to Johan Wil@@ ds in the long corner of the network .
but if anyone believed that PSG won a great victory that was disappointed .
Malm@@ √∂ , the Cel@@ tic made in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was ranked with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a serious compet@@ itor .
but apart from a shot of Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who went far to Kevin Tr@@ ento P@@ fo@@ sten at the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead he gave himself sometimes on , with some fail@@ ures and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who was arrested in no less than five attempts alone in the first half , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after rest@@ art .
nevertheless he pointed out much more than he got his fellow players in the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who turned the Di Maria into a shooting , which was lo@@ wer@@ ed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ...
the second gate fell short after the hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the s@@ ay@@ er obtained his sixth Sa@@ is@@ ont@@ or after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic had found a left side flan@@ k by Max@@ well .
this ended up all mind that Malm@@ √∂ could come back into the game , and only an excellent entrance of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , before replacement carrier Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was detected a gate at the end .
the Trainer of Malm@@ √∂ , Age Har@@ eide , was later to say that PSG won a class about his team and the Norwegian said , &quot; Our last Champions League game was last year .
since then , we played only in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hut from before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creating .
Matt Dam@@ on made the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said she won &apos;t need behind the scenes .
during a episode of Sunday night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light sub@@ trac@@ ed the experienced actor Brown , when this stressed the need for alternative perspectives indicated in relation to a black prot@@ agonist in the chosen scrip@@ tw@@ ist .
&quot; if we talk about diversity then you do it during the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show . &quot; in@@ sured Dam@@ on .
Brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with bel@@ ei@@ dig@@ it un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian .
Dam@@ on and Brown closed the producer Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the Show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to call people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a Nut@@ te that is be@@ aten by her white breeding .
the producer of De@@ ar White People continued for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio , for the director &apos;s rights to the film : Dam@@ on re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ance to give us something we could not want . &quot;
after the discussion aired , explo@@ ded the social media from dis@@ approval via Dam@@ ons comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni res@@ umes his anger about the clip by talking about &quot; Matt Dam@@ on on the only black person in space , so he can explain its diversity - that is SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the Twe@@ aker served more than 5,000 sa@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ ons Com@@ ments come to a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion .
after the Teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the movement Black Li@@ ves sail@@ ter nation@@ wide effect and urged law@@ makers and authorities to discrimin@@ ate against the colour .
in February , the Singer Prince made a reference to the movement while introducing the nomin@@ ate albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums silent Mat@@ ter &quot; ( albums are still their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , they still have their significance .
in some recent times , leaders of the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter released a statement in response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality of Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered to be a tro@@ p group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media fashion , that was invited to visit the Pope to discuss about the portra@@ yal of the Catholic Church in the West .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; American Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or &apos;s First Champion
professional clim@@ bers and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or on Monday night and took the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ with home .
the contest show which currently completed their 7th season has never experienced a contest , who could close all the steps of his obstacle course .
during the season , there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , up to the Fin@@ als .
the last task also belonged to the climbing site at a 75 feet long climbing day in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten ended the task within the time , what he finished the first ath@@ l@@ ete who completed the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster than made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the harsh economic victory , still under shock about winning the Grand price of 1 million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never had more than 10,000 $ or had life &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. as I cannot even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the intro@@ duc@@ tory producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood re@@ porter to discuss the finals and why B@@ ritten , even though he ended up at the par@@ cours , not any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , he gets the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t believe he was swe@@ eps about it .
he is so fortunate to have done what he has done .
masses of awards received him from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be be@@ aten by someone then I am glad there was Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac had just as felt when she had re@@ ign@@ ed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or was extended for an au@@ chte season , the fil@@ ming will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers gr@@ ind of Min@@ nes@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OLI@@ S@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Spo@@ iler , but also played this part on Tuesday perfectly against Min@@ nes@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field .
the T@@ wins have a chance to climb within a playing hand of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League of Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word which was so difficult to synth@@ esi@@ ze over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all vic@@ tories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Pri@@ mus .
Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support , acting as Detroit three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times in 1 / 3 inner and allowed three of us .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strong , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw in the bull@@ cat@@ cher each game and I will definitely go down in the game .
the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied tiger @-@ j@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since the middle of August .
it was the first tri@@ er hit @-@ game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ran the pl@@ y@@ wood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( weight training ) , saw distinc@@ tly better off in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly to the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear , at the end of the seventh inner , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back to the game again .
the B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left line .
right Fields of Aaron H@@ icks reached a B@@ unt , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy depart@@ ed wall , the only man with whom he was faced , in front of the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ stroke Miguel S@@ ano , who de@@ duc@@ ted a two @-@ run tra@@ der .
with a pair of run@@ ners and the finish @-@ run with the second brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was this in the Major League leading 27th times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a Double Play
after Detroit added at the end of the ninth inside of an Insurance @-@ run , the wall , a R@@ BI @-@ Double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and obtained the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed state , however , S@@ ano has three pitches for its fifth place finish .
Detroit benef@@ itted to the pre@@ l@@ ude of the game by an even more movable Phil Hu@@ ghes .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two Inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been rep@@ lied before the play of the danger list after having been missing for a back suffering more than a month .
&quot; obviously not the beginning , which I would have desired , &quot; said Hu@@ ghes , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I thought , and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches in the third inning . &quot;
after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ um gave a single to Second @-@ Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
one Two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 track series with the run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third basket Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single at the right , managed another run but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third which the threat ended .
the Tig@@ ers laid on the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out Single of Center @-@ Fields of Anthony G@@ ose on the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ ental .
he did not work very well , but he got the right place .
Hu@@ ghes found himself in a pitch @-@ Count , had no points in the third inning , before he replaced with the Rel@@ ie@@ ver &apos;s A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter replaced .
when Hu@@ ghes made it up to three of us at six hits and a walk with four stro@@ ke@@ outs .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the deci@@ de@@ dly reflect on military action options cannot be held without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in Germany , Austria again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on the Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station . yes , after Hungary no one will be returned .
Germany also sent no refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the question of an agreement , after which Germany could start a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l &apos;s Leit@@ ner said this conversation between the general director of public security and representatives from Germany .
concrete figures did not call it and dism@@ issed talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees had come from Hungary to Austria .
your goal is mostly Germany .
ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her then Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU governments have not so far been able to agree on a joint approach in the crisis .
the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting on the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees .
given the strong refugee property in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries of the first @-@ time and distribution of people .
the federal government , together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late afternoon after nearly four @-@ duty consultations with the Prime Minister at the office office in Berlin .
Merkel must under@@ score those people , the protection , be@@ ka@@ men this too .
but who has no perspective on who can not stay in Germany too .
this conception was split into the round op@@ pres@@ sive .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed , the state as a whole now gives a &quot; huge power of force . &quot;
thousands of bi@@ ased refugees now stuck on the Bal@@ ancer@@ route .
at night , Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on the night .

this neighbouring country is unlike Serbia to the EU .
Hungary would like to prevent spreading contrac@@ tor over Romania , Ungar@@ ns Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new Gren@@ zer fence .
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .

hammer artist invest@@ s three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main pieces , the Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated by Bible lyrics .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with gorgeous pictures .
in the beginning the picture was formulated for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary , the respective issues have been adapted , it can quite be quite inti@@ mid@@ ating .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble @-@ project for which he has taken an subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many issues of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerged are cycles that are devoted to topics like Kreu@@ zwe@@ g , Pl@@ agues , Comm@@ and@@ ments or pat@@ ernity .
this makes it spont@@ ane@@ ously fascinated by several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation also like for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his focus on art books .
and there is especially the author of Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who deal on the basis of painting with the respective Bible .
he interpreted the Bible from Ot@@ mar Old selected and so translated into present inter@@ relations . &quot;
these texts are like ver@@ bal mirror of al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible from Martin Luther and a set of the artist who formulated his very personal thoughts for their respective situation .
the cas@@ ket has golden letters .
thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of intimacy .
emotions were finally born at all trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Old , 1940 in Wern@@ iger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who raised the strict Protest@@ ant ruler of the Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the education happened time already by the Pi@@ pe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oth@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work on this , perhaps also to betra@@ y me with the Lord father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to help the art in the fastest time again and again : &quot; the perception of Bild@@ wel@@ ten is shaped today by re@@ kl@@ ame , and that &apos;s noisy .
symbol@@ ism is promised .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures have always something mysterious and are not decoration .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Oth@@ mar Alt aims to allow the viewer to take a look at the pictures , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for his opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; who has always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like it , as he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I do not notice the Bible completely , but that is selected for him to be important , also mysterious themes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not co @-@ operation on eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the images , the text explains only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created a images of the Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ √∂h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Oth@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for M@@ √∂h@@ ler both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als and can@@ yon mak@@ eup - is presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened to the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
construction starts for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans made , place found , corporations tas@@ ked , petro@@ leum for a circuit course : one year later almost everything was done - but still before the official inaugur@@ ation of the BM@@ X , was thus close .
om@@ issions in politics and administr@@ ations for publishers , especially among the residents who do not toler@@ ate the rail@@ ways .
so , hill is taken from above , new place - now with formal planning and application for construction permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approval will come in October , I could announce the first congreg@@ ation in Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year has happened more visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works at former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees from 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga clearly states a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the football is responding to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; situation in Germany and ensures protection of his aid in tackling the upcoming problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that is the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as no one can say in principle , it is not about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interested in the handle on this subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ Chief Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday at the ch@@ anc@@ tuary and meet there the State &apos;s wife √ñ@@ zo@@ ƒü@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly be a central role on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football could be and wants to help .
but the decisive ordination has to place the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German football team has therefore expanded its refugee @-@ initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; declared kidney s@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
again , some Bundes@@ liga are also supporting this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already this weekend , the 36 professional is a clear sign if they are on the left tri@@ kot@@ ka , instead of the usual Sponsor@@ en@@ logos ( Her@@ mes ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that all are to help , where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ms. Rud@@ i V√∂l@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and recorded the project as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee @-@ drama starts every one , none of them can see . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can play football fans , no , we need to use our radiation , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoff@@ enheim managing director Peter Res@@ in spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
the EM qualification game against Hungary at this Friday invites the national team of women 100 refugees to Halle / Saale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach describes the support of refugees as &quot; a great community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ ensee had one in their places have started own projects , be great .
just as great is that small and smallest associations are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we have spent , is lived in football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year the association will be offering 300 000 Euros for the integration of refugees in each case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ver@@ eine had already launched the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ Pre@@ dec@@ ef is lost in an accident
the fore@@ head of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has shown several reports according to a fall in early July the le@@ ft@@ ist eye .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the accident at the staircase in the House of his brother in the USA , he fell to midnight on a water @-@ o@@ cul@@ ars , which he carried in the left hand reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business week &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s almost ble@@ eding , was impot@@ ent , then has just out to get out to the road - that tells us so last week , &quot; cited the &quot; Wi@@ i &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could end his work .
&quot; in early October we meet in front of the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board of Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Plat@@ ner .
the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &apos; fully working . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; S√ºd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thurs@@ days ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group .
&quot; I am full for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I got all the time in regular contact with the Super@@ vis@@ ory board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; SZ . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t frequently comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to come to the public with such personal history , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SZ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said something to happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; important to stand up once you have fallen . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen besides sk@@ ir@@ mish ...

football : Bv@@ B without re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussia Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco re@@ us will stop in the first group game of Europe League .
the national player will be sent to the table pilot of the Bundes@@ liga as well as in the du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 07 : 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether res@@ us will be back on Sunday at the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel towards Leverkusen , let the BV@@ B Coach open again : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high stress of his professionals , Tu@@ chel will change his tri@@ bal not just on the re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ e@@ position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller assumes the place of tri@@ bal Roman B√ºr@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the soccer teacher the world master .
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller arrives in the future in all of Europe &apos;s league games , but Tu@@ ckl@@ es left open .
with high probability , he will also manage the second game .
the for@@ ged statement by fellow players re@@ us , that the Fin@@ alist record for BV@@ B in the Europe League will be the goal , holding mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l is understandable : &quot; with this , Marco has@@ n &apos;t been so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants to lead the cutting edge for Germany
Germany due to the will of the federal government shall be a pioneer in the change of the car technology leader .
the Federal kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday a strategy for Strateg@@ ies from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobr@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dobr@@ ing@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Autom@@ esse I@@ AA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new Mobile Age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the automated driving and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less steep , &quot; Dobr@@ ind@@ t said .
he wants to discuss the issue with its am@@ t@@ sk@@ ol@@ ites from the G@@ 7 states , which also come together with representatives of industry .
the Strateg@@ y@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier of the Ministry of Transport , among other things empha@@ sizes the importance of mobile broad@@ band construction and an excellent det@@ ach@@ ment on digital sign@@ boards .
the testing of new technology is currently being created a test track at the 9 motorway in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability @-@ risks wor@@ ship@@ ments &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and where necessary to adapt to the new developments &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus Germany is aiming for an international show that the permitted maximum speed limit for self @-@ driving cars from 10 at 130 square kilometers .
the federal government also wants to stand up for a change in the Vienna Convention , so far only man sees the human being as a driver .
at an automated driving account takes over , the car takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more suited to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras , which detect the environment and process data in sec@@ rec@@ y .
after one from the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving tests will be technically feasi@@ ble on motor@@ ways by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless the vehicles on public roads are far from 2020 to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
added value in the area of driver assistance systems , and the highly automated driving function at the Germany location makes the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of the P@@ PS can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD @-@ traffic commun@@ e S@@ √∂ren Bar@@ to@@ l .
but the issue of liability in the accidents and security of the personal data of the drivers must be clar@@ ified , but clearly clar@@ ified .
however , the German self @-@ driving cars still see skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA institute on behalf of the Test@@ sa Institute on behalf of the Pru@@ d@@ gan@@ zation Dec@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that self @-@ driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect in 20 years to believe 31 percent do not believe in it .
in France , 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed up to 20@@ 25 with autonom@@ ous cars , in the USA 33 percent .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
after a survey of digital tools , Bit@@ kom only seven percent would agree to complete control during the entire ride on all roads .
on the highway the flowing traffic could at least 15 percent imagine , in the St@@ au 45 percent .
good every veins would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and Doppel@@ beg@@ at Tis@@ cht@@ ennis @-@ EM
the D√ºssel@@ dor@@ fer will fight for jet@@ on at the cover from 25 September to 4 October only in the single .
the final decision will be due to the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title without the Timo &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bundest@@ ags J√∂rg Ro@@ √ü@@ kopf during the EM @-@ cur@@ sion in D√ºsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the draw@@ back , we are now no longer a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Single @-@ Europ@@ am@@ eister Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who carries the S@@ etz@@ liste in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , reminded of the EM 2013 in Sch@@ statt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo has also been missing and we have become Europ@@ am@@ eister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this should be based on our philosophy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the world @-@ list fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football fans Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has moved to a serious injury on the right side .
in the Champions League game at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven was taken the def@@ ender at a Tac@@ na of H√©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and changed after long treatment .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant ...
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) shows a combination of very big Mo@@ den@@ schau : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition at his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : DIS@@ PU@@ PP@@ ES , which , thanks to video @-@ proj@@ ections would be sc@@ ary humanity .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who became among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as B√ºh@@ nen@@ out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and with it that he put men in the skirts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m the En@@ f@@ ant of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was very easy , now it &apos;s genuine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om Om@@ stei@@ g on the run @-@ ste@@ g ) , which is seen from 18 September at the Kuns@@ thalle of the HY@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designers his initially func@@ tioned according to a look at his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he had been against it , for : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me seemed to be an exhibition a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made Montreal in Montreal in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful d@@ resses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Die@@ deren .
it comes to tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into that scar@@ c@@ ely any appearance of the man who has written history , without ever having completed an education .
chron@@ ologically , the look is not built , but it is a superb chore@@ ographic art work , for which much effort was operated : to fres@@ hen the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged .
14 tons of material made the makers according to information provided by the Cur@@ ators Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October day it was a special treat : a leather sk@@ irt out@@ fit with cor@@ set@@ t .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ ti@@ ers old Ted@@ dy is shown in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tender mo@@ vi@@ ous hearing of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good pu@@ pi@@ l and bad in football ) he attracted his Ted@@ dy b@@ ins and d@@ resses , Gau@@ l@@ tier .
playing with a pupp@@ et , his parents would not have allowed him to .
he later brought the design of fashion to himself later .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the dra@@ fts of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
but later I bought it naturally .
for his first own Mo@@ den@@ schau he did not pay the mod@@ els .
they got nothing , we were allowed to keep the pl@@ ot@@ tos .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ N@@ ian
earlier it went to the long Stick@@ ers in and around Pl@@ auen to make meters .
the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and points were produced in large quantities for customers , which they worked as blan@@ kets and gar@@ din@@ ers .
this alone is not working anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ entr@@ ys Pl@@ auen .
instead , the mode is again important .
in the initial times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze played a greater role , then was pushed away by home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as an niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : tip in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and in regional tram .
to ever find the so @-@ called Vintage @-@ Mode , which cuts in past sty@@ li@@ stic periods , an acceler@@ ation order .
those who are not operated in the textile industry in Germany is no longer the market .
they are already doing the half of all orders .
in cooperation with nine other companies , Mo@@ entr@@ ys Pl@@ auen together with nine other companies is a member of the bra@@ ch@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they may carry the protected label .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past 15 years , about 80 per cent of the sales are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
private dealers and also the wholes@@ ale are almost no more .
our products are hardly accessible to customers in this way .
the mass @-@ ware today is made much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
its weak@@ est export of export , up to Russia and the USA .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association tries also by environmental awareness to points , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer by the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; for this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt is added : &quot; this also applies to the used materials . &quot;
diplom@@ a teacher Ute Schmidt teaches in the snow Se@@ eberger of the West@@ Sax@@ on Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - an der fac@@ ulty for Applied Art - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ ies and points .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and plants grown especially economically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore an existing design is often only slightly different to keep a customer base .
a few years ago clothing designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter rep@@ ented the historical snow @-@ tops .
the machine runs small ch@@ icks in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ smith &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ffs was inspired by it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier I could start with traditional rac@@ ers tip nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they use the snow@@ brass show for their jewelry .
in an elaborate procedure she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the theme of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pl@@ au@@ ener &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the United States , to Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in ple@@ ats and surroundings and who want to have a reminder .
so I see my jewelry as a modern Ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
legends should not be st@@ ir but Disney is still interested in a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not a new feature , but a kind of continuation , the 20 years after the first movie with the magical child &apos;s maid .
this is about the experience of the N@@ anny with the Banks Banks family period in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins over 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already clear : Rob Marshall , recently with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI pushed to open the economy broader to the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must open wider to the outside to promote growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President Xi Jin@@ ping on the Tuesday of a group that was charged with the ste@@ ering of reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should apply to foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business development , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a discussion at the 16th meeting of the Central leadership group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
promoting new thorough and reforms will boost new momentum and vitality , and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; said Xian .
the leadership group adopted a series of guidelines , including a neg@@ ative list to the regulation of the market , relax in the border controls policy , promoting the state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , priv@@ ates capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the inhabitants cl@@ an system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a negative list will be created , sectors and corporations will not be identified for investments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system will gradually be tested and improved by testing programs .
the initiative is of importance as it indicates the market a greater role in the access of resources , a legally nation@@ alized business environment and open the market open , &quot; the statement said .
the government will also temp@@ ted controls on the powers transferred to the company and make sure companies decide how they conduct their business .
the statement also stated that China border regions will allow to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas will be opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change policies towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign financial businesses and provide better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it is made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; facilit@@ ated by the requirements and facilitate the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law of lawyers to guarantee , exercise their activity , and deplo@@ y professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders like Li@@ u Yun@@ nan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli was part of the report published after the meeting .
EU wants to double its mer@@ cury border in rob@@ ber@@ man

the Food organization Food@@ watch , which is one of the most suitable work@@ sp@@ ap@@ ier of the EU , critic@@ ized the plans : &quot; risks and side effects inf@@ alli@@ zed industrial and environmental policy are forwar@@ ded with full weight of pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt by Food@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt are supposed to be the bor@@ dering of nerve po@@ isons for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ ks or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; raised by one to two milli@@ gram Mercury per kil@@ ogra@@ m of fish .
great pre@@ dat@@ ory men have already been so heavily stra@@ ined with mer@@ cury , that in the basis of the still valid limits , approximately 50 per cent of the length are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling of the limits , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ negoti@@ able .
in return for this attrac@@ ting the EU seeks Food@@ watch the thres@@ hold of other fish@@ ings of currently 0,5 milli@@ gram to exac@@ erb@@ ated by 0.1 milli@@ gram to 0.1 milli@@ gram of Mercury per kil@@ ogra@@ m .
Food@@ watch describes this however as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller species @-@ fish , such as car@@ p are usually so low , that they already keep the planned high@@ s already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lo@@ wering of Kl@@ einf@@ isch was therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distr@@ actions that helps the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; declared Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mercury is one for the people of high @-@ toxic heavy metals that are highly grown over the food chain , above all in prey .
the German government war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already low quantities can be found particularly in the inf@@ ants of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Environment explains on his home page in terms of current maximum @-@ rights , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard to the general population is not to be expected . &quot;
Mercury is reinforced especially by coal burning into the environment .
the German cohesion plants , according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry for the Green Bundestag Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bock is more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total consumed in Germany .
the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish is approximately in El@@ be , the Rhine and the Danube , &quot; permanently and over@@ run , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; had quot@@ ed in March of the paper .
in the past year Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings issued before Mercury in fish are already among the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system RA@@ S@@ FF .
