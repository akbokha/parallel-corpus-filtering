if required , a Re@@ ag@@ enz can be stored under the recommended retail conditions , so the required properties should stay for at least one year .
the failure of a Re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es in flu@@ essi@@ mis@@ tic form according to label , most satis@@ fies a year after the last satis@@ fact@@ or@@ rh@@ age .
based on the label release , for drying re@@ agents , it is aimed at the results of the holding phase ; it is approved by the government authorities .
dry re@@ agents are kept in a atmosphere of in@@ stituted gas or in a vacuum tube , in which they have dried , and that it is closed , that no humidity can be penet@@ rating .
a dry down@@ stream must lose at the most 0,5 v.@@ H. of its weight when there is more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg for using a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg .
to prevent the cause of bacterial growth , the monetary authorities can be added to anti @-@ sep@@ tic drugs and / or antibiotic treatment , provided the Re@@ ag@@ enz with the added substance to be the requirements of specific@@ ity and efficacy .

as long as long as the international exchange of re@@ agents to blood types should not be artificial , at least as long as long as international agreement came into a consistent system .
re@@ agents to blood @-@ determination are protected in such way and in such cases , that which in a container is not only able to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity has to be so great that the content may be used to carry this protocol described in this protocol .
the Manufac@@ turers laboratory has written about all production stages and checks of re@@ agents to the blood @-@ determination of written records .
appropriate samples of all issued re@@ agents are so long from the laboratory &apos;s laboratory , until with a number of likely can be assumed that Char@@ ge is no longer used .
to the blood types of re@@ agents , substances can contain substances of human , animal species ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these are the most effective percentage that others are necessary to ampli@@ fy the efficacy and maintenance of stability .
for technical reasons , this re@@ agents is divided according to the origin of its real estate in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin exclusively contain substances of human origin or that animal or plant re@@ agents can not contain substances of human origin .
on each individual container is a black on white printed label in English and French , the following data contains : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,

each shipment has been issued according to this protocol , according to this protocol , according to this protocol .
anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood out of the group B , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of the group A .
anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ ination , i.e. those in A and AB , including the sub@@ group A and AB , including the sub@@ group A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B . there is no human red blood cells that contain no A antigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the back of the de@@ fun@@ ct , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ es of anti @-@ A blood types , or an appropriate sample set against in@@ flo@@ ods of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells .
in no case , the efficacy of the Ser@@ bs must not be found in no case less than 64 international units per ml .
anti @-@ A serum is mixed with one of the same amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent from A@@ 1 , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells , so if the same attempt is un@@ solved with the un@@ rede@@ emed un@@ solved , but un@@ th@@ inner International standard prepar@@ es of the anti @-@ A bleeding group or a default prepar@@ es for the same Avi@@ dity will be carried out .

in no case , the efficacy of the Ser@@ bs must not be found in no case less than 64 international units per ml .
the anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also have an easy recognition ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum can be mixed with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination is carried out within the same time , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ es of anti @-@ A blood types or using a standard prepar@@ atory process .

in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain the antigen , the serum can contain the possibility to contain blood cells , the Do @-@ An@@ tigen .

anti @-@ C serum is obtained from blood of one or more people who are immune through the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with listing of human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not containing the human red blood cells that do not contain the C antigen .
these results are therefore specific to the C antigen only specifically , if the tested blood cells are welded in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent of cooking solution .
the Tit@@ er of the anti @-@ C virus ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ d@@ dee @-@ blood cells .

in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective under the proven reaction conditions at the same time .
if there is a serum for use in the test according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation time is supposed to show a reaction to all types of red blood cells that show a reaction , not less than in the ant@@ aneous antibodies .
