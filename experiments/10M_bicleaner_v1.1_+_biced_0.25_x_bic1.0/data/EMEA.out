this document is a summary of the European Medic@@ ines Association ( EP@@ AR ) , in which the Committee for Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies in order to get recommendations to the application of the drug .
if you need more information about your disease or their treatment , please read the packing b@@ eil@@ age ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or write to your doctor or pharm@@ acies .
if you wish to wish further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg melting tablets ( tablets , which solve itself in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ res Thin@@ k and Spe@@ aking , Hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or satur@@ ation of things that are not available ) , missions and mental illness . in which the patient &apos;s disease episodes ( Peri@@ ods are altern@@ ately high ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal tuning .
Abi@@ li@@ fy the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ure for the treatment of moderate to severe adhesi@@ ves , and to prevent Man@@ ri@@ sts in patients who have been on the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is applied to fast control of increased lack or behavi@@ ours , if the oral intake of medication is not possible .
for both diseases , the solution can be applied , or the melting tablets in patients are applied , the can@@ yons of tablets is prepared .
in patients who use other drugs simultaneously , the same as Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adapted to the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy .
this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of the nerve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l is thought to be regarded as &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the receptors for neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( also ser@@ ot@@ onin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l such as 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in lower dimensions as the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the receptors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ cycline @-@ schi@@ zophren@@ ia with schi@@ zophren@@ ia and bio@@ pol@@ er , Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain to norm@@ alize psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and will occur .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy , the re @-@ launch of the symptoms , was investigated in three studies , up to a year .
the efficacy of injection solution was reduced in two trials in 805 patients with schi@@ zophren@@ ia or similar diseases associated with increased accidents , over a period of two hours compared with placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy has been associated with Hal@@ li@@ fy to 347 patients with Hal@@ oper@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recovery to 160 patients who had already been stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ectors was conducted in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance , which rose to an increased accidents , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change of symptoms of patients based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also led studies to investigate how the body reduces the melting of the body and the solution to take up ( up ) .
in both studies with the injection solution showed that Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly improved significantly in the symptoms of the symptoms , which received placebo .
in application for the treatment of bi@@ polar , Abi@@ li@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies are more effective than placebo .
in addition to some 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the res@@ am@@ ination of the res@@ cu@@ res manganese episodes in previously treated patients and when it was given in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ectors in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms increased by increased accidents and were similar effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( free movement ) , head@@ aches ( so@@ unding ) , head@@ aches ( so@@ unding ) , s@@ wollen joint ( so@@ aked ) , red hyper@@ bari@@ c tion ( elevated memory production ) , ti@@ red@@ ness and exhaus@@ tion , Ru@@ hel@@ o@@ vers@@ ity , In@@ som@@ nie ( sleep disorders ) , and anxiety disorders .
the European Committee for Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) has concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy the treatment of schi@@ zophren@@ ia and led to the prevention of schi@@ zophren@@ ia and in which the Ottoman Ep@@ iso@@ den on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l spoke , compared to the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control and behavi@@ ours of patients with schi@@ zophren@@ ia or in patients with Ottoman Ep@@ iso@@ den in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , if a oral treatment is not suitable , compared to the risks .
June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . , a approval of Abi@@ li@@ fy the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of a new Ottoman study in the Bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder and for the prevention of a new Ottoman study in patients that were mostly man@@ ische episodes and whose man@@ ische episodes were indicated on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day one day , regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages on a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , ir@@ respective of meals as a single agent or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ zophren@@ ia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder with patients ≥ 65 years was not detected .
back to the bigger sensitivity of this group of patients should be considered to be considered in lower initial dose , if clinical factors are justify , ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ racy dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the presence of su@@ ave diseases belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , was reported in some cases after the start , or after changing an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of a epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance , no increased superf@@ ood risk with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l in comparison to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l should be used in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ d@@ inf@@ ants or isch@@ emic heart disease , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure extraction ) or hypertension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 late dy@@ qu@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , one year or less endurance , there were occasional reports on during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l occurring Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
if you occur with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y treated patients and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , it should be noted to reduce the dose to reduce or treatment .
if a patient of signs and symptoms , developed on a m@@ ns , or even a clear fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , will be sold .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l should be used in patients with cra@@ b cases in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or with cra@@ bs that are related with Kra@@ m@@ ell@@ an@@ cies in relation to be used .
56 - 99 years old ) with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l patients who are associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l , an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there was one of these studies , a study with fi@@ xer dos@@ ing , a significant relationship between the dosage and the appeal for adverse events in with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia , in some cases extremely associated with ket@@ ac@@ acia , or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em Kom@@ a or death , was reported in patients with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there is no precise risk ass@@ ess@@ ments for hyper@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia events in with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs treated with the same amount .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , poly@@ phen@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) were observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus are being monitored regularly in terms of glucose levels .
in general , this weight gain a weight gain in schi@@ zophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to anti@@ pol@@ l use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics in which weight gain as a side effect , respectively , and an in@@ healthy life and could result in severe complications .
as a result of the primary effect from Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system is necessary , when Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medication ( see section 4 ) .
the H2 ant@@ ag@@ onist F@@ amo@@ ti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid Blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption of Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered as a clin@@ ically relevant .
in a clinical study , a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibitor ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l , 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to expect other highly effective inhibitors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as fluor@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects , and therefore , similar dos@@ ing effects should be made .
for CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; Light &apos; ) , the common application can cause a highly effective inhibitors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations from Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l resulting in comparison to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metast@@ ases .
if one knows the common offering of ket@@ ac@@ on@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefit should potential the potential risks in the patients .
other highly effective inhibitors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease , should have similar effects and should therefore be performed similar dos@@ ing solutions .
after setting the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibitors should be fixed at the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y on the dose height before the beginning of the adjuvant therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be given together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , a steady increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l have no significant effect on the metabolism of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
the people should be too difficult to notify their doctor , if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l .
because of the inadequate data to safety in humans and due to that in re@@ production studies , this drug can not be applied to the pregnancy , because the potential benefit is clearly the potential risk for fet@@ us .
however , in other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , the patients should be warned against it , dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , to operate , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l has not affect any negative impact on them .
the following effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the below side effects is defined after the following criteria : often ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ zophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l , a total reduction of incidence ( 25,@@ 8 % ) were treated compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ ab@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients receiving Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients receiving placebo .
in a different controlled @-@ term study on 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % for patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients receiving O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ische Ep@@ iso@@ den in Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - in a controlled trial period of 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with Hal@@ oper@@ dol treatment .
in another study on 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was diagnosed in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term development phase over 26 weeks of placebo @-@ controlled trial was the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo @-@ treated patients .
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
enhancement of the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ atin @-@ phosp@@ ho@@ kinase ) , generally temporarily observed and asy@@ leu@@ cine , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of the treated patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects that occur in connection with an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , they include the mal@@ ari@@ ous neurological syndrome , late dy@@ sp@@ in@@ esia and increased mortality in older dementia patients , Hyper@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia and Diabetes M@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials , and since the market launch , un@@ intended or inten@@ tionally over@@ burden of Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l alone have been observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg , and without a death follow .
although there is no information about the efficacy of a col@@ lusion with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that h@@ emo@@ aly@@ sis is in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefit , since Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma proteins .
it is alleged that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ zophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- receptors and a coded effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptors are conve@@ yed .
Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l showed high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor as well as an excessive aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , for ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ gen and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
offering treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily subjects showed a dos@@ ing reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the foot of us cau@@ dat@@ us and the coup .
in three placebo controlled short time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) 1,@@ 228 &quot; s patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms as a statistically significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms .
in a half @-@ controlled research programme , 52 of the proportion of resp@@ ecting patients who held a response to the study medi@@ ating , both groups similar to groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ el@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of brass , which were defined as secondary study targets , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression scale , showed a significantly stronger recovery than in Hal@@ oper@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ zophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was 34 % in Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l Group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational two @-@ blind study of schi@@ zophren@@ ia ( N = 18 or 13 % of evalu@@ able patients ) in significantly less patients receiving a reduction of at least 7 % compared to an average weight of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ( i.e. an average weight of approx . 5.@@ 6 kg ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled Mono@@ therapy studies with more flexible dosage more than 3 weeks with a Ottoman or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I error , Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo @-@ driven efficacy in the reduction of reduction in symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled Mono@@ therapy study conducted over 3 weeks with fi@@ xer dosage in patients with a Ottoman or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I error , Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l was not over@@ superior to placebo .
in two placebo @-@ and @-@ controlled mono@@ therapy studies in a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder with or without psycho@@ tic mercury , Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l showed a positive effect on placebo in week 3 and a positive effect , which was comparable to lithium or Hal@@ lu@@ dol show in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l also referred to a comparable share in patients with sympt@@ omatic re@@ mission of the man@@ ie on such as lithium or Hal@@ sen@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder with or without psycho@@ tic features , some 2 weeks did not appear on Li@@ thi@@ cker or Val@@ pro@@ at mono@@ therapy , showed an over@@ negative efficacy in the reduction of sensitive symptoms as opposed to mono@@ therapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long term phase over 74 weeks in Ottoman patients with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l , who showed a re@@ mission in response to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly for the prevention of a return .

in Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l , there is no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , and also showed no gender effects in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination .
a Pop@@ ular @-@ specific analysis for Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of significant differences regarding ethnic cleansing and the impact of the smokers on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic characteristics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe renal in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy subjects .
a single dose study of patients with different gra@@ zing liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed a significant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of the C , which is not sufficient to pull shots on their metabolic capacity .

in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational two @-@ blind study of schi@@ zophren@@ ia ( N = 18 or 13 % of evalu@@ able patients ) in significantly less patients receiving a reduction of at least 7 % compared to an average weight of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ( i.e. an average weight of approx . 5.@@ 6 kg ) .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled Mono@@ therapy study conducted over 3 weeks with fi@@ xer dosage in patients with a Ottoman or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I error , Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l was not over@@ superior to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l was compared to healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ max value of the solution and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 a result of the duc@@ ers of sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gate of the hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ asis treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l is determined in the recommended clinical dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times of the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) .
these effects of rab@@ bits were used for dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ fold in the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is applied to fast control of aging and behavi@@ ors in patients with schi@@ zophren@@ ia or in patients with Ottoman episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when an oral therapy is not attached .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically made , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l inj@@ ector has been finished and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l .
to increase the res@@ or@@ ption and to minimi@@ ze the vari@@ ability , a injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep in the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle under revers@@ ing of obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) , depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicine or ac@@ ut therapy can be ordered ( see section 4.5 ) .
if you have a further treatment treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y melting tabl@@ ettes or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y Solution to take place .
there are no investigations to the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l inj@@ ectors in patients with asp@@ ir@@ cul@@ ess and behavi@@ oral disorders that were different as schi@@ zophren@@ ia and man@@ ische Ep@@ iso@@ den of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if a par@@ tis@@ ing therapy with ben@@ odi@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l inj@@ ector is necessary , the patients should be observed regarding a extreme naval or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l inj@@ ectors are not liable for patients with alcohol or drug po@@ is@@ oning ( caused by using or illegal medicine ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l should be used in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ d@@ inf@@ ants or isch@@ emic heart disease , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure extraction ) or hypertension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , one year or less endurance , there were occasional reports on during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l occurring Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , mus@@ cular awareness , changing awareness and signs of indications ( un@@ regular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ opping , sweat , and heart rhythms ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , poly@@ phen@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) were observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus are being monitored regularly in terms of glucose levels .
a weight gain in general in schi@@ zophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ pol@@ er Man@@ ie due to anti@@ pol@@ l use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain as a side effect is observed , or an un@@ healthy life and could result in severe complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ an was compared with the following treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l , in a study that was applied intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly ( 15 mg dosage ) as mono@@ cul@@ arly intra@@ mus@@ cular ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly at the same time .
105 The H2 @-@ Ant@@ ag@@ onist F@@ amo@@ ti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid Blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption of Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered as a clin@@ ically relevant .
for CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; net &quot; ) metabolism of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 a determined met@@ al@@ cul@@ ators of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 with high @-@ effective inhibitors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations from Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l .
other highly effective inhibitors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and H@@ IV@@ - Prot@@ ease , should have similar effects and should therefore be performed similar dos@@ ing solutions .
after setting the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibitors should be fixed at the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y on the dose height before the beginning of the adjuvant therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) received intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of the Sed@@ an was larger compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l .
the following effects occur in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) as placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the below side effects is defined after the following criteria : often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible in clinical studies with oral Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients receiving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients receiving placebo .
in another study on 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was diagnosed in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in long @-@ term development phase over 26 weeks of placebo @-@ controlled trial was the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo @-@ treated patients .
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
level of CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ phosp@@ ho@@ kinase ) , general temporarily , and asy@@ leu@@ cine , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of the treated patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects that occur in connection with an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , they include the mal@@ ari@@ ous neurological syndrome , late dy@@ sp@@ in@@ esia and increased mortality in older dementia patients , Hyper@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia and Diabetes M@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ ours was the Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l inj@@ ecting solution with statistically significant improvement of chor@@ oidal / behavior disorders compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ oper@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar distur@@ ban@@ ces , it was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms and behavior disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean follow @-@ up of the baseline value on the PAN@@ SS @-@ Compon@@ ent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.8 per placebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.7 for Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes of patients with mixed atri@@ ots , a similar efficacy in relation to the population population was observed , but a statistical significance was observed due to a reduction of patients .
in three placebo controlled short time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) 1,@@ 228 &quot; s patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) compared to placebo a statistically significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms .
in a half @-@ controlled research programme , 52 of the proportion of resp@@ ecting patients who held a response to the study medi@@ ating , in both groups similar to Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ f ( 73 % ) .
current values of brass , which were defined as secondary study targets , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression scale , showed significantly stronger improvements than at Hal@@ oper@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ zophren@@ ia ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was 34 % in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational two @-@ blind study of schi@@ zophren@@ ia ( N = 18 or 13 % of evalu@@ able patients ) in significantly less patients receiving a reduction of at least 7 % compared to an average weight of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ( i.e. an average weight of approx . 5.@@ 6 kg ) .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I error , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which was partially referred to on Li@@ thi@@ cker or Val@@ pro@@ at mono@@ therapy , showed an excessive efficacy in the reduction of cancer symptoms as opposed to mono@@ therapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week trial , Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l had achieved a re@@ mission in response to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return .
Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is larger than the first 2 hours after intra@@ mus@@ cular injection of 90 % larger than AU@@ C following the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time until reaching the maximum plas@@ mas@@ eg@@ els in 1 to 3 hours .
the offering of Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l inj@@ ector was carried out by rats and monkeys , and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target group after 10 mg of intra@@ mus@@ cular exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were significantly reduced by the maximum of 30 mg intra@@ mus@@ cular exposure .
in studies of re@@ productive toxicity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns relating to mat@@ ernity exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) on the maximum of the therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies of Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ er@@ ation , Tox@@ ic@@ oxi@@ ity , Gen@@ ot@@ oxi@@ ity and the pel@@ ic@@ ity potential had no special dangers involved in human beings .
toxicity of significant effects were observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum dose or exposure at people ; so they have only limited for clinical use only limited or no meaning .
the effects of a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent side reduction in rats at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 60 mg / kg ) per day ( the 10 times the middle @-@ hour state exposure at 60 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of people ) .
moreover , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ asis of sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gate of the hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ ons were determined according to the recommended clinical dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81 times of the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) .

in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neutral density &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ or@@ ative curi@@ osity during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
for sens@@ or@@ ischer d@@ rop@@ ath@@ ie degree 3 , the treatment is to break down to 1 or 2 , while the subsequent cycles must be reduced to the dose .
there are currently sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in people with mild to moderate bre@@ ads of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4th and 5.2 ) .
there were no trials with patient suffering from kidney function and there are no sufficient data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in people with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data to un@@ imagin@@ able and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound Nan@@ op@@ o@@ dd@@ ity of pac@@ litaxel , which could show significantly more pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other formulation of pac@@ litaxel could ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction should be ordered , the medicine should be effective immediately and a sympt@@ omatic treatment , and patient may not be treated with pac@@ litaxel with pac@@ litaxel .
in the patient , no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be launched back to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the throm@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ment has increased back to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function ( Bi@@ li@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
in a clear case with Abra@@ x@@ ane in connection to car@@ di@@ ot@@ oxi@@ ity , cardiovascular problems are not unusual , especially in patients with former anth@@ ra@@ cycline @-@ treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
in case of patients following the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diarrhea , these can be treated with the common anti@@ em@@ eti@@ ka and con@@ sti@@ zing funds .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be practic@@ ed in pregnant or for women in the bare age , that is not practic@@ ing , except for the treatment of mother with pac@@ litaxel is in@@ compar@@ ably handy .
women in the bare age should be done during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable disp@@ ensing method .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , will be carried out while and up to six months after the treatment of no child .
male patients were advised to advise the treatment over a sper@@ ma@@ ker@@ age service because the therapy with abra@@ x@@ ane has the possibility of an irre@@ versi@@ bly in@@ fer@@ tility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane may cause side effects like fatigue ( very often ) and dizziness ( often ) that can work on the transport and ability to serve the ability of machines .
the most common and most important events of events are listed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the cancer clinical phase III trial every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ( 79 % of patients ) and was fast re@@ versi@@ bly and dos@@ ing ; Leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / d@@ L ) was observed in 46 % of the patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients and has been severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / d@@ L ) .
in table 1 , the side effects are listed , which occurred in conjunction with the offering of Abra@@ x@@ ane as a mono@@ therapy for each dose and indications in studies have occurred ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tic @-@ n@@ ase in blood , increased blood sugar , increased blood sugar , increased blood sugar in blood , reducing potassium in blood of heart disease :

Ru@@ hel@@ o@@ is@@ 1 : the incidence of hyper@@ sensitivity calculations is calculated based on a defined case in population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported to voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency is possible and it was not possible to be established using these events .
pac@@ litaxel is a anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules which promotes the con@@ junc@@ tival mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tubes and the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by inhibit@@ ing its land@@ oly@@ sis .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a selective in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vit@@ ale Inter@@ phase and the mit@@ o@@ tic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ anians was medi@@ ated to the endotheli@@ al cells in endotheli@@ al cells and in @-@ vitro studies , demonstrated that the presence of Alb@@ anians in the transport of pac@@ litaxel led by the endotheli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved progression @-@ based transport by the GP @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ ating recorder and is based on the alb@@ umin@@ ous Prot@@ eins SP@@ ARC ( ro@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) in the field of tumours .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ linked studies and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a randomized Phase III study study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of a in@@ fusion more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion more than 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
these multi @-@ centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a total of 3 weeks in combination with pac@@ litaxel in the form of a allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 than 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
in the inclusion in the study , 64 % of the patients had an affected general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ aged metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ ones .
previously , 14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % only had a adjuvant Chemo@@ therapy , 40 % only for met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and 19 % for metast@@ ases and the adjuvant treatment .
9 The results for the general contact rate and progression @-@ free survival and survival for people who received &gt; First @-@ Line @-@ therapy , are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ oxi@@ ity versus pac@@ litaxel was evaluated by improvement of a degree of patients who lived at a time during the therapy for peripheral neurop@@ athy for 3 patients .
the natural course of peripheral neurop@@ rop@@ ath@@ ie to bas@@ eline based on the cum@@ ulative toxicity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ litaxel to 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the drug exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analo@@ g@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intraven@@ ous treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , pac@@ litaxel was the pac@@ litaxel concentration of multi @-@ phase design .
the average volume of volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high volume volume is based on a wide @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or turn@@ out bond with pac@@ litaxel .
in a study with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic characteristics of pac@@ litaxel was compared with intraven@@ ous 30 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane using the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 .
in combination with pac@@ litaxel was higher ( 43 % ) as a solvent containing pac@@ litaxel injection , and also the distribution volume was higher ( 53 % ) .
published in the published literature on in @-@ vitro clinical studies of the human liver micro@@ scope and tissues is reported that pac@@ litaxel contributed to the first line ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ litaxel and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ litaxel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane compared to patients with metastatic breast cancer in patients with metastatic breast cancer -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ litaxel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ litaxel , which has a large @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ ditions .
however , over the age of over 75 years are only available only a few of those who participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was found at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and prior to light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ litaxel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ carcin@@ ogenic medicine and as well as in other potentially toxic substances should be careful in use with abra@@ x@@ ane .

• Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the drug with ( technical information ) , lab@@ eling and packing @-@ line . • With clear display of the product acci@@ dental cooling boxes for transportation through the patients .
this means that this is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and is the same substance ( also &quot; reference advice &quot; ) .
in patients with normal blood parameters , patients can occur in patients with blood trans@@ fusion complications in case of blood trans@@ fusion complications before it is not possible , in which an blood loss is expected to expect a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml .
treatment with drainage has to be initiated under supervision of a medicine that has been shown in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a ha@@ emor@@ rh@@ age , Ab@@ se@@ amed is to be inj@@ ected into a v@@ ene .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or by the customer plan , unless they have an appropriate guidance .

the iron values of all patients are to control the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency , and iron base products should be given during the entire treatment .
in patients who received chemotherapy alone or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ emia is caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency or that the body is not sufficient to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
in addition , ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin will also be applied to increase the number of red blood cells and thus increasing the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell that has been incorporated into a gene ( DNA ) into the formation of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
se@@ amed was compared with administration as an injection in a study of 4@@ 79 patients who were compared with kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all of this study of participating patients was inj@@ ected at least eight weeks , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected into a v@@ ene before they were either finished or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
major indi@@ ces for the efficacy was the change of h@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ ation values between the beginning of the study and the reference period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
furthermore , the company also laid the results of a study in which the effects of the skin is discovered by the skin with the ones of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients who were infected with kidney problems , the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ ite values were killed in patients who were killed in the same size , as did those who continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in the same size .
compared with these patients who received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0,0@@ 63 g / d@@ L of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / d@@ L .
the most common side effects of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , the occasionally to symptoms of an en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) , such as sudden , st@@ ech@@ ing er@@ able head@@ aches and man@@ ner@@ ed head@@ aches .
absor@@ bs cannot be used in patients who are possibly excessive ( allergic ) against ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or one of the other components .
ab@@ uses as injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems since further studies are required to ensure that this is no allergy reactions .
the European Committee for Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) has concluded that the medicine was approved according to the regulations of the European Union , that the medicine was a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which was re@@ amed for the medical professionals in all Member States information , including information about the safety of the drug .
August 2007 , the European Commission &apos;s Medi@@ ce medicine P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG was approved in the European Union by the European Commission .
treatment of an@@ emia and reduction in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ om who received chemotherapy alone and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion was used due to the general status ( for example , cardiovascular status , an@@ emia at the beginning of the chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient in case of larger operating profit ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
in the reduction of foreign blu@@ ffs , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used in adults without iron deficiency in adults , where a high risk of trans@@ fusion companies can be expected .

the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / d@@ L ( 6,@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , except for pa@@ edi@@ atric patients in which the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ ular concentration between 9,5 and 11 g / d@@ L ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) should lie .
anom@@ ali@@ es@@ y@@ mpt@@ ome and conclusions can be different , depending on the age , sex and total disease of disease . therefore , the assessment of an individual clinical trial and disease resistance are required by the doctor .
a rise of h@@ emo@@ bell with more than 2 g / d@@ L ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
because of the vari@@ ability between patients , occasionally with a patient of individual h@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ ation values , or less than the h@@ emo@@ glo@@ bic target concentration .
in view of this h@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ vari@@ ability , about a corresponding dose management tries to achieve the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / d@@ L ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / d@@ L ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ ite value is more than 2 g / d@@ L ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month , or if the permanent h@@ emo@@ bell pairs is 12 g / d@@ L ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
the patients should be used to ensure that Epo@@ gin remains al@@ fa in the lowest dose dose , which is necessary for control of an@@ emia , an@@ emia , and an@@ emia , is applied .
this clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / d@@ or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher maintenance boxes in patients with initial an@@ emia ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .

Ac@@ la@@ sta will be applied to the treatment of the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bone jum@@ pers ) both in women after the exchange years as well as men .
it is applied in patients with a high freight risk ( bone breaks ) , including in patients who have suffered a low traum@@ atis@@ ed hip as with H@@ inf@@ ra ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease which changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hat@@ ch@@ inc@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection in a mus@@ cle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the use of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms of the in@@ fusion symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get may only be used by doctors , bringing experience in the treatment of these disease .
as the substance in Ac@@ la@@ sta same is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , became part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was investigated the number of verteb@@ ral and hat@@ ch@@ tures over a period of three years .
the second study comprised 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who had suffered a hat@@ ch@@ inc@@ ture ; it was investigated by the number of fra@@ c@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies in a total of 35@@ 7 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the efficacy was whether the concentration of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme which builds a bone heart rate ) in blood again or by at least 75 % compared to the initial figure .
in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rate in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ atop@@ ente ) was reduced over a period of three years compared to patients receiving placebo by 70 % .
in comparison of all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( or without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ os@@ kam@@ ente ) , the risk of hips was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hips fra@@ cture had 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients receiving placebo ( 139 from 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur in the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequently in in@@ fusion .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who are not sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ate or one of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney disease , reactions to the in@@ fusion section and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis ( die from bone tissue ) in Kiefer .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta represents re@@ conn@@ aissance material for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as the drug use , as well as similar material for patients , in which the side effects of the drug is analyzed , and it is noted when they turn to the doctor .
April 2005 , the European Commission on the Nov@@ arti@@ s Europ@@ harm Limited has been granted approval for the establishment of Ac@@ la@@ sta in the entire European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis with post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of fra@@ c@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atis@@ ed hips .
the patient information package includes : • The Pack@@ ages of contra@@ indications in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Additional charges of calcium and vitamin D , reasonable physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy nutrition • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms of serious side effects • W@@ ann to attention or nour@@ ish help .
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • at post @-@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of fra@@ c@@ tures , including in patients with a recently beaten low @-@ traum@@ atis@@ ed hips .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men it is recommended for intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atis@@ ed hip , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after surgery was recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should be prescribed by Ac@@ la@@ sta only by doctors , bringing experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ mission statement was observed in patients receiving therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very close to patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supplement of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently tested low @-@ traum@@ atis@@ ed hip , a initi@@ al@@ dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 , i.e. oral or intra@@ mus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended in front of the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by using the acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney function ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ fusion of &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta does not recommended as limited clinical experiences for this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and youth Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years , since data are missing at the un@@ imagin@@ able and effectiveness .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe renal in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since this patient population is only limited clinical experiences .
an existing hypo@@ kal@@ em@@ mie is before the beginning of the therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta by sufficient access of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the fast action of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid can develop a temporary , involving more sympt@@ omatic mort@@ ars , whose maximum is usually generally usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very close to patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supplement of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
advanced HER2 @-@ cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be used before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates to use a tooth tooth treatment .
for patients who need dental handles , there are no data available whether the interrup@@ ting of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the pine area .
the clinical evaluation was based on the basis of the treatment plan , based on the treatment plan of any patients , based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by using the acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of NSC 631570 was diagnosed with patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 by 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in Oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( P@@ FT , Horizon Rec@@ ur@@ ren@@ to Fra@@ cture trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fibrill@@ ation declined between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2,6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) undes@@ i@@ rable additives are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid was associated with kidney function , which is as a decrease in kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the variation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ fusion ( every year before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure was in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years , between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ sis and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum @-@ Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of treatment was observed in 1.8 % of patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta treated patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evalu@@ ations of the Labor@@ atories ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , in a large clinical study treated patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies in patients .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post @-@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to prevent clinical fra@@ c@@ tures according to a hat@@ ch@@ inc@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical fra@@ c@@ tures according to a recent study of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures , vitamin D @-@ D did not rout@@ inely measured the majority of the patient received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions according to the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions in the in@@ fusion section , such as Rö@@ ation , swelling , and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in pine wood , especially for cancer patients who have been reported to oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in Kiev area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid .
many of these patients had indications for local infections , including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients after apprenti@@ ces or other adverse events .

in case of an over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ cal , can be reached by offering of oral calcium and / or a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium @-@ glu@@ con@@ at .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 females aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a BM@@ D @-@ T score for 3 consecutive patients or an BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ Score score as ≤ 2.5 @-@ 2.5 with or without any indication of the existing body @-@ body weight .
effects on morph@@ omet@@ rical verteb@@ rates fra@@ c@@ tures significantly more than a period of three years and already after a year the frequency of one or several new verteb@@ rates ( see Table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients from 75 years and older had a 60 % reduction in the risk of verteb@@ rates compared to placebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on the in@@ fra@@ c@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed a constant effect over three years , which resulted in a reduction of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hips .
effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased the bone density at Len@@ den@@ wir@@ l acid , hat@@ s and on the dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 % of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine increased by 6.@@ 7 % , all the hat@@ s by 6.@@ 0 % , the shr@@ ine as by 5.@@ 1 % and the dist@@ al radius at 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology at 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ o@@ tic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken from a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es .
a micro@@ computer interface ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed in action with Ac@@ la@@ sta treated patients compared to placebo an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , serum and beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) serum were measured in the serum levels of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study period .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose rate reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output level after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin @-@ D @-@ Spiegel were not rout@@ inely measured but the majority of patients received a initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 , i.e. oral or intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study increased the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment compared to placebo @-@ treatment the BM@@ D treatment in total and sh@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als to all the periods .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led by 5.4 % compared to the placebo treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total and 4.3 % at Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als .
clinical efficacy in men in the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study , 508 men were random@@ ly assigned and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was judged after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction of clinical trials in men ; the frequency of clinical trials was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta treated male compared to 8.7 % compared to placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta to the once @-@ weekly gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , relative to the percentage of Len@@ den@@ e @-@ BM@@ D increased to 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the Wach@@ en@@ sta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years ago ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine bub@@ ble , corresponding to 2.@@ 6@@ fold to 3,@@ 0@@ triple @-@ specific upper limit value in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of the in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid was performed at an intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ronic once a day during 2 months .
in the combined results , after 6 months , a similar decline in the pain intensity and pain ratio was observed compared to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as a resp@@ ect@@ bon@@ der at the end of the six months study ( on the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
the study conducted by the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron study , compared with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared with 71 members of the Ris@@ ed@@ ron in treated patients , received during a mean follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the follow @-@ up phase .
one @-@ off and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 , and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which has proven itself as dos@@ ing independently .
accordingly , the plasma concentration increased rapidly at &lt; 10 % of the maximum speed after 4 h and &lt; 1 % to 24 h , followed by a long @-@ term phase , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid is a representative of a distance class , which is called bis@@ phosph@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis with post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone .
ab@@ dic@@ ated blood levels of sex hormon@@ es , especially Ö@@ stro@@ gens , who are formed from Andro@@ gens , play a role in more gradu@@ al loss of bone mass , which is observed in men .
when the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get takes place from the bone um@@ building to quickly , and a new bone material is im@@ min@@ ate , which makes bone material we@@ aker as normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by increasing the bone environment , thereby creating a normal bone formation and thus adding the bone .
if you are working in dental treatment or if you need a dental operation , keep your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta with other drugs , please inform your doctor , pharm@@ acies or care personnel , if you have taken other drugs / apply or have been used / applied , even if it does not require non @-@ prescription drugs .
for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you use drugs , it is known that they have the kidney .
in use of Ac@@ la@@ sta , with food and beverages , make sure that you can take a sufficient liquid before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
Oste@@ opor@@ osis The normal dose is 5 mg once per year , which is given to you from your doctor or care personnel as in@@ fusion into a V@@ ene .
if you have broken off the hips , it is recommended to take the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after surgery in the ma@@ est@@ ead land .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , who is given to you from your doctor or care personnel as in@@ fusion into a V@@ ene .
as Ac@@ la@@ sta for a long time , you will be able to have a further dose only after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions , so the calcium mirrors in your blood in the time after the in@@ fusion is not too low .
when Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get can work Ac@@ la@@ sta longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
when the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta missed out , S@@ get off immediately with your doctor or hospital in conjunction with a new date .
prior to the end of the therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta case you mentioned the termin@@ ation of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next medical doctor to come and discuss your doctor with your doctor .
side effects in connection with the first in@@ fusion are very frequently in ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , following the subsequent in@@ fusion , but less frequently .
fever and Schüt@@ ter frost , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is un@@ clear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart beat , but you should report your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you receive Ac@@ la@@ sta .

about allergic reactions , including more rarely cases of respiratory problems , neph@@ ew and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue , or in the wheel ) , was reported .
please inform your doctor , pharm@@ acies or care personnel , if one of the listed side effects are significantly affected or you notice side effects , which are not listed in any working formation .
if the medicine is not used directly , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
in patients with one recently l@@ itt@@ ens low @-@ traum@@ atis@@ ed hips , it is recommended to take the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hill .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients must be supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients who received a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
because of the fast action of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid can develop a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ omatic current , hypo@@ kal@@ ti@@ dal to develop their maximum within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is very close to patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supplement of calcium , according to at least twice a day 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with one recently l@@ itt@@ ens low @-@ traum@@ atis@@ ed hips , a initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 , i.e. oral or intra@@ mus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended in the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .

medicines in patients is applied to patients who need for health and non @-@ cosmetic reasons ( by providing re@@ conn@@ aissance aircraft for patients and doctors ) .
in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of a adi@@ posit@@ as ( BMI of 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BMI &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , moreover a or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dys@@ li@@ pi@@ sts ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years on the basis of the failure of data on the effectiveness and un@@ imagin@@ able .
La de@@ press@@ ants or vocal changes with de@@ press@@ ant symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , Su@@ itable was reported in up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.8 ) .
it cannot be applied to de@@ press@@ ant , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant should not be applied , because the benefit of treatment in the individual case exceeds the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
it also Also in patients who have - in addition to the adi@@ posit@@ as - no knowledge risks , de@@ press@@ ant reactions can occur .
members or other nearby persons ) have to be added that it is necessary to monitor the new symptoms of such symptoms and immediate medical advice , if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients Die efficacy and un@@ imagin@@ able of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant during the treatment of patients over 75 years were not sufficient .

a summary of the EP@@ AR on the public document is a summary of the European Parliament report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which the Committee for Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies in order to get recommendations to the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is applied to the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) in patients ( particularly important patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetic medication ) can be applied together with another diabetic medication ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
in addition , in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially important patients ) , the met@@ form@@ in alone are not satis@@ fact@@ ori@@ ed in the highest density dose alone .
in combination with a Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ fuel or insulin delivery , insulin can retain the previous dose of sulph@@ ate treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of sulph@@ ate drug is reduced ( low blood sugar ) .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be used better , and blood sugar level decreases , which allows type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated . patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ starch , in addition it received either Ac@@ tos or placebo .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ elled h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured as well as the blood sugar .
Ac@@ tos led to a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which indicates that blood glucose levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ therapy study showed the effect of additional treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ance in a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values to 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional treatment of placebo increased to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who were treated in addition a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % to 6 months , compared to patients receiving placebo .
the most common adverse events in relation to Ac@@ tos were visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( caused sensitivity ) , weight gain and hypo@@ an@@ esth@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to friction ) .
acet@@ ate may not be used in patients compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or another of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure , or diabetic ket@@ ac@@ acia ( high purity and blood cholesterol - in blood ) .
it was decided that in case of a single agent ( when used in a single use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , the met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
October 2000 , the European Commission to the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited has been approved for the establishment of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved , carry on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ inadequate due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatible with contra@@ indications ( see section 4.4 ) .
on the use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years are no data available , so the application will not be recommended in this age group .
patients who are vulnerable to the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. former heart attack or sympt@@ omatic cardiac failure ) to develop a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dosage .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain , or Ö@@ de@@ me , especially those with reduced cardi@@ al reserve .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain , and Ö@@ de@@ me , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and the existing disease infection was performed .
in this study showed an increase of reports about heart failure , however , which led to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased starting liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard ) or with other indications of liver illness , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one can not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range are increased , the liver enzyme are as soon as possible .
in the case a patient symptoms developed to indicate hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vomiting , sc@@ aff@@ om@@ nia , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark Har@@ n , are the liver enzyme values .
the decision to be continued whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , should be led by the laboratory of clinical trials .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent weight gain , which can be associated with fat deposits and is connected in some cases with a liquid level .
as a result of a h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution in therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a small reduction in medium h@@ emo@@ dynamics ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of h@@ emo@@ dynamics ) and insulin ( relative reduction of h@@ emo@@ dynamics with 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
as a result of the increased insulin sensitivity , the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used as oral branch or triple combination therapy with insulin @-@ sensitive therapy , insulin @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia .
after the launch , using Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ gn@@ an , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a presence or deteri@@ oration of a diabetic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction of visual acuity .
it is un@@ clear whether it should be taking a direct connection between the taking of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the emergence of a Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms , if people were dis@@ ruption of visual acuity , a suitable ophthalm@@ ological evaluation was supposed to be considered .
in a unified analysis of mel@@ odic adverse events in a randomized analysis of randomized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies have treated more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
Fra@@ ction @-@ incidence was 1.9 fragments per 100 patient @-@ years with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1,1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient who were treated with a comparative medi@@ ation .
in the Pro@@ active study , a study of 3,5 years in patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated with a comparative medi@@ ation .
patients were supposed to be aware of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy , or this one , is the treatment ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the interaction effects have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on had no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
changeable effects with medicines that are metabol@@ ised by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A Re@@ duc@@ t@@ as@@ inhibitor are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with vegetable fibro@@ ators ( P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibitors ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around the 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ icin ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ gate ) resulted in a reduction of AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is reduced in pregnancy , hypertension , and increased insulin resistance of the womb , thus reduces the availability of metabolic rate for serious growth .
very frequently &gt; 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( derived data is not available ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the Tur@@ g@@ or and Re@@ fraction of the lens , as they can be observed with other hypo@@ gly@@ ce@@ mic ingredients .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege included the tri@@ ples of the standard range beyond placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ starch .
in an out@@ come study in patients with advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was the frequency of a severe heart failure in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is about .
since the market launch , rarely over heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has been used in combination with insulin o@@ cer@@ in or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
a summary analysis of mel@@ odic adverse events in a randomized analysis of randomized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies have carried out over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with a comparative study .
in the period over a period of 3,5 years , Fra@@ c@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who treated with a comparative medi@@ ation .
in taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days were no symptoms on every day .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one appears to act a activation of specific core receptors ( per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome proliferation ) , which in animal model leads to an elevated insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ eton muscle cells .
it was shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose reduction in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ dal as mono@@ therapy was led over two years to examine the time to investigate the therapeutic effectiveness ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment rates ) .
at the time after two years after the start of therapy , blood glucose control could be defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of treated patients ( compared with 50 % of patients receiving G@@ lic@@ la@@ mide ) .
in a placebo controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar were randomized to inadequate response phase with insulin resistance , too , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patient who continued to have been insulin @-@ treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
in clinical trials , there was a statistically significant decrease in Alb@@ at@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ent in comparison to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( Mono@@ therapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 weeks for the study of type @-@ 2 diabetic .
in most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction of total plasma tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase of HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as minor , but clin@@ ically increased L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ stom@@ y the overall plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to placebo , there was no statistically significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels , while under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ mide levels were observed .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one did not only increase the tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de levels , this also improved the tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de @-@ view to the tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de absorption as well as hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de synthesis .
in the Pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular out@@ patient study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and the existing anti @-@ diabetic patients were randomized to the existing anti@@ diabetic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
after or@@ able application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on will be res@@ or@@ able , with the top concentrations of concentration on un@@ altered Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . usually 2 hours after application will be reached .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV contribution to the effectiveness in about three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , while relative to the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on could not have been demonstrated at the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Dig@@ oxin , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with mix@@ es ( P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibitor ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ icin ( P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ gate ) or the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
according to oral application of radioactive waste , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on human beings was found mainly in the barrels ( 55 % ) and a lower extent in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ wer@@ age of un@@ altered Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its metabolism are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers , whereby the rates of oral clearing of the womb were similar .
in to@@ xi@@ k@@ ological studies in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys have agreed to a repeated administration controller with h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , an@@ emia , and reversible , ec@@ centric , hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ es .
this is due to the fact that treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is reduced to blood glucose and increased insulin resistance of the womb , thereby reduces the availability of metabolic rate for serious growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , the increased incidence of hypertension ( male and female rats ) and tumours ( with male rats ) were induced in the ure@@ ment epithelial cells .
in a animal model of the family sy@@ om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ gn@@ ants led to a increased incidence of col@@ ont@@ ine .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on a side the mark &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
Fra@@ ction @-@ incidence was 1.9 fragments per 100 patient @-@ years with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1,1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient who were treated with a comparative medi@@ ation .
in the Pro@@ active study , a study of 3,5 years in patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated with a comparative medi@@ ation .
in a further study about two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ mide studied .
in clinical trials , over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in Alb@@ anians in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ent compared to the initial values .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was not only improved tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de levels , this also improved over a effect on the lac@@ y@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de absorption as well as hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
although the study evaluated the goal of its primary end@@ quality , non @-@ deadly chemical syndrome , leg amp@@ ar@@ isation and Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of leg arter@@ ies , lay the results that with the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on no cardiovascular risk .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
in a summary analysis of mel@@ odic adverse events in a randomized analysis of randomized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies have been treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients receiving a comparative study showed an increased incidence of bone bro@@ ods in women .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was not used in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 Diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as can no insulin produce , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is not able to use insulin insulin delivery .
in the study , after 12 weeks , concentration was measured in a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ elled h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c Spi@@ eg@@ els that showed that blood sugar are similar to similar to other human RPE .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied in patients who are possibly excessive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
moreover , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane might be adapted to the doses of acet@@ ate may be given together with a number of other medicines that can be carried out on blood sugar ( the complete list is the package list ) .
the European Committee for Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) has led to the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane during treatment of diabetes compared to the risks .
October 2002 , the European Commission granted the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for the establishment of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .

patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved , for example , due to a intense insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia breakdown sympt@@ om changes , and should be correspon@@ d@@ ited accordingly .
any modification regarding strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ kers , long @-@ term insulin ) , type of insulin ( derived from re@@ combin@@ ant DNA ) can cause that a change of dosage is required .
in case of using Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in patients a dose adjusting for patients is needed , this is necessary in the first dose or months after the change@@ over , or in the first weeks or months after the change .
some people who reported hypo@@ gly@@ ce@@ mic reactions according to a change of animal species , reported that the early warning sympt@@ om of a hypo@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia , was less pronounced or differently than in their previous insulin .
before travelling , which should take over a period of time zones , the patient should be noted that the Council of his physician , as such as they can do that , insulin and meals are applied to other times or taken .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is applied in patients who have already applied signs of cryst@@ alli@@ ations , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or Gi@@ cht@@ k@@ h@@ ubs ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. , greater pri@@ at@@ ological crystalline , which can lead to artic@@ ulated and bone surface versions ) .
if the ure@@ ment is typically increased from two to four weeks , more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ites , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , people can still occur rapidly ; therefore , patients will take place at least during the first six months under the treatment of Aden@@ ur@@ ic nor further medicines for the prevention of Gi@@ cht@@ an@@ cies .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had no organ transplan@@ tation , as it was not investigated for these groups .
in the first study , at which 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three human aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once a day 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( compulsory medicines ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a different drug for the treatment of hypertension ) .
in the second study , two dos@@ ages of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg per day ; patients with kidney problems received 100 mg per day .
major indic@@ ative for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ure@@ ment was in the blood with the last three measurements under 6 mg / d@@ L .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who diagnosed Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 from 269 ) to the patients who have a total of 120 mg per ure@@ a per day in the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ L .
in comparison to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients receiving Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and no one of 134 patients receiving placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 @-@ 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diarrhea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash , and normal liver abnorm@@ alities .
in particular in patients with heart disease in the history , possibly an increased risk of certain side effects , which affect the heart and blood vessels .
the European Committee for Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) , at the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was lower in lowering blood more than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and the blood vessels could be avoided .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ uri@@ ums and diseases have led to Ur@@ at@@ abl@@ ings ( including one out of the nurse known or currently this Gi@@ cht@@ k@@ not@@ ens and / or a Gi@@ cht@@ arthritis ) .
if the serum intake is still below 6 mg / d@@ L ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mol / l ) , a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg / 1 can be considered a day .
in patients with severe kidney @-@ function testing the efficacy and safety is not fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ean Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .

due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can lead to gra@@ ft emissions or to an increased incidence of side effects , including lower or super@@ immun@@ ity .
patients should always be maintained by the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out using the associated control of one in the transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug application has to be carried out a therapeutic agent monitoring and corresponding dose adjustment to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us stays .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be in first line at clinical assessment of absorption and toler@@ ability in individual cases and to blood vessels ( see below &quot; recommendations
after upgra@@ ding in Adv@@ agra@@ f at Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley levels should be controlled in front of the change@@ over and over two weeks after upgra@@ ding .

careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ tal@@ view mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ f in order to ensure appropriate substance exposure to the immediate transplan@@ tation period .
because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with lower Clear@@ ance , a adjustment of Adv@@ agra@@ f dose Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as may last for several days until the Ste@@ ady State is achieved .

cardiac transplan@@ tation For adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ f is a oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day every day in the morning .
other gra@@ ft receivers had no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ as and cell transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 mg / kg / day and when compared with transplan@@ t levels in a oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dos@@ ing adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function in the target range of patients with severe liver function in patients with severe liver disorders are needed in patients with serious liver disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function , the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
based on the ne@@ phr@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , is a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ en@@ qu@@ at@@ rophy , an calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ inc@@ ance and a monitoring of the ure@@ volume ) .
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ to Adv@@ agra@@ f For the change@@ over of a c@@ ic@@ los@@ us @-@ based therapy is required ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the valley level in full blood . the dose should be based on the clinical assessment of absorption and toler@@ ability in the individual case in response rate of thorou@@ gh@@ bred tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ tal@@ um controls .
it is recommended to frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ view mirror during the first two weeks after Transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ level mirror from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be able to change changes in immun@@ agra@@ f , dos@@ ing , changes of immun@@ ore@@ res@@ sive therapy or with the same application of substances which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us whole blood concentration could be controlled ( see section 4.5 ) .
because Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low degree of clearing , may require adjustments of the dose for several days until the Ste@@ ady State is entered .
the data in clinical trials should be sure that a successful treatment in most cases is possible when the tal@@ view mirror in the blood 20 ng / ml does not exceed .
in clinical practice the valley @-@ level of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us occur in full blood in the first time following liver transplan@@ tations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and low transplan@@ ted patients with 10 @-@ 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance of liver , kidney and cardiac transplan@@ tation , blood concentrations were used in the range of 5 @-@ 15 ng / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft emissions or other side effects , which occur in a row of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or exposure .
patients should always be maintained by the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes to the formulation or the regime should only be carried out by the dedicated control of one in the transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For treatment adult patients with gra@@ ft emissions , who proved to be proved compared with other immun@@ ore@@ res@@ si@@ va as refra@@ ct@@ ory studies , are not yet a clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zing formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the gra@@ vest@@ ment of adult cardiac transplan@@ t and gra@@ ft are not included in the Kin@@ des@@ age , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zing formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
because of possible exchange effects , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ ability can lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us level , the intake of veget@@ al agents ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) , or other plant @-@ absor@@ bers during a treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with Di@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ or@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentrations in the blood were offered , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subjected to such circumstances in such circumstances .
in rare cases , it was identified as a car@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opathy referred to as a car@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , which can therefore be found in Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hypertension , kidney or liver function , infections , liquid load and furn@@ aces .
like with other immun@@ ore@@ res@@ si@@ va the effect of solar light or UV light because of the possible risk of skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a solar control with a high protection factor will be restricted .
if patients , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us take , symptoms of p@@ res such as head@@ aches , changes in consciousness , herbs and visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , should be a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.g. B ) .
because Adv@@ agra@@ f hard cap@@ sul@@ ated , ret@@ ali@@ ons , is included in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary g@@ act@@ less int@@ ents , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency , or glucose sulph@@ ate @-@ absorption .
the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedi@@ es that are known as Hem@@ mer or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , and therefore reduce blood pressure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or reduce the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it is necessary to change the Tac@@ or@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood mirrors in the same range of substances that could change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism , control and the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose for maintaining low concentrations in the amount ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction with an@@ tim@@ y@@ ko@@ tics as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as the Macro@@ flow antibiotic antibiotic ery@@ throm@@ ycin and HIV prot@@ ease Inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies resulted in the increase of blood levels mainly from the increased bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the inhibit@@ ing of the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
highly do@@ si@@ fied pre@@ dnis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ dnis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used in acute absorption reactions , the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can increase in blood or lower .
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibitor ; therefore , the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be determined using CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 metabol@@ ised , which affects metabolism .
because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us reduced the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tives and increase the hormon@@ al exposure , can be careful with decisions about the out@@ stretched measures , especially c@@ auti@@ ous measures .
the results of animal have shown that Tac@@ or@@ lim@@ us potentially reduced the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and Phen@@ az@@ one and extend their sem@@ inal time .
the results of a small number of investigations in transplan@@ t cancer provide no indication that in the process of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ ore@@ res@@ si@@ va , an increased risk for adverse events in terms of the pregnancy and the result of the pregnancy .

Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a lack of factor VIII , alleged blood cl@@ ots ) .
the dosage and incidence of application is afterwards , whether Adv@@ ate for the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures is applied .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suff@@ ers from a factor VIII deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in the joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not made from human plasma , but according to a method produced as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell that has been brought to a gene ( DNA ) into a gene ( DNA ) that allows for the formation of the human barley in VIII .
Adv@@ ate is a different European Union approved in the European Union , called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , however , is different , so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with moderate to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined by the prevention of bleeding and surgery .
in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ate at the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood series has been awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; and &quot; well @-@ evaluated . &quot;
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are dizziness , headache , headache , py@@ rex@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate may not be applied in patients who may not exceed sensitive ( aller@@ genic ) of VIII , mouse or Ham@@ or protein , or one of the other components .
March 2004 , the European Commission has approved the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a approval of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage : dosage and duration of sub@@ stitutes by factor VIII @-@ Man@@ gels , after the place and the extent of the blood and the clinical condition of patients .
in the following case of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma concentration ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection of all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients below 6 years ) are repeat for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until pain and acute inf@@ lows were eliminated .
injection of all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat , until the risk of patients is planned .
during the treatment of treatment , the dose is required to control the required dose and frequency of injection of a factor of VIII @-@ plasma screens .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII , various in vivo Recovery and have differ@@ ing different types .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 meters of body weight of a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII plasma will not be achieved , or if the blood flow is not dominated by an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out if necessary , if necessary .
in patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be wo@@ unding .
the transfer speed is to be found after the assignment of the patients , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutral antibodies ( inhibitors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibitors are always charged with the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of inhibitors can be cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk of risk depends on genetic and other factors depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 positions and an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al @-@ known inhibitor , according to a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product to another , the repeti@@ tion of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibitors .
due to the rare release of the hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , women lie about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
one of the greatest number of patients who treated patients were inhibitors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who have experienced a higher risk to education of inhibitors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 up to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of the available data is not available ) .

previously untreated patients , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) were treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE for patients with A@@ DV@@ ATE .
the immune response in patients on tracks of contamination proteins were analyzed by the study of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed a statistically significant improvement in a statistically significant increase in the antibody against anti @-@ Ch@@ o @-@ cell protein , but otherwise no signs or symptoms occur , which had no sensitivity to an allergic reaction or a sensitivity .

based on the initial approval of the initial approval data , the CH@@ MP has continued to be a positive result , but in principle that the safety profile for the following reasons must be closely monitored :
therefore the CH@@ MP has been based on the basis of the A@@ DV@@ ATE that is needed to apply for 6 months , decided that the author@@ is@@ econ@@ omist in 5 years is supposed to apply a further extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited was officially granted the Committee for Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company receives his application for the treatment of Adv@@ ant@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , the bre@@ asts , the brain , the brain , or the wheat parts ( tissue , the other structures in the body is connected , and is based on it ) .
this is a type of virus that was gene@@ tically modified so that it can bear a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ance is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which was changed so far that it can &apos;t make copies of itself , so that no infections can solve itself in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tumours and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein that is derived from the non def@@ ective in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , is usually used for recovery to be damaged DNA and kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work correctly , and the cancer cells can grow and share .
the company laid data from a study involving a patient who entered the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the sub @-@ building , into the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP grants positive answers to the company on which the question had been checked , there were still some questions un@@ solved .
based on the initial document , the CH@@ MP submitted a list of 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion was not sufficient for the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore advantages to patients .
the committee involved in relation to the processing of medicine in the body , the type of administration and safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not sufficient to show that Adv@@ ant@@ in can be produced in reliable manner , and that it is neither for the environment even for people who come in contact with the patient .
the company set the CH@@ MP to be aware of whether the consequences for patients who currently has become clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &apos; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; altered action @-@ post &quot; means that the tablets are so assembled , that one of the most effective components immediately and the other slowly released a few hours .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is applied to the treatment of symptoms of seasonal cereb@@ ral rh@@ ini@@ tis ( hypo@@ cris@@ y , through an allergy against p@@ ollen in the nose syndrome ) in patients with no@@ zzles ( ring@@ ed nose ) .
in adults and adolescents 12 years old , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a tablet that should be taken every day with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of treatment should be as soon as possible , as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose loop ( hidden nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be re@@ tra@@ ced by the nose .
the basic measurements were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the hypo@@ schn@@ u@@ pf@@ ens@@ y@@ mpt@@ u , who were reported in the start of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients showed their symptoms of 12 hours in a diary in a diary and gave the symptoms in the last 12 hours .
regarding all hypo@@ schn@@ u@@ pf@@ ens@@ y@@ mpt@@ u , the patients who reported aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze revenues , with a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 35@@ ,@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin alone .
if only the swelling of the nose grinding bowls showed a lens in the patient who showed symptoms of 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26,@@ 7 % in patients receiving Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone .
the most common adverse events of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 @-@ 10 of 100 patients ) , phar@@ yn@@ gi@@ tis ( loss of appetite ) , an@@ esth@@ ood , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nie ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( bats ) , sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and nervous tension .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be sensitive to the patients who may be transmitted ( allergy ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin or another in the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ er@@ ous agents or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another medicines for the treatment of allergies ) are not used .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer a bott@@ len@@ ght of hypertension ( hypertension ) , hypertension ( blood pressure ) , or even a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( blood pressure ) , or even a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age ( blood pressure ) or a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic impact .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe to bring an approval of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , to swal@@ lowed in the whole of the whole ( i.e. without them to sm@@ ash each ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used due to the failure of data to un@@ imagin@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) in children under 12 years .
the duration of the application is so short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the duration of 10 days to limit the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin &apos;s activity with the time .
after decline of the swelling of the loop in the upper breath conditions , the treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as a single agent .
because Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indications in patients who treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibitor , respectively , respectively , respectively , respectively , respectively , respectively , respectively , respectively , respectively , respectively , respectively , respectively , respectively .
this is due to the alpha@@ mi@@ me@@ tic activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , per@@ it@@ amin , di@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other Dek@@ on@@ o@@ culo@@ sis ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rin , Oxy@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ ard etc . ) .
security and the efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient correction , and the data is not sufficient to discuss corresponding recommendations to the dosage .
security and the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function , and the data is not sufficient to discuss corresponding recommendations to the dosage .
patients have to be informed that treatment with hypertension ( hypertension ) or of p@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythms , nausea or any other neurological disorders ( such as head@@ aches , or any head@@ aches of the head@@ aches ) must be sold .
the treatment of patient &apos;s treatment is required to be careful in the treatment of patients with heart rhythms • patients with m@@ yo@@ car@@ d@@ infection in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , type of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder , or bron@@ chi@@ osp@@ asmus in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to execution phase testing , the anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions and in their extent can reduce their extent .
however , in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in where ery@@ throm@@ ycin or ket@@ ac@@ on@@ az@@ ole in addition , no clin@@ ically relevant interaction or changes of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was observed .
with the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor tests , no significant differences between the treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and the placebo @-@ treated patients could be taken , regardless of whether distill@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone or with alcohol was taken .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzyme was not identified , so altern@@ ating with other medicines can not be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhibit@@ ing in @-@ vivo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vitro studies show that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit or neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibitor of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the lack of use of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not backed , experience from a large number of pregnancy outcomes , however , did not increase the frequency of abnorm@@ alities compared to the normal population .
as re@@ production studies in animals are not always transferred to humans and on the basis of vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ kt@@ al properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin should not be used in pregnancy .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied in very rare cases , that it can be used in very rare cases , which can lead to a strain on the transport , or ability to serve the ability of machines .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( s@@ atin , Ap@@ no@@ e , decreased spiritual attention , Cy@@ an@@ ose , Kom@@ a , cardiovascular coll@@ age ) and a Z@@ NS stimul@@ ated ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) .

a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly important in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( oral dry , P@@ up@@ ill@@ ar@@ re , and Dil@@ at@@ ation , Hau@@ tr@@ ö@@ zing , Hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include the inhibit@@ ing the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 of human mast cells / bas@@ oph@@ ile , as well as the inhibitor of the expression of the adhesi@@ on of the adhesi@@ ves of the adhesi@@ on of the cells .
when using a single dose study with adults showed , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg does not affect the standard measurement sizes of fluid or the tasks that are connected with the flow .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily , no increased incidence of bats in comparison to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin at the recommended dosage may be more appealing omi@@ me@@ tic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a speed@@ ometer or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S path@@ ogens .
it took place 1.@@ 248 patients at the age between 12 and 78 in seasonal rh@@ ini@@ tis , with 4@@ 14 patients aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amin@@ o@@ gene@@ ist efficacy of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined using the total co@@ res of sympt@@ om@@ atik ( except nose grinding ep@@ tics ) , significantly higher than a mono@@ therapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin for the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the fluctu@@ ate effect , determined using the nose grinding effect , was significantly higher than in a single agent with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was no significant differences in terms of gender , age , or ethnic ethnic group .
as part of a single @-@ dose study to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ within is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the administration .

as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ ing study that was carried out with formulation of healthy adult patients , it was determined that four persons Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was badly damaged .
a components study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin is bio@@ equivalent in the exposure of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin bio@@ equivalent in the exposure of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional medicine for safety har@@ mac@@ eu@@ ology , for toxicity is repeated , the pre@@ valent data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , however , did not recognize any special dangers for human beings .
the combination had no greater toxicity than their individual components , and observed effects in general in connection with the content of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin .

in the per@@ s@@ isti@@ an allergy of rh@@ ini@@ tis ( emergence of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) patients can provide a continuous treatment during the allergy time .
clin@@ ically relevant interaction were not found in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets were given in addition to ery@@ throm@@ ycin or ket@@ ac@@ on@@ az@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , taking care of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol , the effect of alcohol is not reinforced ( see Section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied to be clari@@ fy in very rare cases , that can lead to a impair@@ ment of transport , or the ability to serve the ability of machines .
in clinical trials , including allergic rh@@ ini@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic pul@@ mon@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events in patients with chor@@ us were reported in patients receiving placebo .
the most common adverse events that was reported more common than placebo was fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , dial@@ ects ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 adol@@ es@@ cent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effects of head@@ aches , which were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in patients and treated with placebo in 6.9 % of patients receiving placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , which have been given up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nine different clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the inhibitor of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 of human mast cells / bas@@ oph@@ ile , as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the expression of the adhesi@@ ves of the adhesi@@ on of the RPE cells .
a statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects as part of a clinical study in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in within a dose of up to 20 mg every day was described , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ time of clinical dose ) was given over ten days , showed an extension of Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in a single dos@@ ing study with adults showed the di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg no impact on standard measuring sizes of the flow of up@@ loading and the tasks that are connected with the flow .
in patients with aller@@ gien@@ ic acid , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the lens of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ se@@ wer@@ tion , and mu@@ c@@ tiveness of the nose , itch , lac@@ ri@@ cally flow and rub@@ bing of the eyes as well as itch in the palate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ ini@@ tis can also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ ini@@ tis and per@@ s@@ isti@@ cal weakness Rh@@ ini@@ tis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ ini@@ tis is defined as an occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
per@@ s@@ isti@@ cal allergic rh@@ ini@@ tis is defined as an appearance of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as a result of the total questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the rh@@ ini@@ tis of seasonal rh@@ ini@@ tis , which was produced by seasonal allergic rh@@ ini@@ tis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria has been studied for other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology can be applied to the different forms of forms and chronic patients .
as the history of hist@@ amine faced with all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ ous diseases is predicted that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is also confirmed in other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria in an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies on 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose intervals .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic pul@@ mon@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not agree on anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka re@@ acted from the study .
at 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in treated patients compared with placebo in 55 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of the sleep and the juni@@ per , as determined by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate this variables was measured .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study that was comparable to patients with the general seasonal group of rh@@ ini@@ tis -@@ population , 4 % of patients had a higher concentration of disin@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
there are no stopping points for a clinical relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzyme was not identified , so altern@@ ating with other medicines do not be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhibit@@ ing in @-@ vivo did not show CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies show that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit or neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibitor of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dos@@ ing study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in at a dose of 7.5 mg of meals ( fet@@ us , cal@@ ory consumption , breakfast ) can not be found on the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in carried out clinical studies , at a comparable degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , no qualitative or quantitative differences on demand for Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
based on the conventional medicine for safety har@@ mac@@ eu@@ ology , toxicity is reduced to re@@ productive gen@@ ot@@ an@@ ic@@ ity and to re@@ productive clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in no special dangers for human beings .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. has officially filed an application for the prevention of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 Influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people against the protection against the flu being caused by the tribe of influenza A , H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a trunk that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ de@@ mic breaks out , when a new trunk of the Gri@@ pp@@ e@@ virus occurs , that is easy to spread out of human beings , because people don &apos;t have any immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against the people .
following administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the immune system of the parts of the Gri@@ pp@@ e@@ virus as &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against .
as a result , the immune system later is able to form a contact with a flu virus this family &apos;s fast antibodies .
subsequently , the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membran@@ es , which recognizes the human body as a body @-@ stran@@ ded , is cleaned only ) and used as an integral part of the vaccine .
a inspection of some of the study sites found that the study has not been carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of clinical data base for the evaluation of the vacc@@ ination is not enough to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prehistoric vacc@@ ines .
if you need to participate in a clinical examination and further information on your treatment , please contact your doctor &apos;s doctor .
if you wish to wish further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
in combination with other anti@@ viral medication for the treatment of adults and children over four years , associated with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules not swal@@ low as a solution for entry , but this can not be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination was not studied .
speaking of this , the doctor should be checked , if the doctor has reviewed the anti@@ viral load of patient previously taken , and the probability has judged that the virus is on the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which can be taken together twice daily 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medication .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of fer@@ ase according to body weight .
penetration is reduced by taking in combination with other anti@@ viral medication the HIV amount in blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS is not to he@@ al AIDS , however , the cran@@ ial of the immune system , so that the development of AIDS were related to AIDS and diseases .
acet@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral medication , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , previously treated previously treated prot@@ ease Inhibit@@ ors .
this is reinforced with low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . in 206 adults , which had made earlier Prot@@ ease inhibitor were compared with other prot@@ ease Inhibit@@ ors .
major indi@@ ces for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
in the studies of patients who had no prot@@ ease inhibitor had been taken in 48 weeks under A@@ generic ase more patients receiving viral load under 400 copies / ml as under Placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective as in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children reduced the viral load , however , the viral load , but , however , treated with prot@@ ease inhibitor were treated , only a few to the treatment .
in the study with adults , who had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibitor were treated with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced medicines and viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as well as other prot@@ ease inhibitor :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibitor , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in the viral load of viral load after four weeks of patients receiving their existing prot@@ ease inhibitor .
the most common adverse events of A@@ generic ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , di@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö ( diarrhea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vomiting , rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ pen@@ ase may not be applied in patients who are possibly controlled ( allergic ) against Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r , or one of the other components .
as@@ ci@@ ase may not be used in patients receiving cur@@ vy ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines as well as A@@ generic forms , and in high concentrations in blood health are harmful to health .
as in other medicines for HIV , the risk of recur@@ rent erosion ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis ( ext@@ inc@@ tion of bone tissue ) or an immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( symptoms of infection that causes a relaxing immune system ) .
the European Committee for Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) has concluded that the benefits of chor@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication for treating HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is taken in conjunction with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier k@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of A@@ generic in combination with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who did not have a prot@@ ease inhibitor did not exist .
A@@ generic ase was initially approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; as at the time the approval from scientific reasons only limited information .
October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited for the establishment of A@@ generic ase in the entire European Union .
gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 , prot@@ ease inhibitor ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years .
for usually , A@@ generic capsules for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting of am@@ s@@ avi@@ r is administered together with a low doses of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ lo@@ avi@@ r should be done under consideration of the individual viral load monitoring and treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r is available as a solution for entry is 14 % lower than one capsule . therefore , A@@ generative capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable for one milli@@ grams per milli@@ grams , are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication .
2 If cl@@ amping capsules without the strengthened addition of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) must be applied , higher doses have to be applied ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight is twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication for up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ s@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of min@@ it@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibitor were not studied at children .
A@@ generic ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the failure of data to un@@ imagin@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of chor@@ oidal capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous use of patients with mild or moderate liver function with caution is required , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indications ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ generic ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and sub@@ strate of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ Iso@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations that are included in the risk of cur@@ bs ( hypertension ) , due to the risk @-@ reduced plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r during the taking of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not work with the healing of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of a HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ generic , does not prevent the risk of a transfer of HIV to other through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually , A@@ generic capsules can be used together with low doses of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C suffer and with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , have increased risk of severe liver cells with potentially fatal course .
for the case of an anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the respective information of this medicine .
patients with existing liver function , including chron@@ ically @-@ active hepatitis , showed an increased incidence of liver function using an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is required , it is not recommended that the potential benefit of treatment the risk of system cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the out@@ ni@@ otic function ( see section 4.5 ) .
because the differenti@@ ation of the H@@ MG Co@@ A Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase Hem@@ mer and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International norm@@ ised ratio ) , methods for determination of drug concentration .
in patients who use this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be reduced to lower ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tives may be changed , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interaction .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r , the patient should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ss@@ y@@ mpt@@ u , especially if they are still low doses of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the possible risk of the toxicity of a toxicity is due to a high @-@ risk factor for children under a age of four years , this formulation should be applied in particular with certain other patient groups .
gener@@ ase should be sold to duration 5 , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the s@@ mu@@ te are involved ( see section 4 ) .
in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibitor was reported about the emergence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , Hyper@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia , or an ex@@ az@@ ation of an existing type of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases , their treatment drugs needed to be associated with the development of a type of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia .
B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated with associated metabolic disorders .
in case of hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibitor , reports about an increase of bleeding , including spontaneous hem@@ or@@ ite hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sen .
in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immuno@@ deficiency , the introduction of a anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop a inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ale opportun@@ ist infections that leads to severe clinical trials or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ layer ori@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ ity , higher Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , were reported in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strate can not be given at the same time with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ated the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ Iso@@ ms of 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ sub@@ str@@ ated with low therapeutic beam , can not be used together with pharmaceuticals , whose ingredients are mainly associated with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and for the increased plas@@ mas@@ onry with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ icin caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r , which can result in a vi@@ ro@@ rolo@@ gical failure , and can lead to a resistance development .
at the attempt , the lower plasma concentration through a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibitor in combination with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were often observed very often undes@@ i@@ rable effects on the liver .
Johannis@@ ing ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated publication ) The serum levels of amber can be de@@ emed through the uniform application of herbal preparations with cur@@ vy ( hypertension ) .
if one patient is already cur@@ ated , Am@@ pel@@ avi@@ r@@ mirror , and if possible to check the viral load and cur@@ vy the cur@@ vy .
a dose adjustment for one of the drug is not necessary when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
508 % increase in combination with am@@ s@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ s@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of am@@ s@@ avi@@ r twice daily and k@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the efficacy and in@@ ability of this treatment schem@@ atas .

am@@ s@@ avi@@ r is used twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) , when am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r is administered twice a day ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dos@@ ing recommended for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is not recommended that the effectiveness and un@@ imagin@@ able of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study to use A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the ant@@ acid component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in is recommended that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and ble@@ bs at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
therefore , the offering of E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z is needed in combination with am@@ em@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibitor would be observed .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin on other prot@@ ease inhibitor and existing limited data can be announced that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin was possibly lowers the serum concentration of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r .
if this drug should be used simultaneously , it is necessary to be reduced because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din because of the reduced , possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ mas@@ onry could be effective .
if these drugs can be used together , it is necessary ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be done , since an accurate forecast the effect of the combination of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din .
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ y@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fabulous u@@ tin to 193 % and thus related to an increase in the belt @-@ sensitive side effects .
if it is required for clinical reasons , Ri@@ y@@ u@@ tin is to submit to a reduction of the dose of Ri@@ y@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data are specified .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ throm@@ ycin were not performed , but the plasma concentration of both medicines will be increased in the case of premature administration .
the simultaneous application of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole led to an increase of 25 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole a day to the 2.@@ 69@@ fold in comparison to the value of 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without any simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ y r with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other drugs which are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , Hem@@ mer or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be used when they are applied together with A@@ generic ase may be applied .
patients should therefore be associated with toxic reactions , which are associated with these medicines , if they are applied in combination with A@@ generic ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibitor it is wise that Ant@@ azi@@ da did not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase as it can be taken to res@@ or@@ ption .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va , known as enzymes are known ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ s@@ avi@@ r , can lead to a reduction of the plasma concentration of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r .
the serum concentrations of calcium can@@ al@@ recor@@ ders such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@
the simultaneous taking of A@@ generic forms can significantly increase its plasma concentrations , and with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibitors in combination with side effects , including hyp@@ ot@@ omy , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µ@@ g fluid pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ ch , while the endo@@ genous Kor@@ ti@@ sol was significantly reduced by about 86 % ( 90 % response interval between 82 and 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous offering of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , it is not recommended that the potential benefit of treatment the risk of system cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A re@@ duk@@ es inhibitor , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which depends strongly of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 depending on the intensity of plasma concentration at the same administration of A@@ generic ase .
because plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ant increases of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A re@@ induc@@ t@@ ase shirts to my@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this drug with am@@ s@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
it is recommended for frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabil@@ isation of mirror , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ ycin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with the same gift of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r may be increased ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase cannot be used together with oral mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while the same application is offered by using A@@ generic Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data on the simultaneous application of par@@ abolic mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibitor indicated on a possible increase in the plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3- to 4 @-@ F@@ ache .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r , who should therefore be monitored regularly at O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ss@@ y@@ mpt@@ u , especially if they are administered to low doses of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the use of the same reliability , the amber can be given no Recommen@@ dation , such as the Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is to be given to methane at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on at the same time .
with the same offering of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ulation together with A@@ generic ase , a reinforced control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ised ratio ) is recommended due to the possibility of an in@@ hal@@ ation or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tives is not pre@@ dict@@ able , so alternative methods are recommended to the receivers of the receiver .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ min and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in the same offering of asp@@ ir@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medication should only be applied during pregnancy only after careful removal of the possible utility for the mother compared to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
in the turbul@@ ent rats , Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known to determine whether am@@ s@@ avi@@ r is going to breast milk in breast milk .
a re@@ productive study to re@@ alizing rats that was administered by the ni@@ ece in the uter@@ us by the end of the lac@@ t@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight at the end of the balance .
the further development of the out@@ lining , including fer@@ tility and re@@ production capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r to the mother@@ tier .
the immort@@ ality of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication .
most of the disease @-@ associated side effects were slightly down to moderate , seen early in early and led rarely to treatment .
however , during many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied if they stand in connection with the taking of A@@ generic , or another at the same time for HIV treatment . if they are a consequence of the Gr@@ under@@ disease .
most of the above @-@ effects side effects originate from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ease inhibitor did not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg of recur@@ rent twice daily .

in the study AP@@ V@@ 3000@@ 3 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 3000@@ 5 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ y r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibitor included 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibitor @-@ mutations related to :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ing analysis systems , analyses of the activity of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , or Fos@@ amp@@ y r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are applied for patients with prot@@ ease inhibitor @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm is defined as the presence of mutations of the mutations and at least 4 of the following Mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I / M / M / S / V / s , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 2A and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with an increased resistance to Fos@@ amp@@ y r with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of a vi@@ gil@@ ded response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding flow of certain mutations or nuts are subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to tackle the current interpret@@ ations for analysis of the results of resistance tests .
based analysis based on phenomen@@ al resistance testing , based in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ical data to estimate the activity of am@@ s@@ avi@@ r / Knight on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibitor @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute the diagnostic resistance tests , clin@@ ically clin@@ ici@@ an Cut @-@ offs ( partition points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to the interpretation of a resistance tests .
each of these four comes with a reduced sensitivity of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r @-@ associated genetic patterns produced a certain resist@@ ence against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity of In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r , however , remains in general .
there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistant between Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease Inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ y Resist@@ ers , either alone or in combination with other mutations .
based on the five @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral load ( three of 25 Isol@@ ate ) , Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
vice vers@@ a , Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r keeps the activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibitor @-@ resistant Isol@@ ate ; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isol@@ ates .
early release of a vers@@ ing therapy is recommended to keep the vulner@@ ability of a variety of mutations in the borders , which can take effect on the following treatment .
based on the PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a randomized open study based on the PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a randomized open study ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nu@@ cli@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard of care ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ seven ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ generic , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in terms of viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ reduction target threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ t@@ oo@@ ster@@ ly A@@ generic ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice a day , while the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
it was not a low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ; the majority of those treated with PI treated patients had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) together with A@@ generic ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients were included in the study . patients with HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentrations of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml at a median increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Basi@@ l on this data should be considered in the treatment optim@@ isation with PI pre @-@ treated children of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inf@@ oo@@ ster@@ ling &quot; A@@ generic &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the mean duration ( T@@ max ) to maximum serum concentration of Am@@ éri@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
a number of 508 are increased by 30 % for C@@ max ( 100 mg twice daily ) , together with am@@ s@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , together with am@@ s@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pel@@ vic with a meal leads to a 25 % decline in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
thus , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the dietary intake of the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is about 430 liters ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) , as well as a non @-@ suspended Pen@@ et@@ ration of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r from the blood circuit in the tissue .
this amend@@ ment leads to a decrease in the concentration of drug in plasma , with the amount of un@@ solved Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r , which remains the active share , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ coated am@@ s@@ avi@@ r is constant , fluctu@@ ated the percentage of free active ingredient in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State on the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induced or inhi@@ bits a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with particular caution if they are given at the same time using A@@ generic ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the treatment of A@@ generic capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ s@@ avi@@ r exposure like adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bi@@ ore@@ able as from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase is not usable on a milli@@ metre base .
also , the renal Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the impact of an kidney function to the elimination of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r plasma samples , which are comparable to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ s@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

the 21 underlying horizontal mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ at@@ cellular Aden@@ ome and Kar@@ zin@@ ome was not clari@@ fied and relevance of this observed effects of people is un@@ clear .
based on the present data from all clinical trials , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , however , however , has little notes for acceptance of a clinical relevance of this findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ oxi@@ fication tests , the bacter@@ ici@@ test on rats and chromosome aber@@ ration test on human peripheral lympho@@ cytes were Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen still gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver to@@ xi@@ ity can be monitored in clinical life through the measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of the alkal@@ ine phosphor@@ ites .
so far , in clinical trials , there was no significant liver cells in patients , either during the administration of A@@ generic , nor after the end of treatment .
studies on the toxicity of young people who had been treated with an age of 4 days , both with the control and also in the am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r @-@ treated animals showed a high mortality .
in a systematic plasma exposure , significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dose to humans were observed , however , a number of minor changes including th@@ ym@@ us@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and small skel@@ eton changes were observed that point on a delayed development .
24 When A@@ generative capsules without the strengthened addition of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) must be applied , higher doses have to be applied ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight is twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication for up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ s@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use of patients with weak or lighter liver function with caution is required , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indications ( see section 4.3 ) .

an increased risk of li@@ po@@ dyst@@ rophi@@ es was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , and associated with associated metabolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ icin caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r , which can result in a vi@@ ro@@ rolo@@ gical failure , and can lead to a resistance development .

am@@ s@@ avi@@ r is used twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) , when am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r is administered twice a day ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dos@@ ing recommended for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is not recommended that the effectiveness and un@@ imagin@@ able of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibitor would be observed .
if these drugs can be used together , it is necessary ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be done , since an accurate forecast the effect of the combination of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din .
if it is required for clinical reasons , Ri@@ y@@ u@@ tin is to submit to a reduction of the dose of Ri@@ y@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data are specified .

with the same offering of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ulation together with A@@ generic ase , a reinforced control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ised ratio ) is recommended due to the possibility of an in@@ hal@@ ation or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ thin@@ di@@ ol ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r to 22 % of it .

in case of an over@@ dose is the patient on signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , the support measures are required .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ s@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined in both ak@@ ut and chronic lympho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lympho@@ cytes .
the 50 % inhibitor of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0,0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
vice vers@@ a , Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r keeps the activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibitor @-@ resistant Isol@@ ate ; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the treatment optim@@ isation should be considered with the PI pre @-@ treated children of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ling &quot; A@@ generic ase in concrete .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ coated am@@ s@@ avi@@ r is constant , fluctu@@ ated the percentage of free active components in dependence on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State on the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .

safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a randomized , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study to 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recruited for the study , which had been investigating the entire disease of disease , the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited if they had a forward exp@@ iratory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to go to 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of rising FE@@ V and the absolute sal@@ inity in 6 @-@ Min@@ ut@@ ure .
all patients were recruited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they were for another 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me received .
after 26 weeks of therapy with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me treated patients compared to the placebo group an improvement in the lung function and the ability to appear in the following table .
in the open @-@ extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining the effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group .
the decrease in the percentage of percentage @-@ percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significantly and the absolute lung volume increased further to the body size of growing children .
from 26 patients with a hep@@ at@@ om@@ eg@@ aly there was 22 ( 85 % ) up to the end of the study a normal liver size .
in the first 4 weeks , a clear tr@@ ash of G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ inin ) has been established , which remained constant until the academic year .
regarding the hetero@@ genous illness of the patient , which was clin@@ ically isolated from a combined end@@ point of patients ( excluding Tamiflu and visual acuity ) , there was a significant improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ old Phase 2 study conducted primarily to safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me at 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with heavy tra@@ iling form and 4 with the middle tra@@ iling form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) and every 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up showed only limited or even no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study studies , investigations into pharmac@@ ologically dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schem@@ ata based on the G@@ AG mirror in the har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute chassis were performed .

A@@ lim@@ ta is previously treated in patients who were previously treated with c@@ is@@ platin and in patients who previously received other anth@@ ra@@ cycline @-@ therapy .
to reduce side effects , patients suffering from A@@ lim@@ ta should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and receive vitamin B12 and vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ platin , a &quot; anti@@ eme@@ dia &quot; ( Medic@@ ines against vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent a fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood image can be changed or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be pushed , or the dose will be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed is making the formation of DNA and RNA , and prevents the cells divide the cells .
the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed into its active form is lighter than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of drug with a longer term of drug in cancer cells .
in a major study for the treatment of malign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ ome , A@@ lim@@ ta was investigated in a major study on 456 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for any condition .
in treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were treated with a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which previously treated with doc@@ etaxel ( any other medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( a further medicines for cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ platin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and c@@ is@@ platin lived in an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9,3 months in a few administration of c@@ is@@ platin .
in patients who received previously received chemotherapy had already received an average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared with 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ etaxel .
however , in both studies , patients with whom the cancer is not the predomin@@ ant squ@@ amous cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta in survival compared to the comparative medicine .

each flow bottle have to be fitted with 4,2 ml 0,9 % sodium chloride @-@ injection ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ ctors is taken from the flow bottle and is dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chloride @-@ injection ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ platin displayed in the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcinoma ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mono@@ therapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcinoma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ platin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after finishing the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcinoma , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² CO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to the reduction of frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions have to be given on the day before and on the day the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed gift , and on the day after the treatment of a cor@@ ti@@ ko@@ ster@@ oid .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed must be taken at least 5 cans of fo@@ lic acid and the intake must be res@@ um@@ ed during the entire period , as well as for further 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need a intra@@ mus@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed dose , as well as after each third charge cycle .
in patients who received P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed , one should produce a complete blood image , including a differenti@@ ation of leu@@ ko@@ cyte and a throm@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ sion@@ ary .
this alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ates ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose of dose must be held , taking the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood balance or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity of the previous treatment cycles .
after the recovery , the patients have to be treated according to the tables in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a single agent or in combination with c@@ is@@ platin .
these criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) of C@@ TC degree 2 blood .
if patients are non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity of 3 times ( excluding ne@@ ot@@ oxi@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA , until the patient had the value before the treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA has to be broken if in patients after 2 dose of hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity 3 or 4 , or so@@ ak at the appearance of Grade 3 or 4 ne@@ ot@@ oxi@@ ity .
clinical trials had no indication that in patients aged 65 . in the age of 65 years , or in comparison to patients aged 65 years , an increased response risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data to un@@ imagin@@ able and effectiveness .
in clinical trials , patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ fusion of ≥ 45 ml / min no dose adjusting for patients who are recommended for all patients recommended Dos@@ age adjustments .
data conditions in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ fusion of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with liver function limitation of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ time frame rate and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ times of the upper limit of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.@@ 0 times the upper limit value ( where presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not especially studied in the studies .
patients have to be monitored with regard to the bone transplan@@ tation and P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ally , had a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the throm@@ bo@@ - cy@@ ten@@ ment has a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neutr@@ alisation , throm@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ds and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ orial toxicity as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a smaller toxicity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ chth@@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity like neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia was reduced when a treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 .
therefore all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed patients are to be examined , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as pro@@ phy@@ - lak@@ tic measure to reduce toxicity of toxicity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium renal in@@ suffici@@ ency ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) must be used for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and surgery ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who use a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ et , taking the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients , where these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events , including expansion of high blood pressure , or diabetes .
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically reported fluid - collection of trans@@ mitting space in trans@@ cellular space is a drainage system in front of the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed treatment .
5 Schwer@@ in cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ d@@ inf@@ ants , and broken events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed occasionally , if this active ingredient is generally used in combination with a different cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application @-@ defined atten@@ dees is affected ( excluding yellow fever , these vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indications ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of an irre@@ versi@@ bly sk@@ ates of the re@@ productive wind through P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed , men should be noted in front of the treatment - to get to the sper@@ ma@@ ins service .
in patients with normal renal function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ lic acid ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) can lead to a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed separation with the result of an increase of adverse events .
therefore it is necessary to be used when patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ lic acid can be used in high dosage .

there is no data regarding inter@@ ac@@ tion@@ less than with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application of P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed must be avoided for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re x@@ ed .
the big in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the Ger@@ inn@@ umer@@ ation status while the disease and the possibility of interaction between oral anti@@ coag@@ ulation and ant@@ ine@@ op@@ l@@ astic chemotherapy requires an increased frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ised ratio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient suffering from oral anti@@ coag@@ ulation .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed in Schw@@ ang@@ es , but as with an@@ de@@ - an@@ tim@@ etab@@ oli@@ ites are expected in pregnancy heavy birth defects .
P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed can not be applied during pregnancy , except for a challenging and after careful removal of the utility for the mother and the risk of fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of an irre@@ versi@@ fication of the re@@ productive path@@ ogens was prescribed by P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed , men should be noted prior to the start of treatment , advice on the sper@@ ma@@ ins service .

alo@@ xi is applied to chemo@@ therapies for nausea and vomiting ( such as c@@ is@@ platin ) , as well as chemo@@ therapies for nausea and vomiting ( such as cyclo@@ phosp@@ ha@@ mide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ icin or Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi may be increased by the additional treatment of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine which can be used as anti@@ eme@@ dia ) .
the application in patients under 18 years is not recommended because of the effects in this age group are not enough information .
this means that the substance used in the case of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as Ser@@ ot@@ onin ) , to the receptors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three major studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults , who received chemotherapy regim@@ ens , which are strong or even coverage for nausea and vomiting .
chemo@@ therapies for nausea and vomiting are 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi patients who received no vomiting ( 132 of 223 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron treated patients ( 126 from 221 ) .
chemo@@ therapies for nausea and vomiting showed that 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi during the 24 hours after chemotherapy had no vomiting ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
March 2005 , the European Commission on Helsinki &apos;s Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. held a approval of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is Indian : for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting at heavily em@@ itted chemotherapy due to an advanced HER2 @-@ positive cancer and vomiting for the prevention of nausea and vomiting at moderate chemotherapy due to an advanced cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a heavily em@@ itted chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding one of the chemotherapy given by adding one prior to chemotherapy .
as Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can be extended to patients with an@@ am@@ nesty ob@@ struction and signs of an sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after the injection of the injection .
however , like with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antag@@ onists , however , is required to extend the application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or up to such an extension .
except in connection with a further chemotherapy treatment , Alo@@ xi was not used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy .
in clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron inhi@@ bits the activity of the five examined chemotherapy chemotherapy ( Cis@@ platin , cyclo@@ phosp@@ ha@@ mide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ icin and Mit@@ om@@ ycin C ) .
in a clinical study , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic effect between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ eless Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibitor .
in a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis , an@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ icin , fluor@@ o@@ e@@ tin , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ine , do@@ mic@@ e@@ tin , k@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , k@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , k@@ tr@@ al@@ ine , k@@ tr@@ al@@ ine , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ ine and ter@@ ob@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences on the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not used , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women , unless there is necessary to be used as a necessary doctor .
in clinical trials , the most commonly used in a dose of 250 micro@@ gram ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which may be at least with Alo@@ xi in connection with head@@ aches , headache ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ servatory &apos;s ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration ( distill@@ ation , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were given in post @-@ market share reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar results of adverse events such as in the other dos@@ ing groups , there were no dose of drug relationships .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is believed to be effective in a alo@@ xi@@ fication therapy .
in two randomized double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosp@@ ha@@ mide ( half hours ) or 750 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ set@@ ron ( half @-@ time ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( semi@@ wer@@ time 7.@@ 3 hours ) received intraven@@ ously to day 1 without exam@@ in@@ eth@@ ason intraven@@ ously .
a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a total of 6@@ 67 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosp@@ ha@@ mide and 250 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron patients who received 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron received a total of 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with greatly em@@ itted chemotherapy are condens@@ ed into the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were similar to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ T@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of the clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation List I@@ on channels and extend the duration of the promotional potential .
the survey conducted by 221 healthy volunteers were the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. 0,@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous treatment follows an initi@@ ating decrease in the body with an average termin@@ ale elimination of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the curve @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally propor@@ tioned in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 / g / kg and cancer patients and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous treatment of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average average ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that the equivalent of 0.@@ 75 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received a total number of intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max was measured after the l@@ ashing of 0.@@ 75 mg higher .
about 40 % are eliminated by ki@@ d@@ neys and approximately more 50 % are converted into two primary metabolism , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , less than 1 % of the receptor @-@ inhibit@@ ing effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies for met@@ al@@ ising , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of pall@@ ets , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 .
elimination of a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams per kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were re@@ found in the urine originating from 144 hours of urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , as an un@@ altered substance , made about 40 % of the given dose .
according to a unique intraven@@ ous Bol@@ ts , the total body composition is 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function , the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ wer@@ der and the average systemic exposure of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions , which are considered sufficient on the maximum flow exposure to clinical use as sufficient for clinical use .
10 From pre @-@ clinical studies resulted in evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels , which can be extend to vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose was found in approximately 30 times the therapeutic exposure of liver cells , endo@@ cr@@ ine op@@ rene ( in thy@@ roid , hyp@@ ophy@@ sis , p@@ ank@@ re@@ as , ou@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin treatments at rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and because Alo@@ xi is intended for the one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is low as for people .
the approval of this authori@@ zation for the inst@@ ant@@ ment must bring the European Commission concerning the plans for the promotion of the implementation of the medicine in the context of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) submitted a negative opinion , in which the approval of the treatment for the treatment of hepatitis C and Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution was recommended .
this means that Alph@@ eon is a biological medicine called Ro@@ feron @-@ A with the same office as an effective part , which is already approved in the EU ( also &quot; reference advice &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long sustained ) of hepatitis C ( one of the liver disease ) .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic examination , the liver tissue damage indicates that these values are increased by the liver enzymes in the Al@@ an@@ tic Amin@@ o s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast which has been incorporated into a gene ( DNA ) that leads to the formation of the drug .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon specified data on the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ feron @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug by means of effect , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference practices to 4@@ 55 patients .
in the study , as many patients received 12 of 48 treatment courses and 6 months after setting the treatment to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .

in addition , not to be aware that the data to stability of the drug @-@ drug and marketing of the drug is not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , who responded to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ feron @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon Fire on the disease in more patients again than with the reference practices , Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
in addition to this study , the test was conducted in the study conducted an investigation into the study that forms a immune response ( i.e. the body forms the antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficient .
it can be applied for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with a cru@@ ising skin disease ) and small in@@ infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ or and sections ) , amor@@ tis@@ ation and se@@ wn W@@ ear .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections , which have been ext@@ ingu@@ ished or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go could not work against this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients with the age of nine months , but in patients receiving 18 years of skin , non @-@ treat skin surface are not more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient did not respond to the treatment after two to three days , the doctor should follow the patients and imp@@ lications alternative treatments .

major indication of the efficacy was approved in all five studies of the patients whose infection after the end of treatment was executed .
119 patients ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients responded to placebo .
in the treatment of in@@ infected skin , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response rates : if the results of both studies were collected at skin courses , about 90 % of the patients had both groups on the treatment .
however , in these two studies it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go has been carried out in the treatment of Ab@@ sz@@ eat ( filled cavity in the body tissue ) or infections which have been demon@@ stra@@ bly or presumably by MR@@ SA , not effective enough .
the most common side effects of Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 @-@ 10 of 100 patients ) is a friction on the site .
the European Committee for Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) has concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go led to the risks resulting in the patient &apos;s surface treatment : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • adjuvant small Laz@@ er@@ ations , wiring or se@@ ams .
may 2007 , the European Commission has approved the Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . , a approval of Al@@ tar@@ go into the entire European Union .
patients who doesn &apos;t work within two to three days , should even be examined and an alternative therapy must be carried out ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of a sensitivity or serious local Ir@@ rit@@ ation by the use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is broken down , and an appropriate alternative therapy to the infection should be started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be applied for the treatment of infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials , the efficacy of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant p@@ yl@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) caused un@@ sufficient .
an alternative therapy is supposed to be considered , if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment , no recovery or deteri@@ oration of the infected people occurs .
the impact of the simultaneous application of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical measures at the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations , which have been achieved in humans after top@@ ical application of the skin , or in@@ infected super@@ fici@@ ally , a clinical @-@ relevant in@@ hibition of vivo did not expect in vivo ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous administration of 2 times daily , the medium Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max also increased to top@@ ical application of 1 % retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ine to abol@@ ished skin from healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low @-@ systemic exposure of patients with c@@ is@@ adjustments are not required for patients if top@@ ical retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was applied during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibitors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive toxicity after oral intake and inadequate relation to the effects of the birth and the fö@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear and the use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was to prevent the treatment of an systematic antibiotic treatment .
with the decision to res@@ um@@ ed the breast@@ feeding or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continued / finished , it is between the use of the lac@@ t@@ gling for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was used , the most frequently reported response in the administration of the administration , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .

the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction between the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om of the bacter@@ ici@@ ans of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om , which differs from the bin@@ ders of other ri@@ bos@@ ses .
data indicate that the rate of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P Bin@@ issal@@ em and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase centre is .
by binding on this bin@@ ation site pro@@ mul@@ mu@@ ti@@ line , pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ed pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ ate , block partial heart rate detection and prevent the normal formation of active non @-@ ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler units .
if , on the basis of the local pre@@ valence of resistance pre@@ valence the application of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infectious forms , should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , ir@@ respective of whether the isol@@ ates are sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case a non @-@ response to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us should be considered the presence of strains with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) .
res@@ or@@ ption in a study with healthy adults was 1 % retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ine per day under Ok@@ klu@@ sion on intact and extra@@ cting skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ine twice daily for 5 days in top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ mati@@ tis , individual plasma samples were gained .

ambi@@ rix are used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( disease which affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not used against these two diseases .
ambient light is applied during one of two doses of existing vacc@@ ines , whereby a protection against hepatitis B might be reached only after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , ambi@@ tions can only be used , if the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is made sure that the order can be led to the end of two doses of the vacc@@ ines .
if a differenti@@ ation dose against hepatitis A or B is desired , ambient light or another hepatitis B or B vacc@@ ines can be given .
vacc@@ ines work , adding them to the immune system ( the natural body of the body ) , &quot; as it can apply against a disease .
after a child received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the immune system and the surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign d &quot; and creates antibodies .
ambient rix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twin@@ rix , and since 1997 approved vaccine has been approved by the Twin@@ rix vaccine since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are applied to the protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix are given at one out of three doses of existing vacc@@ ines .
because ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix are identical ingredients , some of the data that uses the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as a ventilation for the use of ambient rix .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the efficacy was the proportion of g@@ ger@@ ed children who had developed a protective antibodies after the last injection of the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six months and a 12 @-@ month intervals between the two injection .
ambient light between 98 and 100 % of the g@@ ger@@ ed children received a month after the last inj@@ ectors to the development of a concentration of antibodies against Hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of ambient light are similar at a 6 @-@ month intervals between the injection and a 12 @-@ month distance .
the most common adverse events of ambient light ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are head@@ aches , loss of appetite , pain in injection , tubes , mat@@ ness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
ambient rix in patients who are possibly excessive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ ycin ( an antibiotic ) , not to be applied .
August 2002 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ zed s.@@ a. a permit for the inst@@ ances of ambient light in the whole
the standardi@@ zation plan for Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ zation with ambient rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , with the first dose of the choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ine vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ine vacc@@ ines or vacc@@ inated with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ Hepatitis B surface antigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are equal to the same size as according to the vacc@@ ination with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not fully backed whether an immun@@ ological people who need to be vacc@@ inated on a Hepatitis A of Hepatitis C , which may also be protected by the immun@@ ological memory for no more det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 How in all injection components should be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the offering of the vacc@@ ination , for medical treatment and monitoring , always available immediately .
if a faster protection against hepatitis B is required , the standar@@ dised test , the 360 ELISA units are form@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
with hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis treatment and people with dis@@ ruption of the immune system , an investigational anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody is achieved , so in these cases the offering of additional vacc@@ ines can be required .
because a intra@@ der@@ mal inj@@ ector or intra@@ mus@@ cular administration may lead to a sub@@ optimum Imp@@ act failure , these injection should be avoided .
with throm@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ots disorders can be inj@@ ected ; however , as an in@@ cut@@ aneous injection can be inj@@ ected , as it can occur in these cases after intra@@ mus@@ cular treatment .
when am@@ bition is a separate injection , in the form of a separate injections ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ - Mum@@ ps vacc@@ ines , the immune response was given to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients under immun@@ ore@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immuno@@ defects , it may be achieved that no longer immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study that leads with 3 vacc@@ ination of this formulation in adults , was the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , swelling , mat@@ ures , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever comparable to the disease which was observed in earlier Thi@@ omer@@ ang and preserv@@ ative vacc@@ ines .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses were given at 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years the toler@@ ability of ambi@@ tions were compared with the 3 @-@ doses of the 3 @-@ cans .
only exceptions were the higher skins of pain and mat@@ ures on an calculation base per vacc@@ ines ambi@@ rix , but not on an calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the treatment of ambient rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects were observed , compared to 3@@ 9.1 % for the treatment of a dose of 3 @-@ cans .
according to the complete vaccine cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the persons who had given am@@ bition to the ambient conditions , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in subjects who were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the incidence of mud was similar to similar ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who were am@@ u@@ rix compared with 3@@ 6,@@ 2 % for subjects who received the 3 cans ( doses ) .
the frequency supple@@ mented pain and mat@@ ures was low and comparable to the administration of the combination of a combination of the 3 @-@ cans vaccine was observed .
in a comparative study of 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambi@@ tions are comparable with 360 ELISA units form@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
however , during the 6- to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with ambient light , there was a sac@@ ral occurrence of pain ( at the injection of the injection ) per dose , not per pro@@ band .
the percentage of vacc@@ ines , which have severe adverse events during the 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination with a combination of the 360 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface , was statistically significant .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral food and beverage , but can also be transferred by other ways , such as by Baden in the waters of the waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a bl@@ unt face , yellow skin , and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms , which may need a stationary treatment .
like with all vacc@@ ines , ambi@@ tions are not fully protect before an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series was completed with 2 cans .
if you have been infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus ( though you have been infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus ( though you don &apos;t have any case for the vacc@@ ination time not yet or ill / feel ) a vacc@@ ination may not be avoided .
a protection against other infections that cause the liver or symptoms , which are similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection .

an allergic reaction can occur through ju@@ ck@@ les skin lesi@@ ons , short@@ ness of breath or death cases . • If you have a allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against Hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you have a heavy infection with fever / has .
if you want to use a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the appropriate administration of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
in a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will take you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with ambient rix .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 injection of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vacc@@ ination with a reduced salary of hepatitis B virus ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vacc@@ ination with reduced content of effective components is usually administered a month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ination in the vacc@@ ination of the vacc@@ ination series .

but it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for the vacc@@ ination and the person should not be protected against one or both hepatitis B and B viruses .
if another vaccine will be given at the same time with ambient rix , should be vacc@@ inated on separate places and as possible in various limbs .
if ambient rix on the same time or shortly before or after an injection of Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ b@@ ines , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually ambient temperatures will not be administered by ambi@@ tions or breast@@ feeding women , except it is necessary to vacc@@ inated both against Hepatitis A and hepatitis B and hepatitis B .
important information on certain other components of ambient , Please inform your doctor if you have an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ ycin ( antibiotic ) .

ambient rix is available in pack@@ ungen 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in pack@@ ungen too 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of data , which became known since the opening of the first permission , the CH@@ MP has made the view that the benefit @-@ risk proportion of ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , only in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient .
on the age of more than a month , Amm@@ on@@ isation can also be found in the history of more than a month with in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ ous en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ium concentrations ) in the history of history .
Amm@@ on@@ aps is split by several individual doses of meals - split by the food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ sto@@ mi@@ tic ( by the stomach from the stomach ) or a nose probe ( by the nose in the stomach of the hose ) .
this was not a comparative study , because Amm@@ on@@ aps did not occur with another treatment or placebo ( a patient &apos;s treatment , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
the Amm@@ on@@ aps can also cause loss of loss in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ aches , irrit@@ ability , fla@@ vor@@ ing or flavour @-@ outs , abdominal pain , nausea , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , rash , un@@ pleasant body odor@@ ch or weight increase .
for Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) , the European Committee for Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) has concluded that Amm@@ on@@ aps in patients with dis@@ ruption of the ure@@ ous cycle of ammon@@ ium values are effective .
Amm@@ on@@ aps was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , because because of the wor@@ sen@@ ess of the disease , only limited information on this drug was not limited .
the use of all patients is indic@@ ative in which a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ deficiency is already manifest@@ ed in new@@ bor@@ age ( within the first 28 Leb@@ age ) .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fixed form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ ous defect ) , an indication of the use for use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , there is a hyper@@ Amm@@ on@@ ese en@@ cephal@@ opathy .
for babies who are not able to swal@@ low for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with can@@ ck@@ disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually adapted under consideration of the protein toler@@ ance and the development of the daily protein intake of patients .
after previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ ylene : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg , as well as in @-@ growing and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate yn@@ th@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ c@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine is needed in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ ats@@ yn@@ th@@ ase deficiency must be ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 / 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with ra@@ ck@@ disorders , because there are no risk of risk for the emergence of oil t@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , if the tablets were not able to reach the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium chloride , which equ@@ ates the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ spic@@ uous heart failure , or severe renal in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium re@@ tention and liver abnorm@@ alities only with caution .
as met@@ al@@ ising and removal of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ ylene above the liver and the ki@@ d@@ neys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used for patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS while the pregnancy is contra@@ indications ( see 4.3 ) .
when sub@@ cut@@ aneous treatment of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high dose ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal formations and increased to an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed friction coefficient of zer@@ eb@@ r@@ als syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of work neur@@ ons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be found that Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is taken into the breast milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ sted in terms of contra@@ indications ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at 56 % of patients receiving at least an adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events was assumed that they did not deal with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS in conjunction with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old em@@ angi@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tic acid , severe hypo@@ kal@@ an@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neurop@@ athy and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atitis .
one case of an over@@ dose stood with an acci@@ dental dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dos@@ ing limit of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic compound which is characterized by acet@@ yl@@ zing with glut@@ amine to Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which will be marked by the kidney .
fra@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds include 2 nitrogen oxide ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is suitable as an alternative carriers for the separation of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ ruption of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram of bias of sodium chloride , between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 grams of Phen@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important to improve the diagnosis and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival and clinical results .
the prog@@ nosis of the early symptoms in the new@@ bor@@ age was almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease led itself on the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ cs @-@ free Analo@@ ga within the first years of life .
by h@@ emo@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide ( sodium chloride ) , protein reduced K@@ ost and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids was possible to increase the survival rate in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life month ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy and the disease was diagnosed in the pregnancy of a hyper@@ op@@ ha@@ emor@@ rh@@ age group , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with many to mental disabilities or other neurological issues .
in patients with a late @-@ fixed form of the disease ( including female patients with a hetero@@ gene@@ tic form of or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ boo @-@ man@@ gels ) , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ ylene and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate of 98 % .
already existing neurological deficit are also hardly recur@@ rent in treatment and in some patients can occur further deteri@@ oration of the neurological issues .
it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ ylene can oxi@@ di@@ ate to Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is produced in liver and kidney , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ ylene in plasma and urine were determined after the treatment of a single dose of 5 grams of sodium chloride and patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis for single delivery as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabolism was also studied for cancer patients after intraven@@ ous treatment of sodium chloride ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a oral dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ ylene in tablet form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ ur@@ able plasma concentration of Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cycli@@ cal mal@@ nutrition ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day , up to 20 g / day ) on the next morning after the dry fast@@ eners .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeated with sodium chloride ( 20 g / day oral into three single boxes ) , the medium @-@ phen@@ yl acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma concentration on the third day five times higher than after the first forks .
removal of this medication is made within 24 hours of approximately 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ gated product poly@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine for the ki@@ d@@ neys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ pp@@ us tests with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses of rats no kla@@ sto@@ genic effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral dos@@ ing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ul@@ at is taken either by oral ( inf@@ ants and children that cannot swal@@ low no tablets , or patients with ra@@ ck@@ disorders ) or over a Gast@@ ro@@ sto@@ mi@@ el or a Nas@@ al probe .
after previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium chloride and children weighing less than 20 kg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg , as well as in @-@ growing and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins should be held within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate yn@@ th@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ c@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine is needed in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .

angi@@ ox is applied to treat patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) for instance at an un@@ stable Ang@@ ina ( with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ kar@@ d@@ infection market ( heart failure ) without &quot; St@@ reng@@ th@@ ening &quot; ( an abnorm@@ ality value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogra@@ m or E@@ KG ) .
angi@@ ox for preventing blood cl@@ ots are applied in patients who use a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be res@@ um@@ ed up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with Ang@@ ina or heart failure to maintaining the blood flow into the heart and the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS for a few treatment or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibitor ( G@@ PI , a different medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with he@@ avier treatment ( another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI compared to the treatment .
while the PCI was often suffering a st@@ ent ( a short Rö@@ hr@@ chen , which remains in the arter@@ ies , and they also received other drugs to preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ ximab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was angi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI , with closure of new events ( deaths , cardiac abnorm@@ alities or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days and a year as conventional treatment .
in patients who underwent a PCI system , angi@@ ox in relation to all indicators are as effective as le@@ par@@ in , except for heavy blood vessels , in which it was more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox must not be applied in patients who may have no sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other Hir@@ u@@ dine or one of the other components .
it may not be used in patients who had a blood pressure , as well as people with strong blood pressure or serious kidney problems , or a heart rate .
the European Committee for Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) has reached the conclusion that angi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is an removable replacement for He@@ par@@ in .
September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd , a approval of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / Non @-@ ST @-@ lever ) ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) , if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended dose dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ ages of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is done in a PCI @-@ kg treatment , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and in@@ fusion for the duration of the input to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be absorbed for 4 to 12 hours .
a dose of 0.5 mg / kg was administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h with a in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI @-@ dose rate of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight is a weight of each associated with intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
safety and efficacy of a few Bol@@ us treatment of angi@@ ox was not studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) was reduced to below 225 seconds , should be a second round of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT , the re@@ productive and dil@@ uted out in front of the use is carefully connected and the Bol@@ us@@ ef@@ ly administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value amounts to more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is not necessary , provided 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of in@@ fusion dose .
patients with moderate kidney @-@ function test ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are exposed to a PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine or not ) , should be used in a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h .
the ACT @-@ value is below 225 seconds , is a second Bol@@ us@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg depending on the second Bol@@ us@@ s@@ dose .
in patients with moderate renal cell in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which led to the approval , was included only 5 minutes to the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment for an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .

patients have been carefully monitor during treatment in terms of symptoms and indications of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine are given in combination with another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ans ( see section 4.5 ) .
although in PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , most blood vessels occur in arter@@ ial points , can occur in patients who occur in a Peru@@ vian correlation ( PCI ) while treatment in principle anywhere else .
patients who use War@@ far@@ in and with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine should be drawn to a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International norm@@ ised ratio ) to ensure that the value of treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine come again in front of the treatment level .
based on the knowledge of the anti @-@ action mechanism of anti@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ un ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or throm@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ds ) can be assumed that this active ingredients increase the blood circulation .

A@@ pi@@ dra is applied for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years of diabetes , who need treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is administered sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) in the abdominal wall , or the upper arm or the upper arm or in@@ fusion with a insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease which is not sufficient for the body of the body of glucose ( sugar ) in the blood , or that insulin can not be effective .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs a very little of human beings , and the change means that it works qui@@ cker and a shorter drug @-@ duration has been regarded as a short @-@ effective Human@@ ity .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long effective insulin delivery of patients with type 1 Diabetes , in which the body can not produce in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in case of type 2 diabetes in which the body can not be effective in the body , A@@ pi@@ dra was investigated in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the major indication for the efficacy was the change of concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ elled h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in blood as well as the blood sugar .
in the first study with adults with type 1 Diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % for insulin is determined .
in adults with type 2 diabetes a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration amounted to 0,@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0,@@ 30 % .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who are not sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other ingredients , or in patients who suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted to be adjusted when it is given together with a number of other medicines that can work on the blood glucose levels .
September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Germany GmbH for the establishment of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous waste by continuous in@@ fusion in the areas of abdominal belt .
due to the reduced glucose sy@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced insulin @-@ activation , the insulin needs can be lowered to patients with a limitation of the liver function .
any change of the drug force , the brand ( Her@@ o er ) , insulin pump ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc plated , etc . ) , the species of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or of the method can be changed to the insulin of insulin .
3 A insufficient dose or the demo@@ li@@ tion of a treatment , especially in patients with ins@@ ul@@ inum diabetes , may lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia and a diabetic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ des ; they are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the change@@ over of one patient on another insulin type , or a insulin of a different manufacturer , should make a change in medical supervision and can be needed a change in the dose .
the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia depends on the effect of the insulin profile of the insulin profile and can therefore change the schem@@ atic of the schem@@ as .
substances which enhance the blood glucose levels , and inc@@ iner@@ ation of hypo@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , pent@@ oxi@@ fy@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ y@@ ph@@ en , S@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ate and Sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as Bet@@ ab@@ lo@@ osen , Cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ ane@@ thi@@ din and Reser@@ pin the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ to counter@@ pre@@ g@@ ulation or are missing .
animal studies show that no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ itarian in relation to the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ cated in human breast milk , but in general , insulin is neither in the milk &apos;s milk , it will res@@ um@@ ed after or@@ aler application .
the clinical trials known from clinical trials have been listed : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; not known ( frequency on the basis of the current ba@@ op@@ rene data are not available ) .

in a consequence of the injection of the injection of injection , Li@@ po@@ dyst@@ rophi@@ es was continuous to change within the injection range . Li@@ po@@ dyst@@ rophi@@ es can occur in the injection of injection .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ce@@ sper@@ ms with awareness can be given by a intra@@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , treated by intraven@@ ous treatment of glucose by a doctor .
following a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital should be monitored in order to determine the jud@@ g@@ inal thing for heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers blood sugar levels due to the risk of peripheral glucose levels ( especially due to skel@@ eton muscles and fat ) , as well as by inhibit@@ ing the glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that when sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of insulin @-@ insulin is faster and the drug @-@ duration is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal .
in a study involving 18 male people at the age of 21 to 50 years , insulin @-@ type implantation was disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ately high @-@ disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ate effect from .0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg or more propor@@ tioned increase of glu@@ ing effect , exactly as human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast as normal human rights and achieves the full feed effect of approximately 2 hours earlier than human rights .
from the data was confident that during an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine 2 minutes before the meal reached a comparable post@@ ure gly@@ ce@@ mic control , like with human normal , 30 minutes before the meal is given .
in 2 minutes before the meal , Insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was taken in 2 minutes before the meal was reached , a better post @-@ den@@ oun@@ cing control was given to the meal 2 minutes before the meal reached .
in 15 minutes , insulin l@@ is@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ cated 15 minutes after the start of the meal , becomes a comparable gly@@ ce@@ mic control as with human norm@@ alization which will be given 2 mi@@ - gro@@ ov@@ ings before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin l@@ is@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in with offering 2 minutes before the start of the meal was given at least 30 minutes ( normal - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1A ) as well as compared to human norm@@ alization that was given 2 minutes ( normal - previously ) before a meal given ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in with about 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN : later ) after the start of the meal in comparison to human nor@@ mals ( normal - before ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) before the start of the meal .
