<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Medicines Association (EPAR), in which the Committee for Humanity (CHMP) has evaluated the studies in order to get recommendations to the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or their treatment, please read the packing beilage (also part of the EPAR) or write to your doctor or pharmacies.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish to wish further information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg melting tablets (tablets, which solve itself in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirres Think and Speaking, Hallucinations (listening or saturation of things that are not available), missions and mental illness. in which the patient's disease episodes (Periods are alternately high) alternately with periods of normal tuning.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify the treatment of moderate to severe manure for the treatment of moderate to severe adhesives, and to prevent Manrists in patients who have been on the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is applied to fast control of increased lack or behaviours, if the oral intake of medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">For both diseases, the solution can be applied, or the melting tablets in patients are applied, the canyons of tablets is prepared.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who use other drugs simultaneously, the same as Abilify should be adapted to the dose of Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of the nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripibilzol is thought to be regarded as "partial agonist" for the receptors for neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-Hydroxytryptamine (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripibilzol such as 5-Hydroxytrypamine and dopamine, but in lower dimensions as the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-Hydroxycycline-schizophrenia with schizophrenia and biopoler, Aripibilzol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain to normalize psychotic or manic symptoms and will occur.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify, the re-launch of the symptoms, was investigated in three studies, up to a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of injection solution was reduced in two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases associated with increased accidents, over a period of two hours compared with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify has been associated with Hallify to 347 patients with Haloperdol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recovery to 160 patients who had already been stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injectors was conducted in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disturbance, which rose to an increased accidents, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change of symptoms of patients based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies to investigate how the body reduces the melting of the body and the solution to take up (up).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution showed that Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg were significantly improved significantly in the symptoms of the symptoms, which received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In application for the treatment of bipolar, Abilify in four of the five short-term studies are more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition to some 74 weeks, Abilify prevented the resamination of the rescures manganese episodes in previously treated patients and when it was given in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injectors in 10- or 15-mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms increased by increased accidents and were similar effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (free movement), headaches (sounding), headaches (sounding), swollen joint (soaked), red hyperbaric tion (elevated memory production), tiredness and exhaustion, Ruheloversity, Insomnie (sleep disorders), and anxiety disorders.</seg>
<seg id="25">The European Committee for Humanity (CHMP) has concluded that the benefits of Abilify the treatment of schizophrenia and led to the prevention of schizophrenia and in which the Ottoman Episoden on the treatment with Aripibilzol spoke, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control and behaviours of patients with schizophrenia or in patients with Ottoman Episoden in bipolar-I disturbance, if a oral treatment is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd., a approval of Abilify the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of a new Ottoman study in the Bipolar-I- disorder and for the prevention of a new Ottoman study in patients that were mostly manische episodes and whose manische episodes were indicated on the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day one day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages on a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, irrespective of meals as a single agent or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar-I- disorder with patients ≥ 65 years was not detected.</seg>
<seg id="33">Back to the bigger sensitivity of this group of patients should be considered to be considered in lower initial dose, if clinical factors are justify, (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiracy dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The presence of suave diseases belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, was reported in some cases after the start, or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, in treatment with Aripibilzol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disturbance, no increased superfood risk with Aripibilzol in comparison to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripibilzol should be used in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardinfants or ischemic heart disease, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure extraction) or hypertension (including acute and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyquinesia: in clinical trials, one year or less endurance, there were occasional reports on during the treatment with Aripibilzol occurring Dyskinesia.</seg>
<seg id="39">If you occur with ABILIFY treated patients and symptoms of a late dyskinesia, it should be noted to reduce the dose to reduce or treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient of signs and symptoms, developed on a mns, or even a clear fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, will be sold.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripibilzol should be used in patients with crab cases in the anamnese or with crabs that are related with Kramellancies in relation to be used.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old) with Aripibilzol patients who are associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripibilzol, an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was one of these studies, a study with fixer dosing, a significant relationship between the dosage and the appeal for adverse events in with Aripibilzol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely associated with ketacacia, or hyperosmolarem Koma or death, was reported in patients with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia events in with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drugs treated with the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsie, polyphenie, polyphagie and weakness) were observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus are being monitored regularly in terms of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">In general, this weight gain a weight gain in schizophrenia patients and patients with bipolar Manie due to antipoll use of antipsychotics in which weight gain as a side effect, respectively, and an inhealthy life and could result in severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">As a result of the primary effect from Aripibilzol on the central nervous system is necessary, when Aripibilzol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medication (see section 4).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid Blocker, reduces the resorption of Aripibilzol, but this effect is considered as a clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripibilzol, 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to expect other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoroxetine and paroxetine, similar effects, and therefore, similar dosing effects should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">For CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'Light'), the common application can cause a highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations from Aripibilzol resulting in comparison to CYP2D6 extensive metastases.</seg>
<seg id="53">If one knows the common offering of ketaconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4-Inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefit should potential the potential risks in the patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease, should have similar effects and should therefore be performed similar dosing solutions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors should be fixed at the dose of ABILIFY on the dose height before the beginning of the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY can be given together with ABILIFY, a steady increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, 10-30 mg of Aripibilzol have no significant effect on the metabolism of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">The people should be too difficult to notify their doctor, if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripibilzol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Because of the inadequate data to safety in humans and due to that in reproduction studies, this drug can not be applied to the pregnancy, because the potential benefit is clearly the potential risk for fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, in other antipsychotics, the patients should be warned against it, dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, to operate, until they are sure that Aripibilzol has not affect any negative impact on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medical-relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the below side effects is defined after the following criteria: often (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>

<seg id="69">A comparison between patient groups under Aripibilzol and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancement of the CPK (Kreatin-phosphokinase), generally temporarily observed and asyleucine, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripibilzol, compared to 2.0% of the treated patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects that occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, they include the malarious neurological syndrome, late dyspinesia and increased mortality in older dementia patients, Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials, and since the market launch, unintended or intentionally overburden of Aripibilzol alone have been observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg, and without a death follow.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the efficacy of a collusion with Aripibilzol; however, it is unlikely that hemoalysis is in the treatment of an overdose of benefit, since Aripibilzol has a high plasma proteins.</seg>

<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational two-blind study of schizophrenia (N = 18 or 13% of evaluable patients) in significantly less patients receiving a reduction of at least 7% compared to an average weight of at least 5.6 kg (i.e. an average weight of approx. 5.6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled Monotherapy studies with more flexible dosage more than 3 weeks with a Ottoman or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I error, Aripibilzol showed a placebo-driven efficacy in the reduction of reduction in symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled Monotherapy study conducted over 3 weeks with fixer dosage in patients with a Ottoman or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I error, Aripibilzol was not oversuperior to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo-and-controlled monotherapy studies in a bipolar-I disorder with or without psychotic mercury, Aripibilzol showed a positive effect on placebo in week 3 and a positive effect, which was comparable to lithium or Halludol show in week 12.</seg>

<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of a Bipolar-I disorder with or without psychotic features, some 2 weeks did not appear on Lithicker or Valproat monotherapy, showed an overnegative efficacy in the reduction of sensitive symptoms as opposed to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long term phase over 74 weeks in Ottoman patients with Aripibilzol, who showed a remission in response to the prevention of a bipolar return, mainly for the prevention of a return.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 is responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylic acid, the N-Dealkyzing is catalyzed by CYP3A4 catalytic.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average Eliminationshalbwerage is close to approximately 75 hours for Aripibilzol with extensive metamortising of CYP2D6 and in close to approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= 'Light') metadata about CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripibilzol, there is no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, and also showed no gender effects in a pharmacokinetic examination.</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is applied to the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes) in patients (particularly important patients) in which metformin (a diabetic medication) can be applied together with another diabetic medication (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition, in addition to metformin in patients (especially important patients), the metformin alone are not satisfactoried in the highest density dose alone.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a Sulfonylharnfuel or insulin delivery, insulin can retain the previous dose of sulphate treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of sulphate drug is reduced (low blood sugar).</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be used better, and blood sugar level decreases, which allows type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in Tripletherapy was investigated. patients received a combination of metformin with a Sulfonylharnstarch, in addition it received either Actos or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosyelled hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured as well as the blood sugar.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a reduction of the HbA1c value, which indicates that blood glucose levels were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Tripletherapy study showed the effect of additional treatment with metformin and a Sulfonylharnance in a reduction of the HbA1c values to 0.94%, while the additional treatment of placebo increased to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, patients who were treated in addition a reduction of HbA1c values of 0.69% to 6 months, compared to patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events in relation to Actos were visual disturbances, infections of the upper respiratory tract (caused sensitivity), weight gain and hypoanesthesia (reduced sensitivity to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Acetate may not be used in patients compared to Pioglitazone or another of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, heart failure, or diabetic ketacacia (high purity and blood cholesterol - in blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that in case of a single agent (when used in a single use) as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients, the metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission to the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited has been approved for the establishment of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, curved, carry on one side the mark "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is ininadequate due to contraindications or incompatible with contraindications (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">On the use of Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years are no data available, so the application will not be recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">Patients who are vulnerable to the presence at least one risk factor (e.g. former heart attack or symptomatic cardiac failure) to develop a decompensated heart failure should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain, or Ödeme, especially those with reduced cardial reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain, and Ödeme, when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and the existing disease infection was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study showed an increase of reports about heart failure, however, which led to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased starting liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard) or with other indications of liver illness, Pioglitazone can not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range are increased, the liver enzyme are as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">In the case a patient symptoms developed to indicate hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, scaffomnia, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark Harn, are the liver enzyme values.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to be continued whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazone, should be led by the laboratory of clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon a dosing-dependent weight gain, which can be associated with fat deposits and is connected in some cases with a liquid level.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodilution in therapy with Pioglitazon a small reduction in medium hemodynamics (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative studies with Pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemodynamics) and insulin (relative reduction of hemodynamics with 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin sensitivity, the Pioglitazon was used as oral branch or triple combination therapy with insulin-sensitive therapy, insulin-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the launch, using Thiazolidindignan, including Pioglitazon, a presence or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether it should be taking a direct connection between the taking of Pioglitazone and the emergence of a Makulaödems, if people were disruption of visual acuity, a suitable ophthalmological evaluation was supposed to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a unified analysis of melodic adverse events in a randomized analysis of randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies have treated more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="782">Fraction-incidence was 1.9 fragments per 100 patient-years with Pioglitazon treated women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the Proactive study, a study of 3,5 years in patients treated with Pioglitazon treated with Pioglitazon treated with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients were supposed to be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient wishes a pregnancy, or this one, is the treatment (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the interaction effects have shown that Pioglitazon had no relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dioxin, warfarin, phenoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Changeable effects with medicines that are metabolised by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium kanalblocker and HMGCoA Reductasinhibitor are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with vegetable fibroators (P450 2C8- inhibitors) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazon around the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8-Ingate) resulted in a reduction of AUC by Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that treatment with Pioglitazon is reduced in pregnancy, hypertension, and increased insulin resistance of the womb, thus reduces the availability of metabolic rate for serious growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very frequently &gt; 1 / 10; &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (derived data is not available).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the Turgor and Refraction of the lens, as they can be observed with other hypoglycemic ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, ALT-Anstiege included the triples of the standard range beyond placebo, but more rarely than in comparison groups under metformin or Sulfonylharnstarch.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced macrovascular disease was the frequency of a severe heart failure in Pioglitazone by 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazon is about.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, rarely over heart failure under Pioglitazone, however, if Pioglitazone has been used in combination with insulin ocerin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of melodic adverse events in a randomized analysis of randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies have carried out over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon groups and over 7,400 patients treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the period over a period of 3,5 years, Fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%) treated with Pioglitazon treated patients compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="797">In taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days were no symptoms on every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to act a activation of specific core receptors (peroxisome proliferation), which in animal model leads to an elevated insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeleton muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It was shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose reduction in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Glicladal as monotherapy was led over two years to examine the time to investigate the therapeutic effectiveness (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment rates).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the start of therapy, blood glucose control could be defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) by Pioglitazon at 69% of treated patients (compared with 50% of patients receiving Gliclamide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar were randomized to inadequate response phase with insulin resistance, too, to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to the patient who continued to have been insulin-treated with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials, there was a statistically significant decrease in Albatin / Kreatinin-Quotient in comparison to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (Monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18 weeks for the study of type-2 diabetic.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction of total plasma triglyceride and the free fatty acids and an increase of HDL- cholesterol levels as well as minor, but clinically increased LDL- cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon compared to placebo, metformin or gliclastomy the overall plasmatriglyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, there was no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels, while under metformin and Gliclamide levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazone did not only increase the triglyceride levels, this also improved the triglyceride-view to the triglyceride absorption as well as hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the Proactive study, a cardiovascular outpatient study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and the existing anti-diabetic patients were randomized to the existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After orable application, Pioglitazon will be resorable, with the top concentrations of concentration on unaltered Pioglitazon. usually 2 hours after application will be reached.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV contribution to the effectiveness in about three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, while relative to the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazon could not have been demonstrated at the pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetics of Digoxin, Warfarin, phenoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with mixes (P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with rifampicin (P450 2C8-Ingate) or the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral application of radioactive waste, Pioglitazon human beings was found mainly in the barrels (55%) and a lower extent in the Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-Eliminationshalbwerage of unaltered Pioglitazon is 5-6 hours, and the total active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazon and its metabolism are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers, whereby the rates of oral clearing of the womb were similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxikological studies in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys have agreed to a repeated administration controller with hemodilution, anemia, and reversible, eccentric, hypertrophies.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that treatment with Pioglitazone is reduced to blood glucose and increased insulin resistance of the womb, thereby reduces the availability of metabolic rate for serious growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), the increased incidence of hypertension (male and female rats) and tumours (with male rats) were induced in the urement epithelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the family syomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other Thiazolidindignants led to a increased incidence of colontine.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on a side the mark "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">Fraction-incidence was 1.9 fragments per 100 patient-years with Pioglitazon treated women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the Proactive study, a study of 3,5 years in patients treated with Pioglitazon treated with Pioglitazon treated with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study about two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazone or Gliclamide studied.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials, over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in Albanians in / Kreatinin-Quotient compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon was not only improved triglyceride levels, this also improved over a effect on the lacyglyceride absorption as well as hepatic Tryglizeride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study evaluated the goal of its primary endquality, non-deadly chemical syndrome, leg amparisation and Revascularisation of leg arteries, lay the results that with the intake of Pioglitazon no cardiovascular risk.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the mark "45" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of melodic adverse events in a randomized analysis of randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies have been treated with Pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients receiving a comparative study showed an increased incidence of bone broods in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the Proactive study, a study of 3,5 years in patients treated with Pioglitazon treated with Pioglitazon treated with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="832">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazon was not only improved triglyceride levels, this also improved triglyceride levels, which both of a effect on triglyceride absorption as well as hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was not used in a total of 294 patients with type 1 Diabetes, in which the pancreas can no insulin produce, and type 2 diabetes in which the body is not able to use insulin insulin delivery.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, after 12 weeks, concentration was measured in a substance (glycosyelled hemoglobin (HbA1c), which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c Spiegels that showed that blood sugar are similar to similar to other human RPE.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be applied in patients who are possibly excessive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">Moreover, the doses of Actraphane might be adapted to the doses of acetate may be given together with a number of other medicines that can be carried out on blood sugar (the complete list is the package list).</seg>
<seg id="869">The European Committee for Humanity (CHMP) has led to the conclusion that the benefits of Actraphane during treatment of diabetes compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">October 2002, the European Commission granted the Novo Nordisk A / S approval for the establishment of Actraphane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products usually be used either once or twice a day, if a quick initiating effect may be desired combined with a longer prolonged effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be at least 6 seconds long under the skin, to ensure that the total dose is injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved, for example, due to a intense insulin therapy, the hypoglycemia breakdown symptom changes, and should be correspondited accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any modification regarding strength, brand (manufacturers), insulin type (fast acting, bikers, long-term insulin), type of insulin (derived from recombinant DNA) can cause that a change of dosage is required.</seg>
<seg id="875">In case of using Actraphane in patients a dose adjusting for patients is needed, this is necessary in the first dose or months after the changeover, or in the first weeks or months after the change.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some people who reported hypoglycemic reactions according to a change of animal species, reported that the early warning symptom of a hypoglycemia, was less pronounced or differently than in their previous insulin.</seg>

<seg id="1412">Patients should always be maintained by the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out using the associated control of one in the transplantation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a changeover to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug application has to be carried out a therapeutic agent monitoring and corresponding dose adjustment to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus stays.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be in first line at clinical assessment of absorption and tolerability in individual cases and to blood vessels (see below "recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After upgrading in Advagraf at Advagraf, the Tacrolimus valley levels should be controlled in front of the changeover and over two weeks after upgrading.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Day 4 the systemic exposure time was measured as a valley-level, with both formulations of both kidney and transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the Tacrolimus-talview mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf in order to ensure appropriate substance exposure to the immediate transplantation period.</seg>

<seg id="1427">Other graft receivers had no clinical experience with Advagraf in lung, pancreas and cell transplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.10 mg / kg / day and when compared with transplant levels in a oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosing adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function in the target range of patients with severe liver function in patients with severe liver disorders are needed in patients with serious liver disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function, the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Based on the nephroxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, is a careful monitoring of kidney function (including a regular determination of serenquatrophy, an calculation of the creatinincance and a monitoring of the urevolume).</seg>

<seg id="1433">It is recommended to frequent controls of the Tacrolimus talview mirror during the first two weeks after Transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-level mirror from Tacrolimus should also be able to change changes in immunagraf, dosing, changes of immunoreressive therapy or with the same application of substances which could change the Tacrolimus whole blood concentration could be controlled (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Because Advagraf is a medicine with a low degree of clearing, may require adjustments of the dose for several days until the Steady State is entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials should be sure that a successful treatment in most cases is possible when the talview mirror in the blood 20 ng / ml does not exceed.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice the valley-level of Tacrolimus occur in full blood in the first time following liver transplantations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and low transplanted patients with 10-20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance of liver, kidney and cardiac transplantation, blood concentrations were used in the range of 5-15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft emissions or other side effects, which occur in a row of Tacrolimus sub- or exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always be maintained by the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes to the formulation or the regime should only be carried out by the dedicated control of one in the transplantation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For treatment adult patients with graft emissions, who proved to be proved compared with other immunoreressiva as refractory studies, are not yet a clinical data for the retardizing formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of the gravestment of adult cardiac transplant and graft are not included in the Kindesage, there are no clinical data for the retardizing formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible exchange effects, the tacrolimusability can lead to a reduction of the tacrolimus level, the intake of vegetal agents (Hypericum perforated), or other plant-absorbers during a treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with Diarrhö, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacorlimus- concentrations in the blood were offered, as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subjected to such circumstances in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, it was identified as a cardiomyopathy referred to as a cardiomyopathy, which can therefore be found in Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver function, infections, liquid load and furnaces.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Like with other immunoreressiva the effect of solar light or UV light because of the possible risk of skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a solar control with a high protection factor will be restricted.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as Hemmer or inductors of CYP3A4, can affect the metabolism of Tacrolimus, and therefore reduce blood pressure of Tacrolimus or reduce the blood values of Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is necessary to change the Tacorlimus- blood mirrors in the same range of substances that could change the CYP3A metabolism, control and the tacrolimus dose for maintaining low concentrations in the amount (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1454">Highly dosified prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as it is used in acute absorption reactions, the concentration of Tacrolimus can increase in blood or lower.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of Tacrolimus can be determined using CYP3A4 metabolised, which affects metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Because Tacrolimus reduced the Clearance of steroid contraceptives and increase the hormonal exposure, can be careful with decisions about the outstretched measures, especially cautious measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal have shown that Tacorlimus potentially reduced the clearing of pentobarbital and Phenazone and extend their seminal time.</seg>

<seg id="1531">The dosage and incidence of application is afterwards, whether Advate for the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures is applied.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffers from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in the joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not made from human plasma, but according to a method produced as "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell that has been brought to a gene (DNA) into a gene (DNA) that allows for the formation of the human barley in VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is a different European Union approved in the European Union, called Recombinate, however, is different, so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of patients with moderate to moderate hemophilia A, among them a study of 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was examined by the prevention of bleeding and surgery.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of Advate at the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood series has been awarded with "excellent" and "well-evaluated."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, headache, pyrexie (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be applied in patients who may not exceed sensitive (allergenic) of VIII, mouse or Hamor protein, or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">March 2004, the European Commission has approved the company Baxter AG a approval of Advate in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="1897">Following administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the immune system of the parts of the Grippevirus as "body-foreign" and forms antibodies against.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system later is able to form a contact with a flu virus this family's fast antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membranes of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membranes, which recognizes the human body as a body-stranded, is cleaned only) and used as an integral part of the vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="2045">The administration of Ampelvic with a meal leads to a 25% decline in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Ammiavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Thus, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the dietary intake of the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is about 430 liters (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg), as well as a non-suspended Penetration of Ammiavir from the blood circuit in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This amendment leads to a decrease in the concentration of drug in plasma, with the amount of unsolved Ammiavir, which remains the active share, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of uncoated amsavir is constant, fluctuated the percentage of free active ingredient in the Steady-State concentration in the Steady-State on the range of Cmax, ss up to Cmin, ss.</seg>

<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutralisation, thrombocytends and maximum non-hematorial toxicity as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A smaller toxicity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hematological and nichthhematological toxicity like neutropenia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was reduced when a treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore all patients with Pemetrexed patients are to be examined, folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophy- laktic measure to reduce toxicity of toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen and acetyllogistika (&gt; 1.3 g daily) must be used for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and surgery (see section 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi may be increased by the additional treatment of a Corticosteroids (a medicine which can be used as antiemedia).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years is not recommended because of the effects in this age group are not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance used in the case of a chemical substance in the body, 5-Hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as Serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three major studies at 1 842 adults, who received chemotherapy regimens, which are strong or even coverage for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">Chemotherapies for nausea and vomiting are 59% of patients treated with aloxi patients who received no vomiting (132 of 223) compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron treated patients (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">Chemotherapies for nausea and vomiting showed that 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi during the 24 hours after chemotherapy had no vomiting (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron treated patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005, the European Commission on Helsinki's Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. held a approval of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is Indian: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting at heavily emitted chemotherapy due to an advanced HER2-positive cancer and vomiting for the prevention of nausea and vomiting at moderate chemotherapy due to an advanced cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a heavily emitted chemotherapy, can be strengthened by adding one of the chemotherapy given by adding one prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">As Palonosetron can be extended to patients with anamnesty obstruction and signs of an subacute Ileus after the injection of the injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, like with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, is required to extend the application of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT- interval is extended or up to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with a further chemotherapy treatment, Aloxi was not used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In clinical trials, Palonosetron inhibits the activity of the five examined chemotherapy chemotherapy (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>

<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar results of adverse events such as in the other dosing groups, there were no dose of drug relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis is believed to be effective in a aloxification therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomized double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide (half hours) or 750 mg / m2 Cyclosetron (half-time) or 100 mg of Dolasetron (semiwertime 7.3 hours) received intravenously to day 1 without examinethason intravenously.</seg>

<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with greatly emitted chemotherapy are condensed into the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were similar to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the QTc interval with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of the clinical trials, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ventricular De- and Repolarisation List Ion channels and extend the duration of the promotional potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The survey conducted by 221 healthy volunteers were the assessment of the ECG effects of i.v. 0,25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous treatment follows an initiating decrease in the body with an average terminale elimination of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the surface under the curve-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportioned in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 / g / kg and cancer patients and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous treatment of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average average (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that the equivalent of 0.75 mg of Palonosetron received a total number of intravenous administration of 0.75 mg. however, the Cmax was measured after the lashing of 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by kidneys and approximately more 50% are converted into two primary metabolism, compared to Palonosetron, compared to Palonosetron, less than 1% of the receptor-inhibiting effect on 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metalising, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of pallets, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2.</seg>

<seg id="2643">According to a unique intravenous Bolts, the total body composition is 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function, the terminale Eliminationshalbwerder and the average systemic exposure of Palonosetron are increased, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, effects were observed only after expositions, which are considered sufficient on the maximum flow exposure to clinical use as sufficient for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From pre-clinical studies resulted in evidence that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels, which can be extend to ventricular De- and Repolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose was found in approximately 30 times the therapeutic exposure of liver cells, endocrine oprene (in thyroid, hypophysis, pankreas, ounierenmark) and skin treatments at rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the high dosages and because Aloxi is intended for the one-time application, the relevance of these results is low as for people.</seg>

<seg id="2673">It can be applied for the treatment of Impetigo (one with a cruising skin disease) and small ininfected Lazerations (Rissor and sections), amortisation and sewn Wear.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used for the treatment of infections, which have been extinguished or probably caused by methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo could not work against this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients with the age of nine months, but in patients receiving 18 years of skin, non-treat skin surface are not more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>

<seg id="2698">Drug Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of conromutilin, a substance that is isolated from the fermentation of Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction between the bacterial ribosom of the bactericians of the bacterial ribosom, which differs from the binders of other ribosses.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the rate of ribosomales protein L3 and in the region of the ribosomal P Binissalem and the Peptidyltransferase centre is.</seg>

<seg id="2702">If, on the basis of the local prevalence of resistance prevalence the application of retinapamulin at least some infectious forms, should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of retinapamulin compared to S.aureus, irrespective of whether the isolates are sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case a non-response to the treatment of S.aureus should be considered the presence of strains with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin).</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix are used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (disease which affect the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not used against these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambient light is applied during one of two doses of existing vaccines, whereby a protection against hepatitis B might be reached only after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, ambitions can only be used, if the immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is made sure that the order can be led to the end of two doses of the vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a differentiation dose against hepatitis A or B is desired, ambient light or another hepatitis B or B vaccines can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work, adding them to the immune system (the natural body of the body), "as it can apply against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the immune system and the surface antigens as "foreign d" and creates antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambient rix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twinrix, and since 1997 approved vaccine has been approved by the Twinrix vaccine since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix are given at one out of three doses of existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because ambirix and Twinrix are identical ingredients, some of the data that uses the application of Twinrix adults, also used as a ventilation for the use of ambient rix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main Indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of ggered children who had developed a protective antibodies after the last injection of the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six months and a 12-month intervals between the two injection.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambient light between 98 and 100% of the ggered children received a month after the last injectors to the development of a concentration of antibodies against Hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of ambient light are similar at a 6-month intervals between the injection and a 12-month distance.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of ambient light (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headaches, loss of appetite, pain in injection, tubes, matness (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambient rix in patients who are possibly excessive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic), not to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission granted the GlaxoSmithKline Biologized s.a. a permit for the instances of ambient light in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for Grundimmunzation with ambient rix consists of two vaccines, with the first dose of the choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">With the appropriate monovaline vaccines can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovaline vaccines or vaccinated with a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-Hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-Hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are equal to the same size as according to the vaccination with the corresponding monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully backed whether an immunological people who need to be vaccinated on a Hepatitis A of Hepatitis C, which may also be protected by the immunological memory for no more detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 How in all injection components should be available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the offering of the vaccination, for medical treatment and monitoring, always available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardised test, the 360 ELISA units are formininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2745">With hematalysis treatment and people with disruption of the immune system, an investigational anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody is achieved, so in these cases the offering of additional vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Because a intradermal injector or intramuscular administration may lead to a suboptimum Impact failure, these injection should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">With thrombocytopenia or blood clots disorders can be injected; however, as an incutaneous injection can be injected, as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When ambition is a separate injection, in the form of a separate injections (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or with a combined Masern- Mumps vaccines, the immune response was given to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients under immunoreressive therapy or in patients with immunodefects, it may be achieved that no longer immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study that leads with 3 vaccination of this formulation in adults, was the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matures, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever comparable to the disease which was observed in earlier Thiomerang and preservative vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccine doses were given at 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years the tolerability of ambitions were compared with the 3-doses of the 3-cans.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher skins of pain and matures on an calculation base per vaccines ambirix, but not on an calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the treatment of ambient rix at 50,7% of the subjects were observed, compared to 39.1% for the treatment of a dose of 3-cans.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccine cycle, 66.4% of the persons who had given ambition to the ambient conditions, over pain, compared to 63.8% in subjects who were vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The incidence of mud was similar to similar (i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who were amurix compared with 36,2% for subjects who received the 3 cans (doses).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency supplemented pain and matures was low and comparable to the administration of the combination of a combination of the 3-cans vaccine was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1-11-year-old vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambitions are comparable with 360 ELISA units formininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, during the 6- to 11- year-old, however, after vaccination with ambient light, there was a sacral occurrence of pain (at the injection of the injection) per dose, not per proband.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The percentage of vaccines, which have severe adverse events during the 2-doses vaccination with a combination of the 360-doses vaccination with 360 ELISA virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface, was statistically significant.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials, which were conducted at the age of 1 to 15 years were the serum rates for anti-HAV 99,1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, for the month 6.</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% per month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, for a month, 6 per month (i.e., in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">A comparative study that was carried out at 12- to including 15-year-old, 142 two doses of ambition and 147 the standard combinationers with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenesis was observed (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the treatment of 3-dose rate significantly higher than with ambient rix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which have been achieved in a clinical study study at 1-11-year-old one month after the end of the full vaccination series (i.e., in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccine will be either a 2-doses vaccination with ambient light or a 3-doses vaccination with a combination-to-use hepatitis B virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2767">Persons who at the time of Grundimmacterization between 12 and 15 years old, the incidence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs was demonstrated at least 24 months after immunisation with ambient light in the 0-6 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response was comparable to both antigens which was used after implantation of 3 cans with a combination-resistant Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">A clinical study of 12- to including 15-year-olds could be demonstrated that the incidence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBB was comparable to immunisation in the 0-6 month vaccine, comparable to the 0-12 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of ambition in a combined diphtherize, tetanusurem, and 8 Haemophilus have been given to the vaccine type b vaccination (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or the first dose of a combined mask-Mumps vaccines, was the immune response to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study that was performed with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults, showed similar seroprotective and seroconversions as for the previous formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2805">On the basis of data, which became known since the opening of the first permission, the CHMP has made the view that the benefit-risk proportion of ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, only in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient.</seg>
<seg id="2807">On the age of more than a month, Ammonisation can also be found in the history of more than a month with incomplete Enzymous encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonium concentrations) in the history of history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps is split by several individual doses of meals - split by the food or via a Gastrostomitic (by the stomach from the stomach) or a nose probe (by the nose in the stomach of the hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">This was not a comparative study, because Ammonaps did not occur with another treatment or placebo (a patient's treatment, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">The Ammonaps can also cause loss of loss in blood, depression, irritability, headaches, irritability, flavoring or flavour-outs, abdominal pain, nausea, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odorch or weight increase.</seg>
<seg id="2811">For Humanity (CHMP), the European Committee for Humanity (CHMP) has concluded that Ammonaps in patients with disruption of the ureous cycle of ammonium values are effective.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonaps was approved under "extraordinary circumstances, because because of the worseness of the disease, only limited information on this drug was not limited.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use of all patients is indicative in which a complete Enzymdeficiency is already manifested in newborage (within the first 28 Lebage).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifixed form (incomplete Enzymous defect), an indication of the use for use when in the Anamnese, there is a hyperAmmonese encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For babies who are not able to swallow for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with canckdisorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually adapted under consideration of the protein tolerance and the development of the daily protein intake of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2817">After previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutylene: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg - 13,0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg, as well as in-growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early lack of carbamylphosphate ynthase or ornithintranscarcylase, the substitution of Citrullin or arginine is needed in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatsynthase deficiency must be arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 / 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with rackdisorders, because there are no risk of risk for the emergence of oil tusulcera, if the tablets were not able to reach the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium chloride, which equates the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with conspicuous heart failure, or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and liver abnormalities only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As metalising and removal of sodium phenylbutylene above the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used for patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS while the pregnancy is contraindications (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">When subcutaneous treatment of phenylacetate to young rats at high dose (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown of neuronal formations and increased to an increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed friction coefficient of zerebrals synapses and a reduced number of work neurons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be found that Phenylacetate is taken into the breast milk, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contrasted in terms of contraindications (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at 56% of patients receiving at least an adverse event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events was assumed that they did not deal with AMMONAPS in conjunction with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old emangiopathy in combination with lactic acid, severe hypokalanemia, panzytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pankreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">One case of an overdose stood with an accidental dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg) with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of Phenylacetate, which showed a dosing limit of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic compound which is characterized by acetylzing with glutamine to Phenylacetylglutamine, which will be marked by the kidney.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Frachiometrically, Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds include 2 nitrogen oxide); phenylacetylglutamine is suitable as an alternative carriers for the separation of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disruption of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram of bias of sodium chloride, between 0,12 and 0,15 grams of Phenylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important to improve the diagnosis and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early symptoms in the newborage was almost always infaust, and the disease led itself on the treatment with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids or with their stics-free Analoga within the first years of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemoalysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide (sodium chloride), protein reduced Kost and possibly substitution of essential amino acids was possible to increase the survival rate in postpartal (however within the first life month) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy and the disease was diagnosed in the pregnancy of a hyperophaemorrhage group, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with many to mental disabilities or other neurological issues.</seg>

<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficit are also hardly recurrent in treatment and in some patients can occur further deterioration of the neurological issues.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that Phenylbutylene can oxidiate to Phenylacetate, which is produced in liver and kidney, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of Phenylbutylene in plasma and urine were determined after the treatment of a single dose of 5 grams of sodium chloride and patients with liver cirrhosis for single delivery as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of Phenylbutyrat and its metabolism was also studied for cancer patients after intravenous treatment of sodium chloride (up to 2 g / m ²) or Phenylacetate.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is applied to treat patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart) for instance at an unstable Angina (with different strength) or myokardinfection market (heart failure) without "Strengthening" (an abnormality value for electrocardiogram or EKG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">Angiox for preventing blood clots are applied in patients who use a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be resumed up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to patients with Angina or heart failure to maintaining the blood flow into the heart and the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS for a few treatment or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, a different medicines for preventing blood clots) with heavier treatment (another anticoagulans) and a GPI compared to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While the PCI was often suffering a stent (a short Röhrchen, which remains in the arteries, and they also received other drugs to preventing blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was angiox - with or without the gift of GPI, with closure of new events (deaths, cardiac abnormalities or Revascularization) after 30 days and a year as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI system, angiox in relation to all indicators are as effective as leparin, except for heavy blood vessels, in which it was more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox must not be applied in patients who may have no sensitive (allergic) against bivalirudine, other Hirudine or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who had a blood pressure, as well as people with strong blood pressure or serious kidney problems, or a heart rate.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The European Committee for Humanity (CHMP) has reached the conclusion that angiox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is an removable replacement for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">September 2004, the European Commission granted the Medicines Company UK Ltd, a approval of angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (instabile Angina / Non-ST-lever) (IA / NSTEMI), if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended dose dose of angiox in patients with ACS is a intravenous Bolusages of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>

<seg id="2896">Safety and efficacy of a few Bolus treatment of angiox was not studied and is not recommended, even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">This value (ACT after 5 minutes) was reduced to below 225 seconds, should be a second round of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT, the reproductive and diluted out in front of the use is carefully connected and the Bolusefly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value amounts to more than 225 seconds, a further monitoring is not necessary, provided 1.75 mg / kg of infusion dose.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Patients with moderate kidney-function test (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are exposed to a PCI (whether with bivalirudine or not), should be used in a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h.</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients have been carefully monitor during treatment in terms of symptoms and indications of bleeding, especially if Bivalirudine are given in combination with another anticoagulans (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Although in PCI-patients under Bivalirudine, most blood vessels occur in arterial points, can occur in patients who occur in a Peruvian correlation (PCI) while treatment in principle anywhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2908">Patients who use Warfarin and with Bivalirudine should be drawn to a monitoring of the INR value (International normised ratio) to ensure that the value of treatment with bivalirudine come again in front of the treatment level.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the anti-action mechanism of antikoagulun (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or thrombocytends) can be assumed that this active ingredients increase the blood circulation.</seg>

<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that when subcutaneous Ga- be of insulin-insulin is faster and the drug-duration is shorter than at hu- manem normal.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male people at the age of 21 to 50 years, insulin-type implantation was disproportionately high-disproportionate effect from .075 to 0.15 E / kg or more proportioned increase of gluing effect, exactly as human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has twice as fast as normal human rights and achieves the full feed effect of approximately 2 hours earlier than human rights.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data was confident that during an application of insulin lulisine 2 minutes before the meal reached a comparable posture glycemic control, like with human normal, 30 minutes before the meal is given.</seg>
<seg id="2997">In 2 minutes before the meal, Insulinglulisin was taken in 2 minutes before the meal was reached, a better post-denouncing control was given to the meal 2 minutes before the meal reached.</seg>
<seg id="2998">In 15 minutes, insulin lisluliscated 15 minutes after the start of the meal, becomes a comparable glycemic control as with human normalization which will be given 2 mi- groovings before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lislulisin with offering 2 minutes before the start of the meal was given at least 30 minutes (normal - 30 min) before the start of the meal (figure 1A) as well as compared to human normalization that was given 2 minutes (normal - previously) before a meal given (Figure 1B).</seg>
