what is a digital management unit - away from the fashion face ? digital inventory management has been made up to financial statements and permanent storage . each of the photos took up , sc@@ anned or digital photos , leads a form of digital inventory management . however , most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips as you can send us to the methods for digital photographers ; we &apos;ll be able to convert and convert photos to convert , group@@ ing , secure , evaluate , tra@@ ck@@ down , archive , optimi@@ ze , wait and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; digital inventory management takes on , indi@@ ising , categ@@ orized , conver@@ ts , search@@ es , trans@@ forming , conver@@ sions , and exported content that offers a mon@@ et@@ ary or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ adata are defined as data via data . met@@ adata are specified according to your data , information about or a documentation of other data provide support from an application or environment .
I &apos;m looking for if you don &apos;t know more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t use or digi@@ ous . if you don &apos;t want to save the met@@ adata fields both in a database and to save the image files and safe archi@@ ving you can access to other programs , platforms and formats .
this is what you need to do and know what you need to do in your system . you must decide if you want to store your photos on your computer , if you want to save them on a network drive &amp; etc ; be sure that you need to change sometime at a larger drive .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . the other pictures can be found in several times on the same place . if you have sufficient photos , then you will be able to use the folder such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is a folder for you to print or publish on a web page .
professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archi@@ ving , working procedures , constant strain of images at different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files and you will not want to organize your structure for these content .
what kinds of files fit together ? the separation of data types makes the pile processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and unemployment files is simpli@@ fied a backup strategy and migration . you &apos;ll always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture .
we also recommend the option met@@ adata to the met@@ adata objects into the files . if you don &apos;t forget that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be written into the file . if you don &apos;t forget to save the met@@ adata out of the database into the files that select the same point in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens when you want to change ? to say &amp; digi@@ tization ; them have a met@@ adata Editor for a number of selected attribute . these are of course the most important .
now the real work starts , since you should choose any photo postcards , labelling and an assessment . of course , you can choose the same attribute , and then set the value . you start the best with an evaluation or the leader@@ board . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the top photos .
let us go with key@@ words , key@@ words , how to continue with other programs frequently , or categories . all three are syn@@ onymous for the same thing .
if you have cat@@ ti@@ zing images from another source with embedded samples , then it becomes no problem for you to build up to another source . the change of Hier@@ archy in the building is no problem , and can easily be done by the digi@@ ms to another . the modified sample may be done by &amp; digi@@ ous ; it is updated during the lower trees .
the graph shows how different met@@ adata . this is a very large representation of representation , since each block is composed of met@@ adata in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are all qualities of all images .
enough of the key@@ words - the next section refers to labelling or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ ze your met@@ adata .
you want to let most anyone who simply let your photos you want to share your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to get interested in your photos .
look at this panorama . from the Fer@@ ne is not even a beautiful beach @-@ panorama . if you &apos;re looking closer , you start to see some details , people who do space .
and now I tell you this one of the landing site of Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha beach quot ; in the French town of Nor@@ mand@@ y , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . so , you may even hear your perception of this panorama window .
for others , the title may be more important than the picture itself to create a interest . if you have images , the key is to transfer it to the viewer , which is to help me about the motive , which you moves to understand what you understand what you understand .
it &apos;s in order if a picture is not perfect , if the strength has only works with a labelling for themselves alone .
with &amp; digi@@ tization ; you can download it a lot of text in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) . if you are export to your wishes for your wishes to the labelling and / or the title of Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . they have to tell the story so for the opening , not a second time .
remember the days before GPS ? when you had to find into another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet before Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train the train takes place now with light speed .
these possibilities are con@@ spic@@ uous . I am sure that one day , in the near future you can continue using Google Earth . then , the pictures can also be export with Google Earth . they can also be export to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice the copyright rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same freedom are also valid in all ge@@ ared versions , so also for the work of other .
the following description says you information in the main site of &amp; delivery ; as information is stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for writer and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the photographers , then it can &apos;t be used . after this value , it should not be changed . after this value , he should not be changed . this field does not support Semi@@ kol@@ ons as a partition .
author &apos;s author ( syn@@ onym for the Constitutional Treaty ) : associated with the author . examples include : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independence of commercial photographer . since this is a memor@@ andum to authori@@ zation , must be filled with this as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for vendors ) : use the author &apos;s provider to identify the picture . if the photographer must be listed here as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then you can offer this picture . if the picture is a repository picture , then the group / agency is provided here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although these do not need any protection against mis@@ use . this is a digital water@@ mark . for private individuals , this is the majority of your photos only from low interest . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important for professionals .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the near future , there will be such a module for the st@@ acking processing .

of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs on the street or a fire . these kind of losses are the same as you can also pass at the traditional paper photos or negative . in this section it goes to problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data re@@ programming company in the world , has some interesting statistics showing the reasons for a data loss .
in order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , you can buy even longer than a few years of mind . there are also offers more than gold coated DVDs , &amp; Dollar ; 2 pieces will make a life time of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe that this is in your meas@@ ur@@ meas@@ ur@@ ation .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be able to read this risk in which you can use good discs and good recording devices . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the che@@ ap@@ est , but you can write a lot of reliable . therefore , this is the right choice .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even though you have just written a control mechanism . despite this massive protection , it is required for formations and control systems . despite this massive protection it is required by chemical supplies , Ultra@@ violet light , cr@@ at@@ zer , dust &amp; etc ;
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a cheap program called Iso@@ Bu@@ ster that doesn &apos;t work with CDs and DVDs . there are also similar applications the damaged data of damaged disks , hard drives , Flash@@ media , USB drive works , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to save up to HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB for the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all for CDs and DVDs , it is also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disc .
if you &apos;re looking for a high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ quality media . if you decide to check the media with a description , date and author password . don &apos;t forget to copy the data on the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturers guarantee a new disk , but not the data . Google represents a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks : disc@@ us@@ ers
shortly : Dis@@ ks keep the most common error of the error of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at a lower temperature range , SM@@ ART can &apos;t find this mistake . some of the SM@@ ART error occurs in particular Les@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and publishing counter . the unexpected life time is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss of loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you may have data loss because if you have secured the files , but these losses can be copied without great problems .
while most electrical devices are not enough , it can take heavy damage to devices with computer chips and high speed process , these anom@@ ali@@ es damage , destroyed mother@@ boards and other def@@ ective . if you use even before the un@@ avoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against electricity points is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is part of the energy consumption and is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ bar . do not remember that any plug @-@ in is also available in the form of power .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a specific minimum of protection . you should also be careful to protect the protection against lightning strikes .
as a power supply can be connected to your computer system , you should make sure that all periph@@ erals can also be connected to your modem . some manufacturers make a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of cable mode@@ ms and the TV map .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable @-@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore also include the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for you .
during an over@@ voltage protection your system in front of smaller fluctu@@ ations are not really help in a complete failure . even a few seconds can lead to the loss of unbe@@ atable data . therefore , it can be useful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to the protection , these devices can automatically get up to electricity . some models allow them to go back up to electricity . if you are able to buy the same quality requirements as a low @-@ voltage protection . furthermore , the battery life of the battery and the surrounding software is interesting .
concerns the potential risk that your computer system is to prevent up to &amp; euro ; 20 cost , A 500@@ W US@@ V you can think about it as well as your calcul@@ ator . finally , you should think about all the cable to tr@@ enne before you drive into the holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use this as drive under Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software . Google Shared Storage is a further popular offering to data from any amounts of data .
however , they are very expensive in comparison to the hard drives at home - 40 GB per dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; Dollar ; 500 . furthermore , you must send the data on compar@@ atively slow Internet .
these solutions are therefore suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but it &apos;s not a general safety solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com will provide you more efficiently on photos stored in the case of Fli@@ ck@@ r . for $ 25 a year , you will get unlimited memory that will be checked in reality .
data from the data backup are very safe . transfer rates are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol automatically adjusted and with the big companies the offer of backup and a partially covered memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transmission system are suscep@@ tible to transmission error . the fil@@ esystem will be at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst failure is that no one thing happened in your hardware . it is rather un@@ troubled that it should not be put in your computer . no one doesn &apos;t seem to have any protection in your computer . no one seems that the Internet with its TCP uses is a much more secure data away than that of your computer .
reliable power supplies are another source for transfers , since they generate Inter@@ e@@ preferences within the data stream . with normal file systems remain un@@ noticed this error is un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not particularly affected by Transfer payments , you should look into the future . in 2010 you &apos;ll see thousands of bugs a year .
Z@@ FS &apos;s Sun Micro@@ systems appears to be one of two candidates . it &apos;s open @-@ source , with many patents and is available under one of the GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in the alpha @-@ status . it is the same protection mechanisms used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it &apos;s not part of the kernel .
under@@ estimate these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % for working systems . not@@ ebooks , in not@@ ebooks , the proportion of ste@@ els will be 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the most of viruses . it is not limited to Microsoft systems , such as theft and new installations . and it is currently not only a few viruses and under Linux ; it has been sigh@@ ted on a few viruses .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : false , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS file . a very good English items will find here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : false , only the speed of the investig@@ ators process during a surgery is higher and a defined status is avoided . however , if a file is not completely saved before the problem is lost , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat for digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors selected by digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 ap@@ ert@@ ing settings of fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while technology is further developed there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and noise @-@ characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go down in the direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even if this dissolution is good for a compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ apixel cameras . for higher resolutions , you require a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard drive is currently being responsible for 100 &amp; euro . therefore , you might be able to secure your data from any loss of data loss . so , you &apos;ll want to secure your data often as the re @-@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of panels or the size change of hard disks .
suppose you are supposed to make your sick@@ ness on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash is short@@ ened , if the drive was not associated with the moment .
a disaster took place locally and destroyed a lot . don &apos;t forget aircraft accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and ste@@ els are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect an entire room or the whole house .
therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ vor@@ beu@@ f always does not have local storage . bring your sick@@ ness to the steps , into the neighbouring house , in your office or similar .
there is an additional advantage of the physical separation : as above already said , is a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup is not available immediately , then you can save the one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files are backed up . it is a moment@@ um with history without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential : a backup of files which have been changed since the last complete operation . creates a complete sn@@ apshot @-@ up to two periods : the complete backup and the last differential locking .
a variety of files that have been changed since the last backup has been changed . you can use the original status at any time again . these backup will be back to such a ver@@ sion@@ ing system at the next with the exception that it is only sam@@ pled and not prog@@ ressing .
rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily install your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP , or other types of file association scripts only the difference of files really changed . this happens , and if you want to increase the safety over ss@@ h .
secure significant pictures directly after you have stored on your computer a DVD or another op@@ tic medium .
in the end , you can get enough time to explore losses and again . at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly res@@ um@@ ption for at least one month and a moment@@ um for each month . each other out@@ age should be done manually , after which you have a complete review .
topics : met@@ adata , showing XMP files , original file , autom@@ ates XMP files , original file , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images and met@@ adata , copy images on the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment , ... , to use the Internet .
thus valuable images the next 40 year survival , that is about the time period in you really interested in your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be noted :
as the future because of your nature un@@ fore@@ se@@ eable : all 5 @-@ 8 years should be considered . unfortunately , there are no other possibility to stand out like the current system . if less variants they were used in the past , the easier is the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered using the explan@@ ations in this document . use or change the open standards which are supported by many applications .
virtualization is nowadays available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important to reading your images , then store it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and sc@@ er@@ technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay in open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist printing for the possibility to change a system in size . this means actually enlarge .
let &apos;s go out that you want the scal@@ ability using a dedicated plate or partition . if you want to have a dedicated plate or partition used . in * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and put on a new record .
check the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new plate is detected , but depend on it .
&amp; / dev / s@@ db ; par@@ ted / dev / s@@ db ; par@@ ted in MB@@ 3 / dev / s@@ db ; size of the record in MB@@ 2,3 ; # does not work with ext@@ 2,3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; Dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / cor@@ c@@ 1 # .dll to the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day does not read the software there , then you can create these themselves . this task is easier by year to a year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format which is slow by the market . you should not use it any more .
PN@@ G has been developed as an open source standard , XMP , ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ ad@@ ates , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . PN@@ G can not be used for improved color information , but not as many as T@@ IFF . this format would like to recommend you to store your images .
T@@ IFF was widespread than image format . T@@ IFF can be saved in un@@ compressed shape or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression ( default ) . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted to many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digital Negative file format is a free and open touch formats . DN@@ G is now being developed on the T@@ IFF / EP by the help of the help of met@@ adata . DN@@ G is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
this is probably one of the reasons why to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource quot ; , a mix of XML and R@@ DF . it is a file information that allows users to integrate it into one file itself . the file information are stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .@@ x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers make it a picture of your recording , mostly in raw file format . it can be used to problems with the link between met@@ adata and image file and how above already mentioned the raw format . therefore , you should use DN@@ G as a container and put it all there together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization that supports working on a architecture and modeling , discussions and community work in D@@ C@@ MI groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and awareness efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the sc@@ anners . so long the pictures on the camera &apos;s camera can be used as a temporary backup .
convert Roh@@ files to DN@@ G and store this in your Roh@@ Archives . this function is not implemented .
for a sensitive editing , you can use external programs . if you were able to add the images again with &amp; digi@@ ous ; then , you should add the met@@ adata to the other programs .
use the revised images for copyright law with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in Web@@ Gal@@ eries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact , print &amp; etc ;
the camera @-@ interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ous ; in the section he add photos you can already add on your hard drive . the camera @-@ interface provides you a lot of advanced settings for import@@ ing from images to your Alb@@ at@@ at@@ ee .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ous ; to use your digital camera , connect the camera to display mode , switch the camera on display mode , and turn it into a further description of your camera , please refer to the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , this is a while using your camera . some cameras are displayed at the lower end and if this is the case , the file name is displayed and a symbol for file association for each file , photos , films , music etc . on the camera .
before you need to download the photos on your computer , you may need to see the camera information to any entry . with the side@@ bars features and met@@ adata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an agreement or met@@ adata .
this dialogue shows file characteristics and the photo information that internally are stored by the camera . an icon shows that the image was not downloaded on your computer . please note that at some digital cameras don &apos;t have any information available .
the rider met@@ adata displays the internal metal rates such as Ex@@ if , Manufac@@ ture , GPS etc . this information is the same as the met@@ adata objects from the main window of the digi@@ tization ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ adata are not available at some digital cameras .
the easi@@ est way to download photos on your computer download and then download the photos of your camera into one single album in &amp; digi@@ tization ; for downlo@@ ading the photos are not deleted , and we recommend you check images sure the pictures will be sure to delete the photos from the camera .
if you want to download all photos you want to download the required standard methods of &amp; K@@ DE , you can download the kno@@ bs and then run the button . download the button for download , until you have chosen some photos .
if your camera supports this , you can &apos;t download it . these images have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ ous ; in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in advance . if you choose this option , the new pictures will be downloaded from the new pictures .
if you can download the buttons for download or so far , a dialogue with which you can select the photos stored in which the photos are sorted . details on the files you can read in the section of My albums . then select the target album from the list and press you OK .
after you have chosen the target album , press the OK , and &amp; digi@@ ous ; invites the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them by the camera . if you want to er@@ ase all the button . if you want to delete the button . if you want to er@@ ase only a few er@@ ase you need to connect this first and subsequently be chosen .
please note that there will not be able to restore images from the camera . you should have been carefully check if the photos should be able to delete them from the camera . if you want to er@@ ase your camera , you should make sure that you want to do the camera system because this is much faster .
cameras use as a file name for the photos are often used in the photos taken after the photos taken from the camera . so , if you can load photos of different recording studios in the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time , in which the picture was taken to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section you will find options for thresh@@ ing and spy . if you use this final option , you will automatically create a file per day .
the options of the transmission opens three other options which will be stored on the record . if you select this , the respective entries will be copied to the IP@@ TC field . with the last option , you can correct date and time for all downloaded pictures .
if you wish to use a different file format as the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % - % % H % H : % S : % S . switch to the option &apos; date and time . for more customi@@ z@@ ations you should read the help of the last time .
if you use the camera @-@ file name , you have the possibility to change the file name in small letters . or in large letters , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ ous ; for a photo is displayed below the name , the camera is displayed in the preview . your settings are stored and automatically used if you open the camera &apos;s next time .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; can do all information about the orientation of the camera to be able to perform automatic rotation throughout the way . not all cameras provide information on this information . in the section of page bar met@@ adata , you can read more details about the camera that embedded in the photograph .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and when your camera does not supplies this information , the photo in the original orientation . if you want the automatic spin , use the button and select the automatic rotation in the lower area of the F@@ enst@@ ers .
when your camera information about the date , at which the picture is made available , can be loaded to the image records . these are all cameras with the same date you can download this information . in the section of the met@@ a @-@ data you can read that information on the camera was embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case you want to change the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , please use the button , and select the option to set up the set @-@ based lower attachment at the lower end of the F@@ enst@@ ers .
the easi@@ est way to upload photos from their computer to upload , is the button . select the files stored on your camera . you can select the files stored on your camera . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods .
after image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ tization ; you , where the pictures should be uploaded . a folder dialog for the camera appears . select the desired file and press you OK to restart the pictures . photos will not delete the pictures from your computer .
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a universal term in this document . this is a position which can be displayed in length and lati@@ tude , and the data may be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional photography , it can be interesting to c@@ ess@@ ful a picture with a precise use of GPS data . environmental plan@@ er , military , police , architecture office and real estate agency may be able to use this capability .
if you don &apos;t forget to open a browser if you want to open a browser to another &amp; digi@@ ous ; users can send a postcard on the site of the photos , or simply can only document these aspect , it &apos;s good to enter the posi@@ tional data of a photos .
the question is to come , how the GPS data will come into this field ? first , you should have at least three ways to reach this field . directly with the right hardware , more than a re@@ editing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geographical association ( manual ) and most recently about the input of well @-@ known locations .
as far as we know , there is no camera that integ@@ rates a GPS unit . but there is a couple who work with GPS receiver . either as a card module or by using the data via a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G3 Sony
downlo@@ ading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or G@@ PS@@ Babel . you must save these data but in GP@@ X format , because this is the only format that is supported by the module for the ge@@ ographi@@ cal assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract the data from images and cor@@ relate , and cor@@ relate , on the following page , you can make the same under &amp; Linux : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the lengths of long@@ itude and break , or other data , then you can use this script which works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool by Phil Harvey . it uses the prevention of balance that are prepared for example from En@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
En@@ cyclo@@ pedia states there are no European street types . here are some European pages , at least on French , German and Spanish , which all navigation details for Europe show .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; to give you much control over his working course , you &apos;ll need to change the behaviour of the digi@@ tization ; you &apos;ll need to change the settings of the digi@@ tization ; set up in eight pages . you can choose between these change by using the symbols of the left @-@ hand side .
this can select a editing preview or image processing . they put the standard behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization ; fixed , if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and legal data . these data are automatically written in the respective IP@@ TC data fields if the option is synchron@@ ised from the camera interface . the data is synchron@@ isation in the IP@@ TC field .
author &apos;s author is a syn@@ onym for the author &apos;s author : this field should contain a photographer , as well as a freelance photographer , as well as independent photographer or independent , commercial photographer . because this is a further details on the authori@@ zation field , it must be filled to be filled .
publishers is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this box for example , if this is not the author , as well as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , these organizations have to be registered here . if the picture is a repository picture , then the group should be available , then it should be available here .
the IP@@ TC @-@ actions store the data in the respective IP@@ TC field . this means that the met@@ adata are not only available in the database of &amp; digi@@ ous ; these met@@ adata are also available in other programs and can be imported into &amp; delivery without lost .
images depic@@ ts the comments as an embedded tro@@ duc@@ ts ( J@@ F@@ IF ) , which allows you to read your photos from the images of embedded images . attention : at images which already contain labelling , they are written by the delivery of the digi@@ tis@@ ation .
the page contains all options for information that appear if the mouse is in the main window over one file . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not .

the default settings can be reset back , by implementing the button on the right of each category .
the settings of the illuminated &amp; digi@@ ous settings can be switched on this page . some pictures have different sizes and synchron@@ ous mode . if you don &apos;t have to use the option &amp; quot ; if you have a better machine , you can only receive a better performance results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select this here . you can use the tool bar , if you use image editing in full @-@ mode mode .
full and sub@@ marine areas can be marked with dark or brigh@@ ter colour in the picture . these colours will be set here . in image editing , this application mode can be switched on F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance is enco@@ ded into the color cards . please read this article in Wikipedia for the detailed explanation .
with the PN@@ G @-@ compression , you can reduce the size of PN@@ G files . the only effect is that the image data is more time for align@@ ing and un@@ pack . if you have a quick computer , you can put this value to a high compression . thus , 1 : low and 9 is a high compression .
with the T@@ IFF files , you can modify the default de@@ compression of the T@@ IFF file for T@@ IFF &apos;s images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IFF pictures . it has no impact on the image quality , since the default algorithm is los@@ s@@ free .
if you select the loss of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , if you select the loss of quality loss and file size much better than in normal JPEG . when this paragraph , Met@@ adata were not supported , but it was not yet found in planning .
in the previous versions of &amp; digi@@ ous , image processing only came to photos . at the moment , the image processing only develops into a tool for manipulation of your photos . in this dialogue , you can change the settings of image processing .
the standard gain is that all green pixels are equal . if you use this option , if you use this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option is a bit soft , elim@@ in@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 G@@ ed pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white arrow is used in the camera . otherwise , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white equ@@ alizer is not set . standard is a fixed color balance that was photographed on a white map which was photographed on a white map .
this setup is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the benefit of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ scores images in four steps more details in the hair@@ line . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
the standard is the top @-@ lights , so the parts of your camera are burned down in the settings . the colors solve some unusual results in various ros@@ at@@ ö@@ nen . most recently , you can try some parts of the missing information from top @-@ cat@@ ches .
this is possible because blue pixels in general is not as fast as green and red . they are trying to re@@ construct the lack of green and red pixels . of course this is a question , how much color or white you want .
if you select the option to set any level , you get the possibility to set a level . here &apos;s a value of three is a compromise , and can therefore be adjusted for each picture .
set the L@@ umin@@ ance on your taste . you have to set it some higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the picture options of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; -@@ image processing . in order to keep the time for Dem@@ os@@ a@@ ic@@ ing , you should be conservative .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ ic@@ ing algorithm is a digital image process that comes from a complete picture of part @-@ fil@@ tr@@ ing image sensor , which are many cameras , and a matrix of colour @-@ pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ frame .
the first algorithm used for me : bil@@ ing@@ ear , V@@ N@@ G inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was used . however , V@@ N@@ G inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ ft ) was used . however , it produces color vision to the edges . bil@@ ing@@ ear is interesting , if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color deviation of your l@@ enti@@ ls you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a colour correction , as you will be done during the rough converted .
a profile has been translated into account the color information and instructions how these may be given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ ous ; information such as colour space using a colour space in the other , so the colors are as precisely as possible .
questions , if a picture is opened in image editing , will start / colour management module with rough files .
color profile file you can use the folders such as / usr / share / color / ICC / / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you want to save all of the profiles . &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ing ; these folders then came during the start .
settings of the ICC profiles here you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . all you can change in opening of the raw file later .
the colour management view is an alternative opposite X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your images are not admini@@ str@@ ated by the entire screen .
the input profiles should do not fit into the same type . there are some examples such as Canon which do not contain color mapping or gam@@ ma@@ x@@ correction . at the moment , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma does not contain any conver@@ sions at 16 @-@ bit depth . this means you need to carry out the color mapping themselves .
there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , with which you can print out , as your printer would like to print a smaller color range than your camera and some colours are very saturated . this could be correc@@ ted because of your printer &apos;s blind algorithm .
for most cameras it is quite obvious that colour profile with them is designed for what it is intended . unfortunately , this is a table of cameras and profile . therefore , this is a table of cameras and profile .
the Canon profile extension allows the style to detect : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for neutr@@ ally , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; image plu@@ gin interface . it &apos;s an interface that supports to work from a series of &amp; K@@ DE ; many modules support which were written to work with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if you want to use the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of the available modules . choose from that you want to use and this will be loaded by &amp; digi@@ ous ; these modules appear as a new entries in the menu of the main entrance and in addition , you will find some of the menu on the menu .
short @-@ warran@@ ts for tasks that are conducted by modules in the menu , can be set up in the menu under settings .
for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules , you can use the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins or in the books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ cked on the brightness , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other crossing on the met@@ adata fields , which are attached to the lower end of the images during the display .
the camera features are displayed on the left @-@ hand side . if you want to use the camera , make sure that the camera is connected to the computer and display mode . currently , the port settings are here serial , USB@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage needs .
at the lower end you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ wire @-@ link . this field is only active when you have a USB@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage era . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / near or / m@@ nt / so , specify that your camera switches .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization ; to use , you need to connect the camera with your computer , it will be able to display mode in the display mode .
Pro@@ bi@@ ere gives you whether and digi@@ ous ; the camera automatically recogn@@ ises the camera automatically . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set your camera , your camera appears in the menu .
you can select any any label for your camera . this will be displayed in the menu of the main table . if you have more than one camera , you can add all here .
with the option Ex@@ tension dialog for the insert of &gt; images in the gar@@ dening look , you can set the equ@@ ation of &amp; digi@@ ous ; when you can set the photos of a photos in an album . in the sections of a photos and del@@ eting of an album you will find more details .
the editorial changes in the right side of the right side is shut down through &amp; digi@@ tization ; if you use the option to use changes in the right side of the right side . otherwise you will need to use the changes with the kno@@ b modifications .
you can also read the display of the welcome screen from &amp; digi@@ ous ; in case of sub@@ types , this acceler@@ ates under circumstances take the startup procedure .

different colour schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ tization ; to adapt the main window to your taste . these settings can choose from the tool bar . a preview of the available designs are below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; delivery ; you will find more information about this tut@@ orial .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; you can use a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use this view to view your photos and upgrade . image processing can be started with a click on the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the option , editing and editing .
image processing contains a range of tools to improve your images . some of them stand in &amp; delivery ; these are not part of your distribution . if you are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you will find in the image processing .
a status line at the lower edge of the F@@ enst@@ ers , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current data number , En@@ tran@@ ce factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the upper edge , including the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
the machining functions of image processing will change your photos . however , no functions will change the original photo , before you use the memory or the kno@@ bs from the tool bar . please note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo , as soon as you have stored the picture .
so you should use a copy of your image , before you change it . you can change it with memory .
as long as you have taken the picture , you can connect the original picture to the re @-@ button , using the button , file sharing to the tool bar . then you lose every change that you have taken on the photo since the last memory .
nearly any promotion of image processing can be restored and restored . the last promotion can be restored and restored , by using editing or re@@ produce , by editing the menu .
if you use this often , you should make the keyboard short@@ ened C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to re @-@ end and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ switch @-@ old to re @-@ manufacture .
if you want to press the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the tool bar a moment longer , you get a context menu . if you choose one of the menu plan , all actions will also be restored and restored .
as soon as you have the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word , you can use the files in the menu file . if you do not have any modifications to the latest photo , you &apos;ll want to back up whether you want to back up .
you can also go into the photo and out out in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; Maus@@ rad or the symbols in the tool bar or use the entries in the menu menu .
to adapt to a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool bar : enlarge En@@ forcement factor automatically
view full screen mode the photo in full screen mode . if you do not want to use the tool bar . if you don &apos;t want to change this page dialog , you can change it from the &amp; digi@@ ous ; the main window will be broadcast . see the section to set up the image processing .
if you want to print out the current picture , you can select the files in the menu , and get the Standard &amp; K@@ DE and print dialog . you can adjust the settings you can print your photo before you .
from the main menu , you can print individual pictures or whole sets out of your selection . you need to select the pictures with the default methods and choose from the menu album Export assistant . if you follow the assistant , you need to make your choice just your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; main window is set on the right edge , which provides important information and actions available for selected pictures . the same page is , without the navigation device parts , also available in image processing . it will be displayed when one of the five riders will be charged .
Multi@@ f@@ able cli@@ cks on the same rider lets the page bar set the side down or again in the edge disappear .
in the labelling view , you can use the correct size . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields that you can use other programs to be used .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are formed according to 2000 characters and special characters are formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling in other applications , you should note these restrictions .
after you have comments , you will use either the kno@@ b / or change the next image , which will then be stored .
in addition to the application kno@@ b , there is a button on the selected file or the database . however , you can also write met@@ adata to the files . this is always done if you have a met@@ adata setting , which is always written into the pictures .
the section rating shows a number of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and sorting line . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the page bar . in order to evaluate several pictures at the same time , select the context menu and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field on the IP@@ TC field . coding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
the key@@ word overview shows an search box to filter the key@@ words , the key@@ word and a select box with previously held in this &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; -@@ meeting .
the key@@ word tree is dynamic in the set @-@ contained function . you can easily fit the number of possibilities for a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful if you have a lot of key@@ words .
the input field at the lower end is a further relief when entering the input of key@@ words in a picture series . if you have given different key@@ words , these will be stored for fast access .
key@@ words also can be set by marking of the appropriate check@@ box in the tree . tags of a picture will be stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if several pictures in the main view is selected , and you will select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , and not on the entire selection , If you want to have a selection with a key@@ word , please read the section sample filter .
the page bar code is used to change the selection of the box window . normally , the left side is used with their album , - data , key@@ word and view@@ point . if in addition , a or more sample filters from the right side will be displayed , only the section of these two are displayed . all of them are available .
you can also take advantage of key@@ words , and if the key@@ word is already exists , you can simply pull off the right side of the right side and put on the selection . then a dialogue you asks if you want the key@@ word .
in the upper example shows the main window of the pictures on a cal@@ ender date . they were chosen with Str@@ g + a and then a key@@ word from the right sample of which was pulled to the selection and set there . a dialogue is asked if this key@@ word should be set .
these search for changes will take place in any launch of the program . you can also be switched on with the settings .
if you have a rule with and created , that it should be one or should be , you can easily change it with a double click on the text and control .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is found in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the oper@@ ator , which is a name or a character set , which is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an extension search for all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group@@ ed options , you only need to use the check@@ box at the end of the rule , and then use the button . options can be seen as follows :

this article / tut@@ orial was written primarily by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I &apos;ve used mostly to &amp; digi@@ ous ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you can use a color@@ able workflow from your camera or sc@@ anned colours . colour management can be found that the colors are printed on your monitor or sc@@ anners , and the colours will print you or in the web .
if the theme of color management comes , we would like to say that you would like to find out any background information about color management at any point of the image processing . in addition to this tut@@ orial , you would give you to make your own information on your own decisions you will receive the desired results .
if your image processing is fulfilled all six below criteria , you must not take care of color management .
they work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( further information you will find below )
their only other image editions are by e @-@ mail or the Web , where the RGB of the de @-@ facto standard is .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and the life for all so simple , why should you use another colour space , so you should make thoughts about color@@ imet@@ ric ng ?
a visual example of the RGB is shown in comparison to the colours which we can really see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors , which we can see , the hu@@ fu @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger colour space , you can visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms , please click on info and then on information about the RGB Working Group .
I must set my monitor with my monitor when I decided to work only in the RGB colour space ?
yes ! if you &apos;re working in the RGB @-@ colour space , so it &apos;s not to use your monitor . if you &apos;re working as a color space of s@@ RGB , then you must use either your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard k@@ alli@@ bri@@ s , a suitable monitor profile , or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . use it before you try to try a further manual .
the functions norm@@ alize them , the same , automatic gearbox and contrast , would try to make up the best of your colors . they need to experiment with these effects , to see what the best acts with your photo .
norm@@ alize them : this method does the leu@@ ka@@ emia values over the entire image , so the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point as light as possible without its color sh@@ aded . this function is often common with an error correction for the dark or balanced .
un@@ equal : this method allows the same as flat as flat as flat as flat as possible . in this way , the same results achieved very good results in the contra@@ ction of a picture , sometimes it is only gar@@ bage . it is a very powerful , which causes either wonder@@ s in an image , or it was destroyed .
automatically assemble the color of the red , green and blue channel . they determined the dark and bright border tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels on the entire Hi@@ sto@@ gram area .
contrast , this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ ance of the RGB values of a picture due to the lowest and highest values in the highest possible area and a re@@ ji@@ point of all values in between . this is only visible with balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the White Paper equ@@ ates from &amp; digi@@ ous ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white balance on a photos .
the white correction factor is limited to about 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you can find the white screen equ@@ alizer in rough mode . if you are able to perform the white mode in rough mode , in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities will fall better .
this tool is based on a white @-@ rec@@ ess of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you will start him about the menu entry in white image processing .
the fore@@ head can be adapted to the size . on the left @-@ hand side , the original picture is also adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original whi@@ tish , then it is sufficient to click on the bottom of the window .
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the L@@ umin@@ ate of the Pix@@ um is displayed as vertical line in the hi@@ sto@@ gram .
on the right , a Hi@@ sto@@ gram is very helpful , as soon as you change one parameter . this Hi@@ sto@@ gram is very helpful , but most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ ous values have to choose whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ous .
the contrast of your result depends on shade , satur@@ ation and gamma . the shade , you can improve the shadow details of your photos or stored .
An@@ stat with the above mentioned checks , you should use the color temperature @-@ pi@@ p@@ ette . press the colour on this button and then set up anywhere in the color temperature for the color temperature of the White . this type , temperature and green values are automatically set on this type .
in addition , you can set the white wine on the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the surface indicators increase the colors , if more than one colour channel of the pixel error occurs . you &apos;ll get the combined result in the white image . this is indicated in the preview of a pure indicator , and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons stores as and store exactly this . any setting of the white equ@@ ates you have to store this in a text file , and later again .
the button sequences sets all the filter values back on their standard values and a neutral white @-@ neutral cover . note that even neutral settings are another photo as your original . if you want to store your original image .
you can adjust the co@@ di@@ zation depth per colour channel of the revised image . 8 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . these coding requires even more record field , data eit , and is available for the PN@@ G , PN@@ M , T@@ IFF and DN@@ G formats .
this tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of paint pictures . it uses the amend@@ ment and the assignment of color profiles . a detailed manual for the use of color profiles can be found in the chapter color management .
another important tool is available in the menu under color correction at the same time . this tool allows you to make sure that your camera or your scanner always need the same error and therefore you will always need the same correction . in the manual for tape correction , you will find further information .
a very powerful possibility of exposure problems is the tool to gra@@ dation , that you find in a menu of Gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool Far@@ be@@ ff@@ effects provides you four colour effects , a solar control effect , a Vel@@ via filter , an ne@@ on effect and an edge filter at your disposal .
in times of the chemical processing industry , Solar@@ is also called the effect of a short flash plate . this was the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas were dark@@ er and the colours were detected by the second illumination . this tool was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity of the solar panels . at about 50 % intensity shows the picture of the che@@ mically possible . an additional increase was to be a negative picture , so not on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar control panel . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processes ( 2 ) . applied intensity lies at 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation that he has a stronger contrast effect has the colors , and bli@@ stering makes . try it simply , it is more comfortable .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on daylight @-@ optimised color vision of the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ vi@@ as has strongly saturated colors but also some phot@@ ograph@@ ers , especially those who hardly have landscapes , too much .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates Ne@@ on@@ light to the contrast . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the shooting down the strength of the Ne@@ on@@ lich@@ s . at large pictures the filter can hold the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras have often correct problems with light conditions and it &apos;s not unusual to change the color contrast of your photos . all your alignment can be viewed in the menu . as soon as you are satisfied with the result , you can use the button on the button and you will be applied .
if you have a picture at bad light conditions , you can get a good choice for brightness / satur@@ ation . even in this case you can look at your satur@@ ation . all changes you can look at the preview . if Him like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
contrast to the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / Gamma is a tool @-@ correction for improving exposure . even if the dialogue is very complicated in this tool , you need to check out the case for use of the shooting . concrete the three shooting below the hi@@ sto@@ l .
the window contains a Graph@@ s of intensity values , a hi@@ sto@@ gram , the active edge as well as the selected range . under the graph@@ s , three cab@@ s can change to change the image values to change the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas .
the easi@@ est way to learn the operation is the regulator to move , and to pay attention how the picture changes .
on the right , the original and preview of the image can be viewed as a preview of the image is dynami@@ cally , using the settings of the image , updated on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling with this selection box can be displayed whether the hi@@ sto@@ gram has a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . if the large areas include a constant color , the linear Hi@@ sto@@ gram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic organization is useful .
three regul@@ ates : the top for the dark sounds , the average for light notes , the lower tones for the middle sounds , often gamma values are called .
the three colour pin@@ p@@ ettes can be used in the preview of the original file , to adjust the input of the shade , middle and light notes automatically . furthermore , there is a button for automatic alignment .
the entries allow you to modify the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ating systems , e.g. the compression of the outputs can be used as a background to create a little picture as a background to something different in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : with this button , image values will automatically set automatically on the image values of the image .
save and store : with these buttons , the selected values in the fil@@ esystem can be saved and later again . furthermore , the Gim@@ p levels is used .
when you use these mode and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes , you want to use them for all shade , funds , and Sundays . click on the preview of the original file for rot@@ ational , green , blue and flash channels .
the option covers all colour channels to find all colour channels , to find the combined result of all channels . this is a indicator , that is , you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result .
below you can see an example of the alignment of the input in red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha @-@ channel , as well as the outputs are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted image ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the origin@@ als and the target picture is indicated . the preview is dynamic on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modifications : this selection box allows the channel to specify the channel by the module :
in addition to this cheese , two symbols have been taken to change between a linear and log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . the linear mode of the linear mode of a constant color , the linear mode also generates a wide beams . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move into a cur@@ v@@ eil into right , for example the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds can be dark with dark@@ er ob@@ liter@@ al cor@@ als , and that they are dark@@ er dark@@ er .
on the preview of the original photos show a red mark on the corner . if you change this mark on the curve that will change the original value . create a point on this line and move the value up to your taste .
store and shop : with these buttons , you can make it exactly . each curve you can use this file system and later will be loaded in the fil@@ esystem . the file format is the Gim@@ p Kur@@ ven@@ format .
when you create these method and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes , you want to use the curve for all channels of the shadow , Central and Sundays . click the original picture to set the control points for the Rot@@ - , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ance curve .
the option is controlled by an indication of the color channels . if in more than one channel , you will receive the combined result . this is a indicator , that is , you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo , which was fixed in the L@@ umin@@ ous canal with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and mounted on the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and correc@@ ted ( 2 ) .
the channel mix@@ ers of the digi@@ tization ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or changing the color of the photos .
the channel mixer is another high @-@ designed tool to blend the color shades of the images . you can work in the menu colours channel @-@ Mixer of image processing .
with the channel @-@ resistant box , you can choose the color to the hi@@ sto@@ gram , allowing you to correct the channels using the relative distribution and rash . the left @-@ section of the F@@ enst@@ ers shows you a preview of The original can be seen as a comparison on his own riders .
the preview of the target group has a red marker . if you appear in the picture position , vertical line appears in the hi@@ sto@@ gram to give you the appropriate color .
the controls are on the right below : if you change the appropriate color components , and if you change the appropriate color components , the channel bl@@ ender will then change the option to generate great black @-@ and conver@@ sions of your photos . try the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you want Mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a colour to a visible part of the colour space . however , if that &apos;s the case you can use your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion so you can improve the colour space at first .
the memory used as and store buttons are exactly to this purpose . any other mix@@ ers can be used to store and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option covers all colour channels to find all colour channels , to find the combined result of all channels . this is a indicator , that is , you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a picture in the blue Channel . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the be@@ ware image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstract ability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is always able to convert colour images simply on the computer . also with a set of film rolling profiles .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford , 4 Plus , Il@@ ford FP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford &apos;s X@@ P2 Super
green filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lin@@ t filter . this looks good , with all the scen@@ ographic images and paired particularly well in portrait against the sky . thus , similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filters .
orange filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a orange filter filter . this improved landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . thus , like the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) or@@ ised filters .
red filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film screen with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic heaven effects and can simul@@ ate moon phases to the day . therefore , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ Filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural colour correction and improved the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and with similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm light and medium sounds while he is a bit cold in the sc@@ atter@@ ing of a Dru@@ cks and the re @-@ development of a s@@ epi@@ ece . this is typical of the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding an texture to your image , whether it &apos;s a color picture on a screen , a pop music portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry image can be used on image processing .
relief : postp@@ one this parameter to the right increases the pressure of the depth or three dimensional of texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tured image is applied on the picture below . the original image is shown ( 1 ) and changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been on 200 .
first , a decorative frame can be added with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool frame can be added to a decorative frame .
the eye of an amount of interest in the boundaries of a photos is not easy task . it &apos;s a psychological barrier to watch the eye . this is a psychological barrier for the remote eye . under the image , the module can be launched from image processing .
type : with this parameter , the picture with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce leaves it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white images ) , sh@@ kant@@ et it is ideal for a push @-@ dimensional effect and decor@@ ate a ornamental frame with a patterns .
width : is the width of the frame in percent . the value area is limited to 1 % to 50 % .
this is also bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio is greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the pressure of images , especially if you have used the tool to cut the aspect ratio previously .
with this practical tool , you can add simple a form@@ att@@ ed text in a picture at any time . this is also possible to multiple occasions if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . use the text and place it with the mouse . if you need to adjust the character set , the character must be bigger , the character must be greater part of the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
each setup , which you have changed for your text , can be changed to the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the image was saved once , the text is part of the picture . it can &apos;t be changed anymore .
by the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool templ@@ ates you can use a templ@@ ates on a picture .
the menu picture Sch@@ abl@@ one can be used in image processing , to put templ@@ ates on a picture .
if you don &apos;t have any restrictions on the size of the template &apos;s size . if you want to add your templ@@ ates ( 9 ) to use the PN@@ G file format and you simply send an e @-@ mail to the &amp; digi@@ ous ; mail@@ ing list of the digi@@ ti@@ ff @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool to use the button , you have to set your template file with the button . select the file into the template . select the files in the box files . these settings will be added to the next start .
after the root @-@ makers for the templ@@ ates has been re @-@ reflected a building view , which is re@@ marked by the template &apos;s office structure . the selection of a folders updated the templ@@ ates of templ@@ ates .
below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the En@@ tran@@ ce factor and change the position of your image .
enlarge : this button increases the opposite picture . it is set to re@@ ed the mouse position . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ inks the mouse button . if you want to use the mouse button , if you want the template to use the mouse . if you want the template for the whole picture , you &apos;ll have to use the image according to the left . check it with the left mouse button .
postp@@ one : do not use this button to move under the template . let &apos;s see the picture and place it in the desired position .
use OK if you want the templ@@ ates on your picture . the image will be adapted to the fore@@ front @-@ size .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ came ; provides three different tool to sharp@@ ening the sharp@@ ness . each of you has the advantages in other areas .
spicy is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening of sharp@@ ness . it is very fast and easy to produce , but especially in dark fields , approved images .
un@@ parall@@ eled mask @-@ mask works on the contrast of the edge to look back . indeed , it is not able to remove atmospheric Dun@@ es , making it a really good job . the algorithm was taken out of Gim@@ p and he is protected by Winston Chang .
re@@ focus is probably the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little complicated in his application and has different parameters to customi@@ zation .
photos without focus as well as most dig@@ ging images need to install a common color . this is the same phenomenon that sharp edges can be printed on paper if color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras require more usually using normal cameras for the private use .
in JPEG images , a camera of internal sharp@@ ening can be applied . photos in the size of the same size , they must always be welded in during the processing .
some sc@@ anners are using a sharp@@ ening agent already during the image of the image . if you activate this de@@ dis@@ able , you will receive control over your image .
in some situations you can need usable results by using a photograph with sharp@@ ening of sharp@@ ness of sharp@@ ness . you can call with the menu entry into conducting sharp@@ ness .
should not be careful , however , the sharp@@ ness of counter@@ ing the edge of the edges , but also increases the tool . in general , you can focus about the menu entry into conducting re@@ focus . among the focus , you will find further information and comparison of all techniques to the sharp@@ ness .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p@@ y . use the tool to toler@@ ate with the menu entry , and experim@@ ented with settings . the fore@@ front page on the right side of the di@@ alo@@ ges shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp m@@ asked is a very good tool to remove v@@ eil of your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original picture and preview the image can view the image and view the image of the fil@@ ly with the latest settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . standard values generate often good results and should be at first . an increase in the amount of radius will make the effect . if you make the imp@@ act@@ fe mask to do , smoking and create the impression of Gr@@ aten in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius is like many pixels on each side of a edge by the filter are affected . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radios . you should therefore play images at the best in its final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the ench@@ anted picture of the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the limit value is a split from the maximum RGB value and the amount of difference . you can use a minimum difference for the filter . however , these areas are avoided with a soft change between the killing of stri@@ pes and therefore Schön@@ united errors in remedi@@ es , Himm@@ ler and water surfaces avoided .
this is an example of un@@ sharp m@@ asked filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the image was used ( 2 ) . sharp m@@ asked with a radius of = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool re@@ focus is focusing on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the protected protected filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool is trying to give a photo to &amp; quot ; it is better to give it a photo called &quot; F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ ters . &quot; this is a better result of using the un@@ break@@ er @-@ mask . re@@ focus is mostly better results than un@@ sharp m@@ asked . you can start playing in the menu by using colors Re@@ focus on the image processing .
in practice , the circular case has a very long tail , which leads far from the source pix@@ . in most cases , the F@@ IR Vienna In@@ verse of Gau@@ ß &apos; is likely to be influenced by the most cases , so much more strongly influenced by the distant pixels . however , undes@@ i@@ rable results were caused .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the main parameter for the module file . it is the most important parameter to use this module . for most images if your picture should amount to 1 good results . you can put a higher level if your image is very un@@ sharp , but then it should be paid for holy .
correlation is possible to reduce the correlation . the correlation can be selected from 0 to 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation is reduced to the module &apos;s effect .
noise filters can help to reduce it by 0 @-@ 1 . however , values above 0 @-@ 1 is much helpful . however , the image quality is very poor . however , the image quality is very po@@ or@@ ly . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value , the image becomes even more suscep@@ tible .
Gau@@ ß &apos; sharp@@ ness : this is the most frequent cause of the palate . if you do not use this value to 0 . if you do not use this value to zero if you use a value of zero , you may have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
mat size : this value is determined by the size of the transformation size , especially if you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos; . note that the module is very slow when you choose large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the memory used as and store buttons are exactly to this purpose . each of any re@@ focus parameters will have set it to be stored for later and then can be charged then .
try all modul@@ us , color and intensity rec@@ ir@@ tures on the picture before you use the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image , before you change the image . for this reason , there is that a lot of operations are not visible immediately , but later added to un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read pictures and compressed , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should use the module to the un@@ compressed picture .
in general , Un@@ sharp m@@ asked better outcomes than sharp@@ ening of sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by sharp m@@ ring a bigger neighborhood as sharp@@ ening of sharp@@ ness .
theore@@ tically , it has to remove the impact of the un@@ spo@@ ilt filter . even under the optimal conditions it is possible that it is the result of the F@@ IR Viennese Fil@@ ters always at least as well as the un@@ parall@@ eled mask . the F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ ters is often better for processing of small details .
below , you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focusing image , see :
the original un@@ clear colour image can be correc@@ ted . this picture was done with an analog camera . the in@@ focusing result is due to sufficient light for the Auto @-@ Focus Lin@@ se .
for more information about the methods to sharp@@ ening methods in digital images you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the regulator G@@ ink@@ ed puts the ir@@ cul@@ ation of the range which was dark@@ ened to create a natural p@@ up@@ ill .
the color tin@@ ent allows the adapted color for the p@@ up@@ ill . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set this here .
the tool screens is one of the most extensive tool to remove it with an unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different fre@@ eware tasks as a starter points to make the restoration . the available Vo@@ ices are below :
if you want to mount the filter settings , you can use the Reiter G@@ etting and Advanced Settings .
details : p &#91; 0 &#93; , 100 &#93; : this is controlled by the details of the details . a value of 0.9 should be able to smooth surface and details . a value of 0.9 should not be retro@@ fit . please note that , please refer to the details of the details .
alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value of it ev@@ enly into all directions , while a value of 1 can only be used in one direction . if you have a film option or CCD room , JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts will be evaluated at a value close to 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 &#93; , 500 &#93; : this is the maximum G@@ lä@@ se factor via all@@ es. p , then the relative moisture control . put this value therefore suitable to the degree of noise in your picture .
regul@@ ality : &#91; 0 &#93; , 100 &#93; This parameter is specified . this is necessary to estimate the geometry of the image , it &apos;s difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ letin , it must be higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : are often run on how often the algorithm is run . usually , here 1 or 2 is shown here .
angle gradu@@ al angle &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if alpha is small , it should be too small . be sure that small angle create a long term . so you should choose this value as well as for your needs acceptable .
integ@@ rators box &#91; 0.1 , 10 &#93; : integ@@ rates pac@@ emaker in pixel . you should avoid the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel @-@ absor@@ bing and never be larger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more to quality you get through the choice of this option is only low . it doubled the run@@ time . we recommend it to allow him .
the buttons stores as and store exactly this . any setting of image errors can be re@@ written in a text file , and then be loaded later .
image errors is compar@@ atively very quickly with the work . however , it can still take a long last long and a high CPU last time . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
below , you can see how picture errors can be correc@@ ted with an analog camera . as you can see , there is a distinctive black film in the fore@@ ground that caused by a bad film storage during the journey . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; Rau@@ es , is a highly powerful tool to reduce noise levels . it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ el .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters for example , to remove spots and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor r@@ ents from the camera or mo@@ re@@ counts ; effects of inj@@ ected images from books and magazines .
if you need more information about sensor r@@ hin@@ ts of digital cameras , you can read these on English in this tut@@ orial .
the screen photo above shows a typical scene connected to a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a liqu@@ e@@ worthy Rau@@ schen , which can be successfully completed with this tool .
in the following cases , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you need only the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window settings can remain at the default settings .
radius , the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 41@@ x@@ 41 ) is required for the filter . large values improve / pixel . due to the radius , the image can be moved over the picture and the color into him will be polished and therefore smaller flaws will be adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the filter distance to the front , and if it is increased , you will need to change the edges . if the value is too high , if you change this adjustment . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image may not be preserved and wrought more accurately .
edges : controls the edge precision for the sharp@@ ness . if he is strong , the frequency response can be removed or to @-@ s@@ cou@@ ts . put it on a value close to the maximum , if you want to remove a smoking , or JPEG , if you want to lose some details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ous tolerance of the image . we recommend using either color or lumin@@ ance , to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the G@@ lä@@ tt@@ le process which will be controlled by details -@@ settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance , to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the G@@ lä@@ tt@@ le process which will be controlled by details -@@ settings .
gamma : controls the gamma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase tolerance values of the dark@@ er ranges which typically consume stronger , however , the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : if it increases the adaptive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if he is increased , the can@@ es will be able to occur when it can occur on his minimum , smoking and phase j@@ itter to appear on the edges . it can be used to remove noise and is the recommended method for this .
store and shop : these buttons are exactly used for making it . all parameters for smokers , which you have set up , can be stored in the fil@@ esystem , and later charged .
this is an example of how smokers can change your life . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted ( 2 ) . the bar has been used with the default settings .
sometimes it is a picture of cris@@ p@@ y for your purpose . use the tool to define a bit soft as a picture . use the menu with the menu entry , and experim@@ ented with the g@@ ask@@ et . the fore@@ head on the right side of the di@@ alo@@ es shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools in photography of photographs .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unbe@@ atable part of your images . it &apos;s very well @-@ adapted to remove the images displayed in digital , original or subsequent digi@@ tised images , removing leaves and receives the content such as the human eye as the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for colour and tex@@ turing . the algorith@@ ms is carried out with a different tool consisting of the IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
JPEG arti@@ facts : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . when a loss of compression was produced . it creates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - a small standard set out in the un@@ compressed picture . this setting is to correct this problems .
the buttons stores as and store exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file , and then re@@ loaded later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very quickly with the work . however , it can still take a long last long and a high CPU last time . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button .
below , you can reduce the not@@ orious film ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can recognize the not@@ orious movie approved on the core . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted below ( 2 ) .
below , you can see a further example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures was applied to an old colour photo , which was used by sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the phot@@ op@@ aper paper . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ch ; tool Hot@@ pixel , it allows to remove hot@@ pixel of photos which have been fitted with an CCD camera , eight of them were removed . it uses algorith@@ ms from J@@ P@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly with high @-@ quality raw mode pictures , as many cameras with JPEG compression over a built @-@ in oppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ um quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ um quot ; on a picture with a dark picture sub@@ tra@@ items . there is no manual method to select the poor pixels .
this file into the assistant with the button dark . the tool is automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are produced in the picture show .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to discover the dark picture directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels due to CCD defects .
first , as in the previous section , you should load the matching dark picture to the clear picture . an automatic processing of the dark images will be the bad pixel . note that the assistant to the last dark shows , and this automatically invites you to the next session at the next session .
the image and the image can help you back within the image . the fore@@ sh@@ avers shows the copy of the fil@@ ly with the latest settings . poor pixels are out in all stock areas .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels in the preview and the results of the filter . choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pixels blocks . these are the available filter :
Dur@@ ation : it is identified as an average of the neighbouring pixel . the resulting colour is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels per block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation it will be done separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all Pix@@ um that have a distance from 1 of the pixel block ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective pixels in block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to Pix@@ el@@ block are pulled to calculate an bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are pulled out to calculate an bi @-@ Cuban surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cuban curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction for a color photo , out of a def@@ ective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , used . the original image was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; Vign@@ et@@ ination correction is a tool to correct the Vign@@ et@@ able , i.e. under@@ scores corners , a picture .
wide @-@ angle objects , especially which in the middle and large photo format , can be found in the middle and large photo format . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ able quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) they could reduce the edges and edges of the image by putting the light to the sensor . tel@@ e@@ objects can also show this behavior under circumstances .
but it has also cons . many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the stop @-@ stop filters so that it is impossible to keep the camera with hand . wide @-@ angle objects should also be able to use center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ tigh@@ tened effects arise .
with the large exposure of today &apos;s film and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter . the transformation with a Cent@@ er@@ filter is applied to an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three shelves , you can control the Vign@@ et@@ ination correction file , and with three other the exposure of the target .
density : this parameter is controlled by the largest density of filters . the default density is 2.0 , or random@@ ly a lumin@@ ous thickness of 1 , or random@@ ly a lumin@@ ous thickness of 2 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate the density by a larger degree of Vign@@ ale .
leu@@ cine , contrast , gamma @-@ settings : editing a picture with the correct weight loss . you need to adjust the exposure of the target with these options . the pressure provides you only positive values , as you have to increase the settings .
if you want a hos@@ tile @-@ adjust of exposure to the target , you can use the values / contrast / gamma at zero and use the Gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing from the menu of Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vign@@ et@@ ination correction for a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the image to the corners and ( 2 ) the correc@@ ted image . a lumin@@ ance and contrast correction was also performed at the image with this tool .
the &amp; delivery came ; Lin@@ sen@@ di@@ stortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric di@@ stortion . non @-@ inher@@ itable di@@ stortion can &apos;t be correc@@ ted with this tool .
the coefficient of the second Gra@@ des treats the general geomet@@ rical di@@ stortion of the lens and can be correc@@ ted the con@@ cave or con@@ form of the image .
the coefficient of the third Gra@@ des has a similar circular effect , fla@@ x@@ ed down to the edges . this correction is not used in the tool .
the coefficient can be adjusted from the corners to the second gra@@ des . if you can combine these two shapes , every geomet@@ rical adher@@ es can be eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of the second Gra@@ des . with negative values can be correc@@ ted and adjusted positive values .
corner : this value controls the strength of the di@@ stortion parameter as in the middle of the picture . for most l@@ enti@@ ls it has the corners parameter , the parameter to the parameter &apos;s parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the picture size and performs a correction of the first gra@@ des through . negative values increase in positive the picture .
bright : this value increases the brightness of the picture of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the picture in the corners , while positive values are increasing .
to help you find the best filter settings , you can illustrate the seal with a preview of correction , you will be stored for your picture , stored and when the next start will be used as standard values .
the ton@@ s. or cold @-@ shaped correction should be carried out in front of all modul@@ us or size changes . if you want to cut out this correction than all the first . if you have a picture of the picture , and then it would like to carry out a picture @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent .
to give you the best correc@@ ts you can see it . move the mouse button to be fixed in your picture and press the left mouse button to be fixed at this point . in the connection , you can correct the ton@@ holes / k@@ is@@ al di@@ stortion with the help of the lines .
if you have a k@@ is@@ al di@@ stortion parameter , the resulting image of black corners is trans@@ verse . you can remove these with the cutting tools in the menu , remove from image editing or using the zoom regulator to this Di@@ alo@@ gs .
for most pictures the ton@@ hole @-@ shaped correction is sufficient for some motifs , such as recordings from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective in the picture 90 degrees . please note that when you keep the camera with the hand , you will always have a slight dip in the perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ sils on a church in Norway . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website . filter is produced by the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the foot you can select the area for the preview . if you select the red @-@ rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can consider the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview , you can simul@@ ate two parameters of film projections and film @-@ sensitive film . the ISO regul@@ ates the amount of film and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filters color channels are mis@@ sive with infrared film , especially the green , makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs because the colour is missing .
this is an example of the inf@@ ra @-@ fil@@ me@@ ager for a landscape photograph of New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the image was set up under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of A@@ ura in the hair@@ line .
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to produce films on your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films like the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , known for the sensitivity of the films , and the manufacturers of great silver medal at the photo emul@@ sion .
the approved image effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move into the past . if you want to get out this special , gallery @-@ like , street phot@@ ogra@@ fic@@ al , gra@@ ining sight specially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
with the regulator is calibr@@ ated the ISO @-@ sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the body . the default value is , even higher values are needed to apply ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more body , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the approved n@@ os@@ tic effect on a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the be@@ acon ( 2 ) . the used film contains ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it is used to create a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice appearance , like an oil paintings . nature pictures and styles are good for this effect .
there are two regulator to affect this effect . the upper cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brush are better for great pictures . smooth the leaves , or , from the other hand side of the hin@@ ge .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the be@@ acon is marked with the ( 2 ) . pin@@ out size is 1 and G@@ ink@@ te 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zer ; filter coal drawing is used in drawing colour and hence they are not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful to imagine that scene you would like to have the scene you would like to catch up . this would be good pictures to catch up .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ bs select the bottom size from and the bottom adjust the contrast ( G@@ ink@@ te ) .
this is an example of the carbon @-@ filter filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the altered picture ( 2 ) . the standard settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result is further improved by adjusting the intensity of intensity .
the &amp; delivery came ; filters engraving with your image in 3 @-@ D , when it was marked in wax . it has been used to create a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ur ; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your images with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important content of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity , to turn the image into a gray , common landscape .
the depth allows the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , the default setting is .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the be@@ ware image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group , you can create a normal photo into an artwork by using disp@@ ers@@ al effects . it is used to use the protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : shares the picture in cells , and leaves it , as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analo@@ g@@ ous to the wavelength 1 the image is broken here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time for calcul@@ ating and generate a high CPU load . you can break this effects at any time using the button .
with this filter group , you can create a normal photo in an artwork by means of in@@ fusion effects . it is used to transform it @-@ protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom un@@ shar@@ k : don &apos;t know the picture along the stern@@ as lines out of a focus . this simul@@ ates the un@@ spo@@ ilt camera and generates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ al Un@@ ity : don &apos;t know the image by turning of the pixel , to a focus . this simul@@ ates the in@@ fusion of a rotating camera .
removal of removal : don &apos;t know the image to generate a non @-@ focuss@@ ing camera . the object seems to come back into the background .
motion un@@ parall@@ eled : don &apos;t know the image due to horizontal mo@@ tions of pixels . this simul@@ ates the in@@ fusion of an linear , z : B : by a car or train fotografi@@ a , camera .
soft touch : it gives the picture of soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates pictures of a portrait and a smooth focuss@@ ing effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or to add a warm and subtle gl@@ ar .
cont@@ amin@@ ant : don &apos;t know the image by random deportation of pixel , and simul@@ ates the in@@ fusion of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent Un@@ ity : finds the colour basin in the picture and let them need to change these without the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the picture in rectangular cells and created it , by the filling with an average pixel value .
some effects need a long time for calcul@@ ating and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time using the button .
the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es are a nice small tool to make Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your picture . thus , it gives the natural your images a bare look . it uses a pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n ur@@ he@@ ber@@ legally protected algorithm .
dri@@ p size does not allow the size of the size of size . as the dri@@ p size is not necessary to reduce the size of small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect on the image .
you can stick with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image editing a range of Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es . do not use the selection , for example a face to stay freely . if you start the filter Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es , the range will remain in the area .
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset on the picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset on a storm . the standard values have been used for this example .
if the photo is the wrong orientation , so you can find it through spi@@ ke or spin into the right orientation . the tools can be trans@@ forming out in the menu of trans@@ forming thresh@@ ing or trans@@ forming side .
photo shoot is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo to enlarge with a minimum loss of image quality .
the great question is simple , as you can stick to a picture , as you can reach the limits of the resolution ? how can you see the lack of information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm is used here , making a good work . try him and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size , you can change it to the desired size with the tool size , select trans@@ forming size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialogue is below .
the tool to size , uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to handle the pixels . if you want a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to bub@@ bles .
many image programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge The picture . the underlying algorithm picture was developed by the IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you don &apos;t need to change the tool such as you want to change size . these settings are available in the riders and below are below :
aspect ratio : if this setup is activated , the input of the new size will retain the aspect ratio of the original size .
regul@@ ality : &#91; 0 &#93; , 100 &#93; This parameter is specified . this is necessary to estimate the geometry of the image , it &apos;s difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ enz@@ en@@ eff@@ et , it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons can be used as and store exactly . each in@@ feed for photography can be saved as a text file and later again .
photo v@@ ens is very fast at what it makes , but it can still take a long last long and a high CPU last time . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button .
you can see below an example of a picture of a picture above , by a small color picture on the double size . the original ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) is the result of a linear binding enlargement .
the assignment of a photo is not just a common type of operation , but also a common tool to cover a picture . in order to cover a picture with the mouse , pressing the mouse button and draw the rect@@ angle , you &apos;ll see this rect@@ angle and move the mouse .
when you want to get the mouse button , you will get a good overview as your photo to the cut . thus , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by using the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle create by simply with the left mouse button .
as soon as you are satisfied with the cutting edge of the picture kno@@ b to the tool bar and photo is cut off ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries in memory or file memory under the menu file to store the new cut photo .
in the building area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by setting the corners of the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you have defined in the dialogue , you will receive .
in the tool after aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the larger value of height and cross @-@ format is assigned .
depending on the aspect ratio , this means a relative aspect ratio . this means that it &apos;s always like if you use centi@@ meters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the Di@@ alo@@ es , two buttons exist to extend the range of horizont@@ ally horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
below the dialogue you can end up with the Max . ratio kno@@ cked to the area for the maximum possible level , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool After aspect ratio ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are stored as standard values in depending on the orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will be re@@ adapted to the cut picture , and not the original picture .
the settings of the integration aid allow assistance to the help to put your images better , so that you can also make your images better :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic sub@@ species are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ party , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are one of the possibility to divide it in a similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal .
golden center : the golden middle is a division that offers a split of different natural growth , such as the spiral of a Nauti@@ lus mus@@ sels or ble@@ bs of a sunflower . it is available in all possible things that we see as beautiful .
the gold division is the ir@@ ration@@ ale number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you were used by the old Egyptians and Greeks designed to design the gold division in all times when you use your images , buildings and even photos put together to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is directed by Fi@@ bon@@ acci episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where any number one after 1 is equal to 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition of this rule will be seen as a visual harmon@@ ic .
the golden middle is liquid relief lines at your disposal if you put together a painting . this can be counted below :
the Golden Spir@@ ale will get to get closer to your photos . in comparison to the third @-@ party , the Golden Spir@@ ale can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition runs the view of the viewer along the line of spiral and aimed at this kind a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
another rule are the right corner of the golden spiral , too . it should be something that the eye can be at heart of the composition . that can be a line , or different objects . this can be just because of the eye , it &apos;s easy to carry out his task .
the Golden tri@@ angles are also directed by the sides of the sides of the golden tones . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no longer tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal can be found on these lines .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame in order to break your frame . try your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that can &apos;t be different .
the options Horiz@@ ont@@ al mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic partition .
with the button , you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . on this type , you can adjust the color of your current image .
the Free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate a picture by any angles .
if you do a picture , then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera to stick or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things can repair your digi@@ tization ; image editing , and the tool free press . select trans@@ forming free web press and adjust the target angle .
rot@@ ate your picture with the shooting angle . the values can set up to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation can be set to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the rear side . the new dimensions of the image will be displayed above .
to your help you &apos;ll find a horizontal and vertical line at your disposal . after taking over an important point of the image , you can fixed him with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after passing a picture , they will be able to find an unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one possibility to repair this function is the function trans@@ forming cutting of image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture to cut the picture . choose one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing smooth the picture a bit after turning . please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ an trans@@ formations are carried out to a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to change the red quad@@ rate at the corners of your image . the preview will then be re@@ charged automatically . on the right side of the di@@ alo@@ ges , you will find some information about the perspective :
new width : the width of the new image , including the empty areas were created by the transformation through the transformation .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas made by the transformation through the transformation .
angle left above : shows the current angle in degrees in the upper left corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees in the upper right corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angles right below : shows the current angle in degrees in the lower right corner of the trans@@ forming area .
after adjusting the perspective the image becomes a little bit . for one single customi@@ zation , this effect is small but two adap@@ ts generate a double @-@ strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after the perspective , they get un@@ joy@@ ful holes at the corners . one possibility of this is to be able to cut the image with trans@@ forming cutting edge from the image processing .
the switch is used to postp@@ one part of the image to the right and the other part to the right . this is no rotation , the picture will be broken . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogra@@ m . you can start this module about trans@@ forms .
check your image by using the Horiz@@ ont@@ al angle and vertical angle . you can press the angle to zero and will be reset to zero . a preview of the Eff@@ ects will show you and the new dimensions of the target will be displayed on the right .
to your help get a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to a key point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to be fixed the lines . you can now use the switch tool to adjust your image .
after you have carried out the image , the image will be dis@@ rup@@ ted , however , for one single lubri@@ cation , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two spra@@ ys , as much as the devast@@ ation and hence should avoid this .
after the lubri@@ cation , the image has an impressive tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one possibility to eliminate the image with trans@@ forming cutting edge from the image processing .
&amp; delivery came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages . therefore , the formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way such as such libraries are comp@@ iling . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ tization .
due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give them a list of all your system file formats . however , you &apos;ll always find JPEG and T@@ IFF .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; only files in formats used to know . this is done using the file extension and a look at the list . if the extension is displayed in image processing . you can select this list of file extensions to the digi@@ ti@@ dings . you can change other information on this configuration . in the section you can find further information .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IFF . some cameras allow you to select the format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; check out both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there is better , smooth results as JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save loss @-@ free if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw format you can read on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge . you can convert rough images in JPEG or T@@ IFF . in the section of configuration , you can find further information about the modules of modules with &amp; digi@@ ous ;
&amp; delivery came ; the shop of rough pictures only supported by the program d@@ cra@@ w , which can be seen in &amp; digi@@ ous ; all cameras can be seen below the Web page of Dave coff@@ in . see table below shows a short list of raw material used by &amp; delivery ;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . but if you want to display a film file . if you click on a film file and click &amp; digi@@ tization ; the &amp; K@@ DE will take advantage of the reproduction to play the program for playback .

&amp; graphic design ; graph@@ s are free layout programme for viewing and computer programs . until now , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; -@@ program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s and graphic programs , according to the programme author , dated &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ k ; -@@ programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; -@@ Project has set itself the target to replace these programs through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical user interface with all the functions of an integrated &amp; K@@ DE program .
&amp; k@@ graphic viewer : a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ graph@@ s ; -@@ graphic programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s featuring all the possibilities of a good integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; programme in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( such that a change in Graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; the Graph@@ s will be re @-@ adjusted and in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer . )
menu to open the Graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; up to open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; in a &amp; Kate group ;
a big Graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from about 1000 kn@@ ots and one h@@ ack to get more than this kn@@ ots )
more needed software : &amp; k@@ graphic viewer : is a &amp; K@@ DE ; programme , which the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of the graphite process are needed .
the main window display shows the opening window , each in a private window . at the beginning , when you want to open the tool@@ box empty as in the lower screen photo . in this case , the tool file contains only the symbol file and open the files saved files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have chosen one or more &amp; dot ; -@@ files have selected , the main window is set out as in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , an overview in the corner if Gra@@ ph is bigger than the drawing space . you can choose a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
the mouse wheel use ( high and r@@ under without special ta@@ unt , left and right at covered &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming can be limited in both directions through a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a Graph@@ s .
if the straight in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; invited file from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Gra@@ ph will be re@@ charged , or if you want to ignore a change , or if you want to change your decision , so you may change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings . you can use the menu item settings .
if you want to open a Graph@@ end@@ at@@ ei outside of an ongoing &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; if you want to open the command station , whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; -@@ instance , or want to open up to lad@@ ling Graph@@ s in a sub@@ window of the case already .
as in the last option you can save your choice , but this also allows you to change with the setup dialog .
when you start your last session , you can return all the Graph@@ s of your last session . once again , you can save your choice as well as later .
you can also define , how the Gra@@ ph is split to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ s will be ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio is ignored . if you fill the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the Graph@@ s .
side view with one on several pages , graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
the page of Renewable , gives the possibility to change the behavior if a file is changed on the hard disk . you can specify a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ load or changes to ignore ) or the program each time .
the side is possible to open the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer . you can specify a standard behavior for this case ( the Graph@@ s in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the current session ) or determine that every time is required .
the site of the administration is the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer . you can specify a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine the files for each start .
the context menu , which normally occurs at one click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opened further options :
here you can choose from different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ er@@ algorith@@ ms . entries , as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are :

the K@@ IP@@ I Module Pictures will be able to read tools for new images to be added and this sc@@ atter@@ ing .
this module can be used to be added to new pictures in external sources , and you can use two sources :
sc@@ anned images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner of scanner through the S@@ ane Project or any other source , e.g. video streams . that &apos;s this , you will need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and S@@ ane installed .
if you &apos;re talking about the menu entry images , a dialogue , which you can choose between all available sources on your computer . choose the source from which you want to pick up the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window allows you to select the default value of your needs to choose your image , before you read the button . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information .

once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and the conver@@ sions result . JPEG uses a loss of loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged image format , T@@ IFF , keeps all of your image and use the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you &apos;re looking forward to edit your images or later , you should not use the JPEG format because there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality deteri@@ or@@ ated . T@@ IFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose to select the met@@ adata with the RA@@ W file in the RA@@ W file , the JPEG file is stored in the Ex@@ if information .
if you are adapted to your settings , you can start with the conversion button . if you want to break this process , you can break this process .

&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can create two options available HTML websites with your images . one can be integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated in the following section of the user interface , integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version described via the menu ( HTML file ) .
before HTML @-@ pages you will need some settings : these are divided into the three areas of contents , layout and goal . in the following , each section will be described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the over@@ cks and a description , which may contain the HTML file later . click on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example @-@ pages see an example for this settings .
next , choose from whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file , should be created on the map page . nutrients can find information about the export files .
last , you can choose which information on the HTML pages are supposed to be selected . for example , you can &apos;t make sure that all pictures are exported . you can &apos;t use all the pictures . you can &apos;t use this setting , so that you can &apos;t use certain images before certain amount of amount .
in this area , you can design@@ ate how to look like HTML @-@ pages . most insight options are clearly , which is why not specifically for this purpose .
down on the page you can adjust different resolutions for the pictures . thus , those need to look at your website and have a monitor , which have the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , for example , which , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer your site can change the resolution anytime , which means you can change your images with low resolution , as well as for a lower transmission time , search . if he would like to get a picture bigger , he wants to get a higher resolution .
in this single production area , the various folders and the URL may be stored where your website is stored .
for all your HTML files , select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ ord@@ ner for every subsequent sentence .
first , you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this file is stored and select a file for all future images . here you can select either a file or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check whether this URL will be ready for viewer . if you were created for the base file , the URL should be set here , this file should be set here . otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong file .
if you have the HTML files even in the final destination , you &apos;ll have to copy it manually . thus , the import function , see , right , you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ ordination of the current files , but the basic file is located in the folder .
the just above described possibilities have all three on basic file and UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub @-@ file is created , whose name is set in output file .
if you come to a family party , meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , you may need to create a HTML site with these images . however , if you have already checked the images that you have to bring images on the images , shooting location , etc . , you have to make you with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; these work do not even make this work even more .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can also import other into your database . photo features are added with ex@@ - and import .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they can be stored in the file , or if you are stored in the file , it &apos;s advantage of all images in the file , so that you can easily cover all images together , and that file doesn &apos;t keep the file size , however , the file size is .
you can download a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file , edit ... or together with HTML @-@ pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this is an external .@@ k@@ im file .
there is an external .@@ k@@ im file looking for two times . first , the images of the URL are stored in the file &apos;s file . this is , of course , if you &apos;re looking for HTML &apos;s HTML files . this is of course only possible when you create your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML @-@ Export .
in the following dialogue , the dialogue is described by images , which you can read about the menu file , export ...
the most important option of this di@@ alo@@ es is to be able to negotiate with internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are you following three selection possibilities :
when the option is installed in the .@@ k@@ im file , you will have to copy the images in the same file as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option , you copy the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal gyp@@ p files . because most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG files and the XML file itself very small , it &apos;s worth the files to compressed files . if you want to use this , simply select the option to compressed the option .
the last option of this page is a maximum picture size . if you are like to send your friends pictures , as the .@@ k@@ im file is very big . here you can limit the size of the size by setting out that each picture is 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file Imp@@ act ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database was described as described in .
assistant to the import@@ ing consists of four steps . first , you need to select what you want to import or import images , then in which folders should be copied .
it is possible that you have to import the category for the import file person@@ es ( if you are a D@@ ane ) , while this category should be saved in your database . therefore , you &apos;ll be able to import the categories of imported file , and these categories are to be used in your database .
in the fourth step you can specify the categories of the import file with the categories of your current database . an example here you see on the picture .
it must be easy to browse pictures and view : if you see images , you want to view pictures of your Italy &apos;s holiday and see a picture with your friend , you would like to see all pictures of which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) fixed to the information about your images , through ( 2 ) the search and pick up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and customi@@ zation .
K@@ Phot@@ o@@ album was started as a program for managing your images . but it has been extended and today , it does not include your videos . at many places in this manual , more images is spoken , but often includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; stores all its information in the file index@@ .@@ x@@ ml in the top file of their pictures . this is a simple XML file that you want to modify with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy on a disk or revisions in the CV@@ S , you can secure it .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you want to check out the files stored in &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; if you want to launch another database with images , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the option -@@ c start . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / index@@ .@@ x@@ ml .
about the menu entry settings are k@@ photo@@ album ; set up on a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; in the following section of the user interface , you &apos;ll be explained in the following section of the user &apos;s menu .
you can see six different symbols , with which you can read a preview of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setup , you can call for a detailed help to the F1 key and one click on the desired option .
in it you described , as you can design@@ ate for each picture , for example , persons , places and key@@ words . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialogue , which is used to process existing groups . for each existing group you can select a labelling and select a symbol .
in the section the categories were already mentioned in the categories . in the dialog , you can address full board groups , i.e. all members of a group on once in a group , instead of all groups of a Mitt@@ gli@@ ding as described in .
you can see the settings that are available at the top of the board groups . in the top of the top , you can select the category . in the left side , you can select a list with the current category and in the right list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; image plu@@ gin interface . nutritional information you will find on the site of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called by the modules . however , the modules can not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; but most modules have one help to call via the modules itself .
as the modules used by several applications have been used together , you can check out the modules with the demo database . so , you can check the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album @-@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . let &apos;s not say , I would not be warned !
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I common are very different , so it can be very different modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the re@@ part if you want functions with different applications .
the largest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that do not use K@@ IP@@ I , is an album simply feature a file . even if the order is not supported , simul@@ ates it for some modules the order for albums , so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ;
simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album which is simply the current view , so all images that shows you the picture show at the moment .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums out . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser indicates the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then every entry of this category is a record for the module .
or it will be the category called for virtual albums , it will be used as a category for virtual albums , so if you want to use the category persons , it will do so , whether you have selected persons to view and this module will be on the module .
as some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove these from the list of modules . restart the settings dialog , and select the modules , which modules are charged .
on the picture you can see an example of a start @-@ screen , once you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with your own images start .
as you can view it from any other K@@ DE applications , you can &apos;t see the window with your image database . in the section we &apos;ll see on this window but then click here to the entry images that shows you an overview of all the images displayed .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it &apos;s the possibility to see each picture with notes , where the image was recorded either individually or for a larger number of images certain remarks at the same time . if , for example on all pictures Je@@ per , and all images have been shown in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and brow@@ sen as you can read in the section . if you want to see this comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in case you can see three lists with a text box by using persons , places and key@@ words . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because they always use it again , if you enter information about your images .
the following idea is the insert of the images within the list are : if you have shown a family party and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people are shown , so that the names used to be moved to top , which can be more quickly and re@@ written .
if you prefer to use an alpha@@ be@@ tical list , click the symbol for Sor@@ ing to date under the list .
if you have chosen comments for each picture , you would like to view any selected pictures , and you can view these images with comments . click in this case simply to the front and back @-@ buttons , that are on the right side of the picture .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark this pictures and use the menu item multiple entries to one note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all available in the USA . there are San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you will see a browser window of the USA as well as it shows . to indicate that it is a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the remarks : it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new category or category category . attention , this is an entry to make this entry into a sub @-@ category category . attention , this is that you &apos;re looking forward to your categories alpha@@ be@@ tical .
you can move the individual elements of the comments di@@ alo@@ gs by adding the body to form the outer edge of frame , and move . you can also make up their own window by taking it outside the window area .
if you are looking for your needs to your needs , click you to meet with the settings , click the possibility to set up the possibility to build up the current structure and appearance of the F@@ enst@@ ers .
you can also make a complete frame in the frame . if you want to get a window in this window , you can use the options ... and here you will see a / out window . this is shown in the picture .
if you select the entry images in your browser , you &apos;ll find an overview of images if you have no filter . for example , you can see the size of the ball@@ ast , by simply turn right down to the mouse with the middle @-@ mouse button , try it simply .
if you leave a painting on the background of your desktop space , this picture will be set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this image will appear in the image . if you do not have a window with a picture on this picture , a new display of display will be created .
you can also delete the pictures from the images . select the appropriate pictures from you . simply select the removing key or choose the menu to choose from your selection . now you can see the window which you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it can also be saved in this problem . of course , you have to take advantage of the hard disk . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all the required images of the hard drive can be loaded .
images , in which the right upper corner is cut off , are not available on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , you can view the pictures of this pictures , but you can view the preview of these images . however , you can also view these images not with the image .
as you see the files that you want to copy files from the files and again . if you want to avoid the check @-@ in your images if you want to avoid any other words , please buy a bigger hard drive to save all images .
in the menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to make a bit more privacy you want to see you for other un@@ accessible privacy . alternatively , you can also see all images that can see your little sister , you can see and select the menu entry required except current view .
in order to have set them , which are hidden in the case of the case , simply select the menu entry into your little sister , so that all images you are locked . if you want to put the images again , click on Sper@@ re .
it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered into the pictures . in order to install this code , simply select password in the menu of privacy .
please make sure that this picture is not safe . you can read all the pictures on the hard disk . this type of password protection is only able to read the password as un@@ encrypted text ; not very familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to look at private pictures .
the reason why you want to describe all your images with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and hours over hours you want to look at sometime . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; over an image _ and video footage . you can see out of the preview , as described in .
the viewer can see you in view . it shows of course the picture , but additional information about the image can enter the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was made it , etc .
if you want to see the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture , you can also make this easy @-@ to @-@ use and wo@@ unds . all these options are displayed on the viewer . all these options are displayed on the viewer . then the context menu menu can be seen below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click on your browser , you will show you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected persons out of your browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have several pictures in the viewer , you can change between them and return to the keys . you can jump back to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and the end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded into viewer . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then , you can download a new picture after a few seconds . how often the new picture invites you to press the Str@@ ong button and Plus or Min@@ us . start and stopped the di@@ asch@@ au through the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it can be used in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer can use the complete space on the screen . use the input button to change in full screen mode and back .
if you can use the viewer in the picture , you can easily go into the mouse . with the Min@@ us button , you can re@@ take a rect@@ angle with the mouse button , as a Zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point key , you can set your zoom back , so that the picture does not show your zoom , so that the zo@@ oms set the zo@@ oms , so every Pixel does not correspond to the screen a pixels in the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ ings must work in videos , so let &apos;s go and cut out with the Plus@@ - and minutes @-@ button .
with the script menu from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this will not work with videos . you can do comments on the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at the picture , you can &apos;t forget the picture with a person whose name you don &apos;t forget to view it and take the configuration dialogue of the image to enter these names . however , it may only look to mark the picture to mark and look more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images on a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want to see the viewer with the pictures , and it is a good or bad mark that you view one after the others .
for the two examples above , you will see the possibility to view pictures with mercury , while you can view it . features are the letter A to Z and you can read a feature that you can press the corresponding letters . in view , you will see a picture , where the features A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have set features on your images , you can see them in your browser . so , you can use all of them with comments . then , you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD , or whatever you want .
categories and especially characteristics can be displayed in the preview site . if you can view into a preview view , then you can add more to the pictures , by simply the letter to the feature , after the picture was selected . you can see here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you are allowed to paint you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the picture to paint .
the mixture is not stored with the picture , but in the database . on the type , you can also make your gem@@ s later .
in , you can see a painting in the painting . to enter the painting of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; select the picture on the context of the context menu . to end the m@@ als you simply take the cross into the factory wall on the window .
in order to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you have to work the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should also be read and understood .
in the object tree , you can choose individual objects . then , their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire - beli@@ efs yellow .
you can also select several objects at the same time . but not the object of an object is already selected object , because all objects mentioned already with the object already selected .
to add a new object in the object tree , select the position , when you want to add the object , click the icon in the tool bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
there is more possible positions , the following menu is built @-@ down menu , so you can choose the right position :
to edit the menu bar either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click on the application to take these changes . have you un@@ solved values , you will show a message with an error message . then , you can check the input socket and again on application or change the changes .
when you enter the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setting range , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the exhibit with the help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 also contains the user documentation .
if you do not work an texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview of the equity view .
looking on a preview of the O@@ t view and a small example of the scene is described with the chosen texture . if you want to have a sub@@ ordin@@ ated element ( for example , a texture of the texture of your texture , and not the entire texture map ) , cross it locally .
the screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can pull these control points with the mouse button , thus changing the position and change towards the camera .
when a transformation is selected , disappear to control points and it will be displayed a small cross in the wire @-@ view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation , as well as the position for shifts . you can change the deportation by taking the mouse within the whole direction .
each object appears to be a fe@@ asi@@ bility level . you can only specify this value relatively high @-@ grade effects , or as an absolute value . objects are only indicated if they are selected or equal to their vision level , or equal to the selected selected level of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window order as a default setting . the object tree and the view of the object features are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you do not like to adjust the standard window system , or if you need another arrangement , you can set it any way . you can also save several windows and change between different orders .
to check out a window over or under one of the view , go to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position .
to create a new column to create a new column , go to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be fixed to the right or left @-@ hand side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to order several views on each other , go to the summary of the middle of another view . you can then change the views from the views of the cart@@ ons on the card of your views .
the last possible window order are Swedish views : beli@@ efs , which are not set in the main window . to solve a view of the lock , add the summary of the box or click on the arrow guides you to the left uphill arrow on the left arrow .
to complete a view , click on the small cross on the track . to prevent the left , click the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add extra views into the main window . in the menu view , you can find entries for each kind of views . new views are sch@@ woven , you can reach them at any point .
the current window view , you can save the view of the window system . it is displayed as a dialogue where you can store the window order among the existing or new names .
if you create a scene you can use it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to Ren@@ ate , this program must be installed correctly . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to ren@@ ders the current scene , click the symbol Ren@@ ders in the tool bar or choose the menu entry of the scene .
a rating mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s IN@@ I files . it is determined the image size and the quality of Ren@@ ate . if you want to add a scene in various sizes and quality levels , you can add a lot of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of up to full pictures in the highest quality .
if you click on the symbol The go back in the tool bar or in the menu view R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... choose the following dialogue is opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , however , is a name that recognize the characteristics of the mode .
in the box size , you can wear the width and height of the en@@ umer@@ able image . if you want to ren@@ own a small area of picture , you choose the section of the section and enter the image into the input section .
set in the drop @-@ down quality , you can use the properties tab , which is used by a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection @-@ lighting . an exhaus@@ tive description of the installation features can be found in the user &apos;s guide book &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
if a picture comes out with just a straight pixel , several errors arise . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ è patterns and lines and lines , they are not displayed as if they are in the representation smaller than a pixels . this effect is Ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing , to reduce the influence of this mistakes . generally , pictures of this feature is better from the same time .
if you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one stra@@ hl per pixel , this technology is super @-@ sampling .
it supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . the second method is adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ ting , because each Pixel continues to be split and adap@@ ting again because the calculation of the calculated values depend on the calculated values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray a Stra@@ it pixels . if you calculate the depth of a specific number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you calculated the depth of a specific number of pixel , a copy of 4x4 extra points will be calculated with a depth of 5 to 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixels . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel , when the difference between the color values , then the pixels is divided into 4 sub@@ pixel , the individually can be pursued and checked , the maximum depth of the rec@@ ur@@ sion can be set with the depth .
another option of the ali@@ asing effect is reduced by the creation of smoking process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn off J@@ itter@@ ing , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the final setup for quality of the Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is a experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light re@@ flexible . it takes a very long to calculate a scene with this capacity .
on this box map , you can set whether the alpha @-@ channel by POV @-@ Ray are supposed to be calculated . a pixel , then transparent , if the used beams are not made .
opens a new window for the display of the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ sol@@ ete issue . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this reason .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene to import , select the menu entry file for import@@ ing ... and select a file from the analog window .
currently &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er is currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , shows an analog window of all messages .
if you don &apos;t support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
to import objects from object tree in the Editor to import the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code to import text file in the editor . in order to import objects into the scene , just mark the source code in the editor , and drag it into the object tree .
with head and insert in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor , you can also add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene is ren@@ ched . this is the PO@@ V@@ RAY and x @-@ PO@@ V@@ RAY .
when you click on the equity view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation available to the displayed object . put here the path to your document and version 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; looking for external files ( e.g. al@@ fel@@ dd@@ les ) to the P@@ ov@@ ray ; if you do not refer to the file , you also need to find the path to these files . if a file is found in different colors of the library , the first folded file is used .
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for the display of selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for display the selected control points .
the colour of the rect@@ angle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window @-@ type label .
you can adjust the object of the points on the R@@ aster in the context menu of the wire menu . you can set up the sc@@ anners , sc@@ aling , sc@@ outs , and scripts .
larger values also show a closer wire model to the displayed objects , but require more time to Ren@@ ders . for some objects such as the ball you can set the detail stage for two directions .
if you can rely on a lot of detailed projections , if the camera uses a extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of the perspective and vertical projections . this feature takes a better approach to projections , but requires more time to Ren@@ ate .
if you want to view a wall behind the objects , a wall behind the objects . the wall is shown in a chess set pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you view the floor , a soil is below the objects . the floor is shown in a chess set pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you activate the slope , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method used for rendering . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more precise data to the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di .
on this page , you can change existing windows and change new window directives . the window of the window is declared that you can create window @-@ orders and store .
the standard window of the standard window system : shows all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of the window @-@ orders will show all existing windows orders . a new arrangement allows you to add to the button to remove it and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
every window order is identified by the name identified . the name must be clearly and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all the views of the chosen window arrangement . new views can add to the button to add a button with the button to remove the button .
with new column you will create a new column on the right hand side of the new window , you can reach the window under the existing windows , with cart@@ el card and set the view on a box view . this is not a view on the main window , but generates a separate window .
so you &apos;ve just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and now , you would like to start without precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should take the ultimate but easy scene at very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully have the following item , before you decide that you can only receive a black screen . if you are using a 3D program , you should please note these important rules :
if you don &apos;t adjust the camera , no rules for rendering , as a result , you will receive a black picture .
if you don &apos;t add lighting sources , your whole scene is in the dark and get only a black picture .
if you have all faul@@ t@@ less installed , you see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window is set :
they take a bit time to learn the menus and the existing symbols of tool bar . read the documentation , so you can get an appropriate presentation that you can expect from this program .
you &apos;ll need to use these menus and symbols are now often use , so you should check the menus and symbols , and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . in order to follow this guidance , you must remove all objects from the object tree . mark the scene and then select the menu entry of edit . so you have a scene without objects .
the Wireless model view shows how the camera shows the entire scene you create . in particular note that in the fourth wire @-@ view view ( right below ) . this is the view of the camera from the camera . this shows you the result of the scene of the scene .
the object tree has now includes a new entry with the name camera . if you click on , see the content of the exhibition properties , which will find the different parameters of the camera . in the user document to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find further details .
change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , it &apos;s later to reference to the camera that you can change the camera in the camera , with which you can change the camera in the camera . click just off the left mouse button to a control point and drag him to the desired position .
if you press the button on the button , the wire @-@ model beli@@ efs and object tree would immediately change these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera of the camera .
there are many possibilities to create the ground for the scene . you could add a qu@@ el ( add m@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a consistent method for the solution of this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; in fact , it offers a simpler ability to use . you can use a endless level as floor :
a good advice : choose the plain in the object tree , change the name and press the kno@@ b button . in the object tree , the new name is immediately displayed .
the open model view now also shows the level , even if there is a limited level , even if you have the scene you ren@@ ders , the level goes up to the horizon .
if you want to see the object &apos;s object , if you can see the object &apos;s entry + before the object . in this case you will find the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . choose one of these options , modify the possible settings in the object of object properties .
in this scene you should use the bottom to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , so that you can get to learn some of this parameter , and select the values as follows :
choose only the floor in order to set up its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose from a little bit .
in both cases there is a dialogue where you can choose to select the object of object . however , the pig@@ ment will be displayed in the object of objects ( name = floor @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with one click on the button you can look like the pig@@ ment now looks like the pig@@ ment .
of course , this preview of Pig@@ ments only has a matt black material , because you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on a preview . also , you can now use the colours for the pig@@ ment . so there are many possibilities for the pig@@ ment .
if you don &apos;t want to see any color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click the button on the button to go and call the preview .
the material for the floor is now correct . if you get your image now with one click on the symbol , you should obtain the following result :
of course these are not the colors . in the color list , you must have two new attributes . in the color list , you &apos;ll have to do this entry twice ( you can also do it more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colours ) :
choose in the object tree for jed@@ es@@ mal , and change the colors in the view of the object features :
this step should you just run , as you can simply do the fundamental work of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; already , the ball is just as easy as the floor :
in view of the object features , you can &apos;t change the settings for a radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget the input button or to press the kno@@ b ) , making the ball over the bottom , as you would have shi@@ fted a unit into the bottom .
of course , Ren@@ ders are now a wei@@ rd result : as already before , the ball surface is like a matt@@ es Black material . put in the following step a suitable material .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now show a material . as in the floor , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color :
choose to choose the object , and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click on ball pig@@ ment , then select the colour and put the values as follows :
but you can reach the more interesting effects , if you take the time , some finish features :
change the values like in the following screen photos and click the input button .
the settings gl@@ amour and reflection results in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal is not chosen :
you should now have a good impression of what you want to create &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; we &apos;ve already learned as much as you know , but you can create simple , but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ tra@@ cing is a re@@ written method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you have a scene of ra@@ y@@ tra@@ cen , the camera is calculated using any pixels in the scene . the camera is reflected in the scene , and it is broken , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how the atmospheric effects of the light sources have reli@@ ed . so the scene is done in pixel .
as you can imagine , you will not see , the camera is your eye where you can see the scene . without a light source , you will also see the picture , the picture is simple . obviously , each scene is to be appointed , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialogue you can select your file . PO@@ V@@ RAY files are usually the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialogue you can select a file , which you have previously prepared with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er previously .
whenever you open a new model or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub@@ menu , and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name , it is a new file , you &apos;ll need to enter a name and a storage space .
the scene is re@@ printed in the last stored version . all changes since the last store are disc@@ arded .
this menu entry can only select only if you are not stored in the scene .

a B@@ ump @-@ map is a way to change the surfaces , without any be@@ ekeeping on the surface of individually , without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the lenses itself .
it is common to use the same file as well as a dump map as well as an texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ rical forms which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models will then be processed to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture @-@ map is a possibility to give the surface of an object colour on pixel @-@ based application , using an image file as a colour card .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; it is a convenient picture of picture and browser . the application has a file browser , which you can select images for viewing .
pictures can be shown either in a window in size of the image or in full @-@ mode mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can view it with cli@@ cks of the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key Return .
you can adjust whether each picture will be displayed in a window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a certain file , simply take the first signs of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the right corner . if a suitable file is found in the right corner . when a matching fil@@ en@@ ame was discovered , the file is caused by Return from Return or to Es@@ c .
in the dialog elements - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and Di@@ as@@ show , you can set up the work on the display and inter@@ section for the browser , can be set to the key@@ boards for the respective window .
if the image is selected , the images will be open in full mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display is filled with background colour that you can view below . default is no full @-@ mode .
if this point is enabled , invites &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the file , while you can see the next image , if you choose the next image , and it is especially suitable for di@@ as@@ show .
with this option you saves &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; at the end of the last open folders . at the next start &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; these folders in the browser window .
click the colored beams to select a background colour . this is used to fill the background color mode in full mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , the picture is filled with the selected color .
you can choose &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; so that only some of the file types are indicated that the program can also be realized .
this option is increased to the full screen on the full screen . this option is switched on the full screen . this option is switched on .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can select a list of these cuts and can be set up with the right button in the player window . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ specific key@@ boards can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select a short @-@ mail .
you may need to be existing multimedia keys , allowing them to work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; therefore make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ control centre .
the D@@ COP @-@ Interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly used in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the play@@ list , play@@ list browser and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ COP @-@ function could be set &amp; z@@ b ; so look like :
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ options of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE , and Amar@@ ok has even been a separate command @-@ options options .
if the script should not give a feedback if the script will not be carried out because all the required modules are available , and do you use the dialog , so that the script will not be running why a script is not running .
Beg@@ in &apos;s &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ ation for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is selected for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos;
in the folders / Templ@@ ates you can find a lot of original scrip@@ tions in many different languages . you can use it as a base for your own script or simply to expand the required functions . you &apos;ll find fast that the writing by script is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ COP you can exchange your scrip@@ ting data with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easi@@ est way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; that each K@@ DE installation should lie .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the lead of external programs and commands . in addition , the function Ex@@ ec ( ) is used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; is relatively easy to use . here , for example , in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; send noti@@ fications to all the scrip@@ tions . for this reason , scripts should be continuously regarding your standard settings and respond to events . of course , script will ignore the events even if it does not use any case .
con@@ figure We@@ ist is the script to view the setup and store every script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok has to take care on the folders where all data is stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change sign@@ alized that a new piece has been announced . the script will now be more information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the piece length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alized an amend@@ ment to the volume . the new volume is an integral value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ is@@ ite Tit@@ le P@@ AT@@ H@@ s Cont@@ ains the path to the selected files of the play@@ list , if a custom menu is able to remove the script . to remove this entry , to remove d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Cu@@ stom@@ a Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu item Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; at the end , or if the user sends a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do for example . to do it , e.g. the memory of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ill@@ script administration can also install Sk@@ ri@@ pt packages , which can also be compressed with b@@ zi@@ p@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) which can also be used with b@@ zi@@ p@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) that users can recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the extension cat@@ amar@@ script . for this reason , you should make your script packages at right correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameters -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can download it at www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org up to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org , and hang on the Wi@@ ki Sk@@ ri@@ ots site by &amp; Amar@@ ok . you should use the category of Amar@@ ok ; Sk@@ ew will be available .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; K@@ DE ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can easily go to the play@@ list , rather than you have to work with endless menus . maybe you are also looking for a very specific title from thousands of thousands in your collection . by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collecting browser and quick @-@ search for you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you &apos;ve never decide to decide which you would like to listen to you ? then , the play@@ list @-@ browser needs exactly the right for you . and if you &apos;re getting the decision to always choose the dynamic mode , and the smart play@@ list will automatically create the right music after certain criteria .

relative paths for manually ( if you activate these setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the storage location of the play@@ list . otherwise , the absolute position of music files saved .
a current piece of piece changes are evident that the play@@ list windows - / ab@@ ro@@ ses , to keep the ongoing piece always in the visible window sector .
by the product change to the context @-@ browser , the context @-@ browser shows automatically the context @-@ browser , as soon as the next piece is used .
in the section , you can change &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance is in three parts .
in the font section , you can use the use of different writings in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can choose the writings to select the following area : restart window window , player window , and context @-@ browser . press you to select any desired box from the selection dialog .
you can use the Qu@@ al of the choice for yourself the Qu@@ al of the choice and can use a own colour sch@@ ema . use the activated paint sel@@ ector for front and background colour .
playback at the start , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start the playback automatically with the piece at the place where they stopped at the final table .
the window on @-@ screen display allows you to use the O@@ SD card system . if on @-@ screen display , you can use the O@@ SD , a preview of the O@@ SD will be displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click here to choose from the dialogue the desired font for the O@@ SD . the cross@@ field shadow causes the text in the O@@ SD sh@@ aded .
own colors are you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colours for writing and background . click on colour surface . if own colours are not enabled , the default &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ paints are used .
the input box Display @-@ text presents the text in the O@@ SD . through the type of square , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you find a list of the available space holder and what they mean .
the option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . so , you can specify which the screen is set to appear on the screen of a multi @-@ way monitor environment .
the board map Audio Edition lets you select an audio driver from the selection panel . some drivers will enable further adjusting possibilities in this card card .
the card map will be used for inclusion of all settings for your collection . this includes the folders and the type of the database for the collection .
here you can choose the folder , which is to include &amp; Amar@@ ok . in order to include a folder in the collection , mark the check@@ box in addition to its name . this section contains also the cross@@ fields on how to select the selected files .
browse these risks : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the cruci@@ fied as well as their sub@@ ordination to music .
amend@@ ments to monitor : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected file to monitor ( such as music files added or deleted ) , the selected files are performed to monitor the necessary changes to your collection .
rest@@ oring : causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok have added to your collection in your collection files ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) into your collection . the play@@ list will be added later in the play@@ list @-@ browser .
the part of collectors database is used to choose a database for the collection . the combination field driver : can be set between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further facility is necessary in the basement of My@@ S@@ q@@ l .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l installation is used to set the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it is used under computers : the computer port is given to port : the network port is given under port : the network port is available under the database . name : is the database name , to which the connection is made .
use U@@ ser@@ name : and password : to specify the data provided to the database .
the card map last@@ .@@ f@@ m forms the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be used the names of played mo@@ cked on a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and need to create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
here you enter your us@@ ern@@ ame and password for your load .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one at the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
you can send and send the profile for this setting : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; they play the names of the mir@@ ro@@ red pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ts can be used : after activation of this setup , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ts can be played on each piece . note : you don &apos;t need a load @-@ load profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information you will find in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
Amar@@ ok is needed only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages are installed ( including the programs , for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have a small guide how to comp@@ elled K@@ deli@@ bs .
some functions such as the O@@ SD is advance that your window manager will prepare the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . however , we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment .
you can see this error at Tag@@ Li@@ b library in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please note these error message to crash , which caused the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly this is that Tag@@ li@@ b is going to read the Met@@ a @-@ Infos of this file . please note that error at Tag@@ Li@@ b @-@ developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then try out SQ@@ Lite . the support for which is in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a somewhat unusual .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b was compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.x , then this leads to crash with the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE using art@@ s@@ d , then use the autom@@ aker . switch if in@@ active for the setting of sound system , or use at least a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ wards via e @-@ mail ( the E @-@ Mail opens up automatically in a crash ) . if it is a good baking tray and send us a good Back@@ stage , the error will be guaranteed .
this is what many program data available as UTF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ Infos , but this is not a Uni@@ code . the following Perl @-@ script fix@@ es the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error in writing the tags of $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; , $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl @-@ module MP3 : Mp@@ li@@ b . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s symbols nos . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . you can choose the status on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases up to three times a symbol must look at a symbol until this setting shows their effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon L@@ ook@@ up error : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ system Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixel @-@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . you can see using the d@@ d &apos;@@ tri@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ cal Q@@ t version or / etc / d@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf file so that Amar@@ ok can be the right version .
there are some possibilities to clari@@ fy the lightest through the help of one experts from the Uni@@ x@@ or Linux @-@ Distribution . you can also search for help with other users or for developers . use the Forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please insert there just a mistake , if you do something on the heating of a defect in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; there are only a more play@@ list . how do you come to music pieces there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left side and open the desired file . then drag the files into the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start @-@ up window was converted into the statistics window . you can find it among ex@@ tras statistics .
the importance of this symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for evaluation by users , while the points are automatically calculated automatically .
in order to evaluate pieces and select a column show reviews . click somewhere in the new evaluation of the play@@ list . you can also use the d@@ ye on Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
choose the files you want to remove and press the files on your keyboard . or click the right button to your selection , then select the play@@ list from the hing@@ es menu .
drag a play@@ list file with the mouse in the play@@ list and let them leave them , just as you would like it with other files . that &apos;s simple : - )
in the tool bar of the play@@ list , right next to the hin@@ ge button , the button click on the button . click note .
presumably you install X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel package and re@@ install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look after lib@@ ty , this package contains lots of very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ al@@ iser can be reached in the context menu ( about the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you can find it on the menu bar at Ex@@ tras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , this is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question has to support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . how to see , we support this pretty much better audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer may even be text and PN@@ G .
perhaps you can use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which is not supplied in the default setting ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE , input button
start you the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must use a bl@@ ender with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. SB@@ K ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software @-@ Mixer ) . see the D@@ mix D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the issue of this command should help you in search of the problem of mur@@ als and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify another S@@ ink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) .
this does not forget that media first must send an MP3 player . G@@ Stre@@ amer is not easy to go to AL@@ SA . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coding them and sends the PC@@ M @-@ data on AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS is enco@@ ded the data from the first . G@@ Stre@@ amer may be able directly to AL@@ SA , exactly as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimi@@ ze the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ ity ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of FA@@ Q ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ amp Su@@ id is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs . read the error code . read this mistake . read this error of the sound system in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help them .
either use the Arts driver , but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the quick@@ est set co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
presumably you use the Arts driver . use the Arts driver , or reduce the size of the buffer buffer at the control centre and sound &amp; Multimedia , sound system . depending on the buffer , the less applications react the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it .

F@@ LA@@ C : a free open source code for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by F@@ LA@@ C decoder and the external audio Encoder module , so you can read F@@ LA@@ C files and write to F@@ LA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , F@@ LA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : other libraries for the work@@ manship of different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burning on an audio CD .
SO@@ X : an aid program , which can convert between different audio formats and can convert from SO@@ X Audio Encoder module . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you need to read it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ mag@@ er : a fully equipped gasoline system to edit , dis@@ assem@@ bler and analysis of video CDs and Super video CDs .
Nor@@ mali@@ ze : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard @-@ level . that can be useful for example , to make the different recording of different albums by different albums , different albums , that the music pieces have to be announced differently .
e@@ Movi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start your CD and play automatically all the videos on the base file of the CD .
this is a comfortable method , recently opened projects again . the related sub @-@ menu provides a list of these projects . click on an entry to an entry opens .
the current project won the current project . if the project has been stored once , the previously used file , otherwise it is asked after a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
stores the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ames . K@@ DE &apos;s dialogue can be displayed below , using file and file &apos;s file for the project file .
saves all of the open projects . that &apos;s the same , when you would call for each individual project file for storing .
closes the current project . if a project is changed and not stored , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; according to what happened . you can choose between storing and changes . furthermore , you can also break the project and open the project so open .
includes all of the open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each not stored project , what should happen to happen , just as they would have called for each project .
includes all of the opened projects and end &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for every not stored project , what should happen , what should happen , as if you were called the file again .
if you call this entry , you can add the files directly from the upper @-@ view files into the project . if the current project is set out in the top view , if the current project is a data set , the files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
this dialogue is the same as the project for the current project . the only difference is the additional button on the way . the only difference is the additional button , that can only be used for burning media . the distill@@ ery dialogue can only be open if the project has already contains data .
open the properties for the current project . here , you can use many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above what is the ? -@@ Hilfe ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . the data of the previous session is always used , even if this function is not used . it is intended for you more than aid , so that you can see the medium already existing files and folders .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . this function causes up to remove files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this feature is no files from the medium , it bl@@ ends only the previously imported files .
this allows you to modify the CD copy of a CD on another medium . alternatively , you can also use the possibility of cl@@ one instead of a standard copy . you should also prefer , if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
this enables DVD copy of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use the copy of a DVD with the help of a DVD player . thus , the target medium must be large enough to take advantage of the entire ( video ) data of the source code in the original form .
opens up the dialog to a CD @-@ R@@ W . so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
open the dialogue as a format for a DVD . with this dialogue you can install a DVD ± R ( W ) format , which means that the content is completely removed . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can write the choice between the writing modes and incre@@ mental credit .
flamm@@ able CD image . the dialogue is being burned down in a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
combus@@ t is an earlier DVD copy . the dialogue comes with a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can be burned down by pressing the distill@@ ation button .
a previously shot DVD video can be converted . this slide @-@ style can also be used after the read of a DVD in the content view , but can also be used in the same @-@ standing video , but can also be used to modify the size of video , co@@ ction settings , and even possibilities to modify the size and cut black edges .
it shows information about the added medium . this information is shown in the content view and include properties of the media , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool manufacturer &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool bar is visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small body is displayed at the bottom of the F@@ enst@@ ers . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status is hat@@ ched .
if the contents can be activated , a review of your files and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , the contents are displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , sper@@ m and un@@ locking of the running or out of the media .
it allows the contents of view or from . the content view allows you to choose from the files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with an appropriate CD / DVD inside the folders .
the head@@ lines in the Project view is a native area that contains only visible if the project is open @-@ plan projects . the head bar has no real function , it looks nice and turns out the project view from the remaining views .
this opens a slide window to change the key@@ boards for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keys to the button .
this is starting the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup assistant for burning CDs and DVDs have to be set . therefore , system administrators need to enter the password for system administrators at the start of the assistant to the system administrators ( root ) .
the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings are made . nearly all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is intended for person@@ alize and rep@@ airing of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; it is also equipped for many other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a sh@@ ell@@ u@@ pt .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions can be used either the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the something comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functionality , therefore it is rather your taste and the way of your task , to give you the accompanying programs .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to ensure that , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then , you should make something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have all &amp; K@@ DE ; they have , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mostly two other parts , which are described below .
the standard D@@ COP @-@ interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as cop@@ y@@ CD , format DVD , and other functions for creating new projects .
COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ x CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ x CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f Fra@@ y@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f Fra@@ y@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) v@@ oid @-@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) v@@ oid @-@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) v@@ oid @-@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) v@@ oid bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ image ( C@@ URL URL ) v@@ oid bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( URL URL )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can use a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project ! reference is possible to modify the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ a .
k@@ 3@@ b offers the top of a large K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface , which is only available on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
V@@ oid cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string URL , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) v@@ oid remo@@ ver ( Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) v@@ oid remo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String Quartet ) v@@ oid ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String Quartet , Q@@ String new@@ name ) v@@ oid set@@ up@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and files from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple files and add files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ x / home / tru@@ st@@ eg / Som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ via ; is an audio CD ; read @-@ it for &amp; K@@ DE ; and with it very easy audio CDs ; they are read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the Encoder installed on the computer .
&amp; Customer Service ( for the read of &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many co @-@ files ( los@@ s@@ free compression ) is supported by default ( these co@@ di@@ erer packages are still installed from the Linux distribution ) . additional co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have installed them ) .
at first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read and read in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually a per title ) compressed in the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or as well as other formats such as los@@ s@@ free F@@ LA@@ C .
for the first step that read the &amp; CD ; it is compiled by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ via ; c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package : if that &apos;s not yet installed , it must be done .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ ils are already installed . however , all these programs are not necessary to comp@@ ile it . however , if F@@ LA@@ C is not used , the installation is not necessary .
what is to use the encoding / file format ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction of co@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for cop@@ ing audio CD ; s : as already said , c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia uses the protection of audio CD ; it is not possible to use an protected audio CD ; even if not use the mechanisms of the cop@@ i@@ protection . avoid the purchase of copied audio CD ; it &apos;s simply the purchase of copied audio CDs ; s !
during the set only one should be done ( the setup dialog , but so often called to be called for a suitable configuration ) , the hard drive is declared to read a CD ; the hard disk explains . this is going to understanding the slim approach of the user interface , which you can frequently take place at the beginning .
can convert many formats - depending on which Ko@@ di@@ erer programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can be complete without a network , whereby everything is included .
this is only a short list of the commands of the main f@@ enst@@ ers . on the side step by step , there are more information about how this program is used as well as in the descriptions of the Programme for the configuration of the program .
the CD@@ DB request on the CD data is based on the CD @-@ data in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online ) , in the latter case you must use the connection to the internet . )
start and start - if a Encoder in the tab will be configured in the setup version - the coding .
a sub @-@ menu opens with a list of the available Encoder so that the choice can be read with another Encoder as standard settings . it &apos;s note that before the en@@ coder is configured in the tab for the setup settings .
the file manager , so that a succ@@ es@@ ene file will be chosen to en@@ code instead of a complete &amp; CD .
open the setup dialog to con@@ figure the type of information ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; ended ) .
open the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ via ; with different card cards ( such as Encoder , to set the enco@@ ders ) . hi@@ erh@@ in you must go before the program can be used before the program can be successful !
this chapter describes a sound quality , co@@ di@@ erer and compression rates and helps you to choose the right track .
if any audio @-@ information is supposed to go , an los@@ s@@ less audio format is needed . in addition to F@@ LA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ sites &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the cons are low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices to play these files .
among the audio formats used , MP3 , and OGG the most common . OGG like today a light advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rate ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but this bit rate will produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be delivered with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rate ) , but compared with OGG slightly lower quality .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG players are present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 , these devices are mostly the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = this setting provides good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = this setting is usually offer for most people and most music pieces of acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to $ 320 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex pieces and less complex parts of the piece . good enough for stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs always need 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of titanium . some older devices need CBR@@ s . good enough for stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate approximately 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a titanium . good gen@@ ug for music , portable devices and auto stere@@ os@@ cope . but not good enough for better HiFi @-@ stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you don &apos;t have the highest quality , without looking at the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that will be added to manually or by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b program are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can use / needed with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ via ; and the coding program to create the files and file names , as well as the characteristics of the music files .
in connection with Ko@@ mer programs , there are often a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and these parameters . the manual or help to the coalition may explain the switch for these programs .
for example , add to the &amp; CD ; title to add MP@@ 3@@ s with l@@ ame are enco@@ ded , the switch has to be added by l@@ ame and the title parameter from &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ via ; the result looks like : &apos; -@@ t@@ t { 5 } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ via ; parameters which can be used ( = button designation in the assist@@ ants ) :
that &apos;s what you can download the audio CDs that you can download the information on your computer . it &apos;s note that only from the text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legally , but I am not able to give information on the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so there is no need to be added to the music by the music . all information can be added with a B@@ um@@ mel by a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; cold audit@@ orium , the e @-@ mail address can be used as the system used . in this type of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address will not be used when using the server ( this can &apos;t be used , but only the programmer should be reviewed . )
there are many countries in many countries , copies of the main database . when &amp; cold audit@@ orium is set up , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally next to the next door system is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and the load between computers .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirrors for online call from &amp; CD ; information during the read of a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
what &apos;s read@@ out program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there is rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia is used ; who &apos;s more precisely , search in the source code ... This was always the best choice for audio CDs ; see . to note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia package from the matching distribution must be installed , if this is not yet done .
to get the desired WAV files , the enco@@ ders can be chosen for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( an los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab . other co@@ ils can be added to this map .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package has to be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used . this is also required for the defined co@@ di@@ erer . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after the installation of a Col@@ ossi@@ ers you can receive more information about his switch , as l@@ ame @-@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ sol@@ ete window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . it has to be replaced by the installed Ko@@ sch@@ ame .
this can check out many causes of device ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) , try both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could give an indication of what wrong is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy audio CD ; read the handle of the &amp; CD ; this will not be gel@@ ingen !
there is a chapter with a step for step @-@ by @-@ step . even if you use other settings , this tips can return to tips as you go .
have you read the complete manual , everything understood , are still un@@ certain what do is ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information about how to establish those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we &apos;ll start the program for the first time , we &apos;ll be able to read all our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll be able to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sample ( tags ) .
there are c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be used as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , as it is not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source code to you , whatever you can do .
please make sure that the / usr / share / cd is that you own write ( eg ; they try to copy it with the counter @-@ quer@@ or to copy ) .
the first section deals the basic set of &amp; cold audit@@ orium ; something which is thought to be done only once and
the second section describes the procedure for read a &amp; CD , which must be repeated for each made &amp; CD .
here we define the sound image quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 up to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy where we are la@@ zy , we share the program with that fre@@ ed@@ b to get the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet access .
although we can change these settings , we will likely be very likely to read a &amp; CD ; even if the matching settings are found .
the device driver device will be given to the reading program , so that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can read .
/ dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name . if that &apos;s not work with other programs , you can also see a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab file and try out there with the existing entries of the device used for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
card card general settings . here you don &apos;t have much to do . here , there can be an additional conversion . in our example , everything will be shown below , as shown in screen photo .
only For un@@ complete information please select , so you will be informed if data are missing to the creation of sample ( tags ) .
card card CD ; settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically be downloaded via the internet of a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer has to be connected during the read of the &amp; CD ; with the internet , it can be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second drop is easier , will start a &amp; CD ; this is with low risk @-@ related directory entry or day entries , you can be easily changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame will be changed with con@@ qu@@ ery - &gt; um@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with Ki@@ d@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; day .
apart from this example , if you want to enter the database before . however , it &apos;s not possible to use the database . however , this is worth up to 620 MB , and if you &apos;re worth checking up , too , the two selection will be selected , at least the first . mode of mode is set up on the following card .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ for us . these are settings for the data on the Internet . how does the system you will get on the Internet . how does the system you will get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . set all such as it is shown in the screen photo .
mode : we do not downloaded the database , we want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the page fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and look after a mirror server in your proximity . however , this setting is distributed between computers . however , this setting will work as first attempt .
both work on the server , because there are many fire@@ walls the protocol 88@@ 80 standard format , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf in the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to use any &amp; CD ; data on the fre@@ ed@@ b server must be sufficient .
simply take the settings of the screen photo . ( make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
the number of places at the same time : for debt , there is a reason why there are more than one at the same time when using only one existing drive ? parallel to reading and Co@@ aching ? the author knows it not , just trying to try himself .
CD ; after align@@ ing the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial .
custom @-@ defined files for temporary files are stored in which the WAV files are stored in which WAV files are stored in a private file . don &apos;t forget the files in a private file . don &apos;t forget to make this file if you want to do something with the WAV files .
all such as it is on the screen photo . the order is a bit long , under circumstances must be slightly damaged in order to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned earlier , the increase bit rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption .
note &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the constra@@ int of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1st &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 , in case of a later amend@@ ment of tags . % f and % are internal variables for the names of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screen photo . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of the same time enco@@ ded WAV files : at a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine , it can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we &apos;ve just finished the basic facility of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ via ; this configuration is used as standard for each of a CD @-@ CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section it will be described as the process of reading on the hard drive . first , we will make a connection to the Internet because we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process is described in this section . the process is described in this section , must be repeated for each application &amp; CD .
since we are using a &amp; CD ; these are still not included in fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you can learn the &amp; CD ; you can learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of pick up out from the internet . comments will be able to indicate the differences .
do not try to find out the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , you must now have the &amp; CD ; into the drive , which is defined in the main window .
after a brief moment the pieces should be listed and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; identified and identified by c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia .
if this is not done , then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD was able to be picked up from fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled and in addition , the name of the artist and the album are indicated .
for the case , there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; you will select a window , and you can select the database entry , in which your opinion is on the best to your &amp; CD ;
if you don &apos;t have chosen the check@@ box for the automatic qu@@ ery of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the side &amp; CD ; you can not have a local database , but if you don &apos;t have local database , but data from the internet , you need the connection to the internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the Tit@@ le of the first piece
enter the data on your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen photo . title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Up@@ eller title &apos; , the rest of the data on the input box &apos; album &apos; .
the artist does not have to be given no longer in the input box &apos; Up@@ eller title &apos; , unless you have a composition with various artists for each piece .
the bottom commentary box can be used for the individual comments of di@@ el per piece , the commentary box of the album will be used for comments on all tracks of the CD .
attention : after successful release of the data from fre@@ ed@@ b is not empty , but it contains a good idea to check the content of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors , so that you are not only with the artists and album name ( e.g. if all words with large letters will start or not ... ) , but also to check whether it is any adverse events .
note : in this example , we use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v2 tag , you don &apos;t use unlimited field@@ bus , at least on what is possible . this option is set on the board map by default settings ; take a look into the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the day @-@ information from the files later on any time with the day editor . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 Tags .
tags are supported by all co@@ ke or file formats . see the help to Ko@@ di@@ erer in order to get more information on the assistance .
in this example , this is not essential because we don &apos;t want to use the style . for more information you can &apos;t go on the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found among rock .
after the election of &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window , click just click on line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors will be back and you can see that the fields for the album have already been recorded for the first piece . just enter the entries for the field of current product . add the title of the piece on any case and other information you want .
click the next line on the main window and procedure you see in the same way until you have given all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is sorted into one of these categories .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and the album are indicated by the piece list .
note that there are an check @-@ in before each line of a piece . make sure that all pieces are selected . make sure all the pieces are selected , or press the button on the bottom of screen to select all pieces on the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces .
when clicking on the button , it started out by clicking on the button , so this window will be on OK and then we will see a look at the window with the entries and track what runs .
click on the shift of orders on the order board . it is in the left upper half of the F@@ enst@@ ers , directly under the kno@@ bs of the tool bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece will be read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the F@@ enst@@ ers in the status line .
this error message you see if you try to work with a co@@ di@@ erer , which you don &apos;t have successfully installed . pieces are not successful with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the file for the T@@ MP file and the target file doesn &apos;t know what we have given here in the example . did you checked whether you have a write access to the folders for the temporary files and the target file ? ; - )
now it is clear , why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece of it , but we finished it . but we have a new entry for 1 into the format MP3 . in order to read and en@@ code parallel . please note the status message in the lower part of the F@@ enst@@ ers , it &apos;s now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration mode to supp@@ ress this behaviour , the number of parallel processes is the result . the used calcul@@ ator with an AM@@ D@@ 64 doesn &apos;t seem to read the problem for simultaneously and en@@ code ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title will be read , while another piece is enco@@ ded , and a third order is enco@@ ded in the waiting @-@ long turn . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a good time in the upper left part of the F@@ enst@@ ers .
for successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ via ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ 00 or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia . if you want to generate audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the coordination of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ gue , you &apos;ll find a pre @-@ free package deal with CV@@ S as part of an important &amp; K@@ DE package . if you are part of an important &amp; K@@ DE package , you can install your package multimedia from your distribution . if you read this , you probably have to do it ...
this section is designed to persons who comp@@ ile source code , and not intended for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for using your needs , if you &apos;re looking for your needs , then it is the following correct for you :
a program of different programs calls for a lot of different programs . on the best , you can read the step for by the options and settings . it shows the photos of the settings the settings , and contains comments for options that do not be used for the example .
hello , even on that ? even if only the menu was cli@@ cked up after the start @-@ up of the program , without any point of how it is to go out from that of the program starts ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive is ) , or from the very un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it ? who reads it , probably already started the program started . it should look like that look like :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t add this manual for a manual and change or change it may be . at least after the contact with the author . and if you read this , it has read this section and hence it will agree with this proposal .
strange if you &apos;ve managed to get the source file from &amp; K@@ DE and SV@@ N , then you do not need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ es@@ pi@@ eler . besides others , he has real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that do not have other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .

supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or Tex@@ ter@@ name ) . K@@ Mid determin@@ es the process of this process .
seat support . if you finish &amp; K@@ DE ; during the match of a song , K@@ mid will start with the same song by the same song .
supports external MIDI @-@ syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first you can select open ... from the menu file . it appears to select the usual file dialogue with which help you select the desired song .
you can also leave a file from a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; cold window ; window will also be covered with several songs in the same time .
to play a music piece , open it and press the button to play in the tool bar , select the entry of the menu from or press the Le@@ ert@@ aste menu .
please note that &amp; k@@ mide ; one piece will automatically start when you go on the &amp; k@@ mid &apos; window . ( in several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played by each other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece , you can jump to any point , by using the middle mouse button , using the thr@@ ott@@ le and driving .
if you find that a song can be played on fast or slow down , you can click on the arrows at the left and right of the tem@@ po@@ display . to get the original pace , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the Le@@ ert@@ aste has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the button , or the menu of the menu entry into the menu , so breaks the reproduction . press the le@@ ep button while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid - the playback button .
lyrics can be stored on two types in a music piece . some pieces are using tex@@ ter@@ name , other song lyrics and again other both pieces . some pieces will not have a text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set up what events are supposed to be displayed , and even better : the er@@ ect sty@@ p will automatically dis@@ connect to the kar@@ aoke text . but you still have the possibility to change it , if you want to see the other kind of type .
if you want to set an erection @-@ type show , choose from the menu settings the entries of the events or song events . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you can summari@@ ze . this will be played in the series . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently .
to specify a collection , first open all collecting manager . in the menu , you will find the menu under Organ@@ ise Organ@@ ise .... Click here on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by using Kop@@ er and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection is contained at the beginning of the same songs as original .
if you have more than a collection , you can adjust the desired change in collecting manager .
in the temporary collection , all songs , which you want to add any other collection .
when using this application , this collection is not stored . concerns , if you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , she has to add a song in collecting manager . there , you can add a song with the button . it appears in the file dialogue with which help you select the desired song .
a second method to add a song , depends on the setting , add the collection .
when automatic hin@@ ts to the collection is enabled , a piece of opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) will automatically added to the active collection .
if Autom@@ ated add to the collection is not enabled , when it is activated , the opening collection will be activated and divided the temporary collection . this collection will continue to be added .
to remove a song from a collection , you &apos;ll need to select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removing .
you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you choose the series from the menu @-@ menu of the menu , choose the songs in the order , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove or random sequence in the menu , the order is new .
for a song , select it in collecting manager or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump on a song , select the button on one song , entry next song from the menu or press the button arrow on the right .
to jump back a song , select the kno@@ ck@@ down piece , the record piece from the menu or press the button on the left .
to delete a collection , open the Colle@@ ctors manager , select the collection and click the button on the button .
the temporary collection can &apos;t be deleted . however , this doesn &apos;t matter if they are not stored by &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is essential for syn@@ thesizer , which are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map General @-@ MIDI events in events which understands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map showing all events of the type change patch to B@@ right piano in the change of type change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et conver@@ ts and thus always play trumpet if originally a piano play .
if you have only a sound card , you do not need a MIDI @-@ map , because all Sound@@ cards are compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you must edit the corresponding file of hand ( with your favorite sed@@ itor ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that are all necessary settings for playing a piece .
each section may only appear , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP -@@ section , which is often appear as desired . the requirement is , however , that every appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) .
DE@@ F@@ INE P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; A more Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Op@@ tions ... EN@@ D Op@@ tions ... EN@@ D
you see that DE@@ F@@ INE is needed to show that a section begins ( except for Op@@ tions ) and EN@@ D that the end of an interval is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , that I can use in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section , how the pat@@ ches of General MIDI will be displayed on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left @-@ hand side of the equ@@ ation is ignored . it is believed that the GM patents are in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order , and no row for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all the tone for example . if your keyboard does not need to take a bug ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can find a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which like a ri@@ fl@@ ation . do you apply the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP -@@ section :
so if a MIDI @-@ file is a Note with patch 127 ( ri@@ fl@@ ation ) , it takes Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , ir@@ respective of which are sound in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the concept of Tro@@ mmel , Patch , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one , in which the clay is the pitch of the same drum means ( such as some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP Section is used to specify how notes on a specific channel or instrument are shown here :
like the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP -@@ section , the order of lines very important , as their presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can use multiple Key@@ Road@@ maps for each channel and define each instrument for each instrument . you need to use different names in the first row .
key@@ boards are used mainly to form notes on the percussion channel . look at the supplied Key@@ Road@@ maps .
this section can be used to form some channels on others . if you want for example the first and second channel , you make the very easy to see in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP -@@ section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section , i.e. 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , rebuilt according to the following pattern :
if you use Key@@ map option , the key@@ map will need to be defined in the file . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , you will need to change the patch on this channel . in this case , you will always use patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example , to use the Per@@ tel@@ e @-@ Patch on the Per@@ k@@ flash channel .
the value of the Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events is multip@@ lied to the Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events , and then it will be re@@ directed to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then it will be re@@ directed . the value of 40@@ 96 is used , so in the Map file doesn &apos;t have a dec@@ im@@ al@@ mas .
this setting is needed , because GM announced that a keyboard that should play a sound with the value of 40@@ 96 . but unfortunately , some key@@ boards are to play a oct@@ ave up to oct@@ ave . to try the right value on your keyboard , you need to try out a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI @-@ map , open the dialogue MIDI @-@ settings . you can find in the menu under settings , point MIDI @-@ settings
the channel view is a window with a whole row of piano ( one for each MIDI @-@ channel ) . on this piano sounds you see what sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . if you have changed an instrument , the button is not possible on green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the mir@@ ed sounds . view to the menu settings below the point channel view : settings
the tempo LCD shows the speed , with which a song is played . higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can find the pace of a song change . if you can find , one song is to be quick to follow the text , you can slow down the pace . to change the pace , you can use the arrows at the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played like a music piece . it contains the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes on very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t worry , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while using a good syn@@ thesizer , you can also use a similar sound quality . with a MIDI file , you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have to control the control over everything .
this can happen when you have a binary distribution ( rpm , De@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; because of the problem with the problem . to eliminate the problem , you need to download a source distribution and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole file to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agree &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; drop . open the folders that you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; choose all files out , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid &apos; window .
in advance , activate the Automatic start @-@ up note , otherwise the files are added to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can use the arrow @-@ off left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to re @-@ manufacture the default , you can stick to the LCD double .
I have done on a &amp; K@@ DE ; a window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; if I want to play a Kar@@ aoke file ( if I want to play a Kar@@ aoke file ) or want to play a file , only in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window change the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid &apos; window .
if you want to listen to a file if you want to add a file , without them to add the setting , please turn the setting , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection of files .
let us assume you want to play the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ O.@@ D. . so , you can add the automatic gearbox to enter the collection and open A.@@ F. your temporary collection then this is a MIDI @-@ file .
then do not include B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards sent . all many thanks ! if I see these songs or the postcard , en@@ med me the , continued to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .

the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ eable windows . there is always a window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the play@@ list . and finally , there is an information panel that will only appear if there are information therein .
it is possible to modify the prefer@@ ential connections among the menu read signs , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries to be played according to each other , you should use the Dau@@ gh@@ tly play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional Hier@@ archy , if you get an entry , his group , and all his sub@@ groups are copied to the current category , and the playback starts with the specified entry .
these categories can be changed by direct editing of the XML file files . of course , you can &apos;t do it through an editor . however , the different files are used in the / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps . of course , you can choose from the menu , and there is the next mode mode . if the connection of a sub@@ group is displayed only the XML content of this portion .
after changing of XML files , the menu must be chosen by the same with re @-@ play@@ list and select either the tran@@ scrip@@ ting mode , or another category .
all changes are lost when working mode left or another group is selected without the play@@ list .
as a result of the comfort of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched by using the XML configuration files .
the animation can be activated by ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ be@@ c and change of &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ serving option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / exact .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml please note . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation does not need to be too short , it will automatically be finished by opening of another source . this would be at the end of animation , however , the user can end a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be saved ; &amp; lt ; in@@ tr@@ insi@@ sted ; &amp; lt ; / 100 ; / 100 ; / s@@ mil@@ ates ; &amp; lt ; / s@@ mil@@ k ; In the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MIL which are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player .
there is a rider on configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialogue between &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here , the path can be set up by the M@@ Player and the intermediate storage size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool bar of k@@ m@@ player . here , the output of m@@ player is clearly shown here .
there is no Reiter for this playback device in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ through , such as the set of back@@ end per mi@@ met@@ ype . here is an example , such as a &quot; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ ab @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; you can even play the special field of bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
in order to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime Type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash , can be specified in the setup of K@@ DE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is in a consoles to start using the browser module library . if there is no defect , the back@@ end issue within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
to make a pre @-@ pre@@ amplifier for a certain M@@ ime type ( of course only if this has been identified ) , this has to be done by manual changing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ through . for example , ph@@ on all o@@ gg files are stored :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can be downloaded from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) and can be configured to use the device using the configuration can be used , or the configuration file can be used manually or the configuration file can manually be edited manually .
for the configuration of V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings can be used in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ iness &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . if necessary coding must be found out of a single encoding ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name is likely to contain a DVB @-@ in .
as the V@@ DR support from Linux to use the only X@@ video game ( presumably this type of video ) does not work on the first screen ( : 0.0 and X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig . ) , this type must be contained in the X@@ Free@@ 86 server .

is there any information such as I take my CD@@ ROM drive , if I play from him ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is being used as user root after the use of the device . this is essential to make sure / dev / c@@ drom shows to the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slowly onto , why every time my CPU must be checked on their performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ players automatically needs the final stored value , just the first time x@@ ine will test the CPU .

document classes : this type &#91; Letter &#93; , article &#91; book &#93; , published &#91; Letter &#93; , published &#91; Letter &#93; , published ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , published ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ user .
en@@ closures : her@@ eby the drawing of the system should be used . modern systems now use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . if necessary , UTF @-@ 8@@ X should be washed ( as specified as UTF @-@ 8@@ X ) ( correct work@@ manship of the &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; documents ) .
this list contains additional packages for in@@ tr@@ s &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; for the integration , they only add only in the check@@ box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , documentation ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with the German DIN rail regulations ) should always be used for the preparation of German text .
new users make any concerns . this is just a short description of the functions and further information are given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile - just as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting needs of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate environment ) . however , you may still have a modest appearance of the output file . however , it saves you through the modest appearance of output file . however , you &apos;ll save you through the high@@ lighting period and time .
after entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ &apos; command } ) from &amp; k@@ ile ; they automatically creates an empty line ( for example , \ \ &apos; command } ) ; this function can be de@@ activated in the following settings ( e.g. \ \ &apos; command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the area of settings ; ... La@@ Te@@ X commands .
normally , all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; the document of the document can be found in the following elements ( part is the h@@ ott@@ est and sub@@ tract ) :
at the view of the document , the individual elements can be changed through a mouse click on the respective and can be seen .
when creating his own &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; -@@ files can be very helpful . once a DVI @-@ file ( eng@@ l . D e I n@@ ap file ) &#93; has been created , navigating &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer on the respective row in &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; -@@ source code .
a DVI @-@ file again contains a description of the format document and other information such as the font size of &amp; tex ; or &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; . there are many tools for viewing , conversion and print out of DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and straight@@ away .
when using the device , the elements of DVI ; -@@ file is cli@@ cked down into the DVI / L@@ ate@@ x system . the pre@@ dat@@ ory search is the exact opposite . once upon a section of the &amp; L@@ ate@@ x section , the source code is checked , it is designed for the same place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer .
master document : this function will be simpli@@ fied with multiple files . with a Master document , the work will be simpli@@ fied with other integrated .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project can be set up with a project for project settings .
quick construction : the &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; source code is compiled and the result is displayed automatically ( unless error occurs in the source code ) .
file for monitoring : in this mode the DVI @-@ file is available for in@@ tr@@ ing â s in@@ feed button , and it is not a call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction .
when viewing the editing tool , the three large number of selected areas were to be developed . the first selection of the document has been developed into the document , chapter , sections , ... Re@@ ver@@ ing &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection panel is for example , for example , key@@ words , letters , notes or verses . the reduction of males are :
label : this command is created a section for a section , an image or different element .
reference : is used for the reference to a set designation ( Sel@@ ection of a selection panel ) .
when using quot@@ ation is a select list with &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this is why the author has good experiences on a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand , the author are written .
this is the last selection panel with the name of Gr@@ Ã ¶ n@@ Ã e , &quot; it is possible that the font ones will be set . however , the font ones will be set up on the following text :
at the call of &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection of a new document provided by the documentation of the document art and fes@@ tivities of the settings . 2 . document can be written from the ground up with the hand .
the cl@@ amps according to the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . adjustment &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font size . the font is not specified at the beginning , this may be done by the text .
once the above source code has been added to the &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; source code may be compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way is the use of the menu or the Kn@@ op@@ fs quick @-@ range .
the source code must be saved before the comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the store automatically .
mud , the comp@@ ile of the document should be sought after failure . when using quick construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be launched . if the case is not the case , this should not be considered to be applied to the protocol .
an environment ( English ) is a text that will be written differently than the rest of the book . for example , a report written by the signature is supposed to set up a couple of S@@ Ã ¤ t , and then set the in@@ scrip@@ ture of the font ones in the area â s @-@ Ries@@ ig@@ â s . ( English Hu@@ ge ) .
rates are only within the environment ( by \ \ &apos; { environment } to \ \ end of the environment } to \ \ end of the environment . there are no compl@@ ain ( number of ) for the in@@ verteb@@ rates within a environment .
there are many contex@@ ts for creating reading and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , sub@@ types , sub@@ missions , etc . additionally , these commands are either using the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ &apos; { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and as long as long as it is closed , until he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be demonstrated with \ \ emp@@ h { Word } .
\ \ ratio : created a quot@@ ation in the document . the quot@@ ation starts with \ \ &apos; { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { figure } .
after the background to writing the source material with the &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; Ex@@ cep@@ tional language was presented , now a step @-@ by @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ;
once a bit of text was given a bit text , a few adap@@ tations of the document should be closed . should , min@@ d , a few positions in fat and short @-@ proof pressure and a poem for application to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been reviewed , using Editor @-@ view or Str@@ g E again to the game ( internal viewer ) . an external viewer must be closed .
once the DVI @-@ file , it is created , the document printed or in a &amp; post@@ script . / PDF file can be converted . simple , try and fun .
DVI ; is a location independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ º F ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; for example , there are many different types of the .@@ d@@ vi @-@ edition such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script / / PDF converting or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI @-@ file , the same steps as for the compilation of the document ( see ) . on the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed by using file ( in viewer ) ( unless the printer is correct ) .
the tool@@ bar of the DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as the DVI / file from the &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; source code is created , the conversion can begin to start @-@ up other formats using the buttons in the tool bar .
the pre@@ heated search goes to the direct jump of the Editor with the right @-@ up position within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a corresponding attitude for all &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; -@@ Bin@@ issal@@ em . for this purpose , only Modern under settings K@@ ile one must be balanced .
in order to enable the pre@@ text search , the mouse is positioned in a row of the source tex@@ tures and then cli@@ cked on pre@@ sides . the jump to the right place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer will then be done .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; document &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; they have to be specified as a text editor . ( settings are set in a text editor ... )
if you want to turn quick by quick construction &amp; DVI ; they don &apos;t know a mistake . should be a mistake , this is displayed in the protocol file and in the news window .
c@@ ann@@ eled La@@ Te@@ X error occurs in the source code . in editing , the protocol file is getting used in the error . in order to keep the faul@@ ty line , you must be cli@@ cked on the error in the protocol , navigating immediately to the faul@@ ty line .
as soon as on the appropriate button in the tool bar , a window on the selection of the document will be presented . the pre @-@ set charges are :
in selecting a document , a document can be written either from the ground or to create a new document . additional information are included in the section .
H@@ Ã ¤ t users of &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; usually the same introduction for nearly all documents . templ@@ ates in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and uploaded to make the creation of a new document .
to create a new model , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / L@@ ate@@ x ; file @-@ file is created or a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new model using an existing document and a selection from the file &apos;s original document .
when creating a new document , a new document is replaced by file New , some character can be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or drawing coding ) . these variables can be set up in settings K@@ ile ... settings .
when creating its own template , it is therefore necessary to know what are replaced by these variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this character is replaced by the input in document class . typically , it will be used as follows : \ \ Support Class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ .
the easi@@ est way to make an original is the use of the assistant and thus verb@@ al file for commands in the editor . once the document was created on this way , the following steps was completed :
when creating a new document , then the own template instead of the standard series can be balanced .
a model can be created from every &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; files are created . a simple way to create a presentation , should be searching for an Internet in the Internet and the following steps were through .
&amp; k@@ ile ; a text editor was used as an internal editor . a text editor was published by many different types of text files ( including &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings are made directly from &amp; k@@ ile .
in order to learn more about it &apos;s &amp; Kate ; and his eyes should be attracted by the manual of Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; they can be found directly with the reading of the chapter with the Editor of &amp; Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; a very practical &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; -@@ command @-@ ference , which can be called for the help of the help of La@@ Te@@ X @-@ Re@@ ference . it contains almost all commands that can be found in &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; use as well as their syn@@ tax .
a double @-@ click with a Str@@ ong button to be ordered by the &amp; tex ; however , that means that in contrast to the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1 double click on this way .
when running the text with ge@@ aring sh@@ aker mouse button , the full text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys , the arrow out the arrow out of the swelling parts of the swelling parts of the Edit@@ or@@ bit windows .
&amp; k@@ ile ; eyes showed a wide variety of species of source tex@@ ts and these remarkable . for example , the &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; commands of normal text and mathematical formations are caused by a different color .
many assistant training brands are within the text . in addition , there is a personal type of read performance in tex@@ tual or last jump @-@ brand . this jump @-@ brand does not show this jump @-@ mark , so that they will automatically take part in the first input of a character .
the editing is probably one of the main effects of a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; though . &amp; Kate ; they have many different environments and groups , and so many different environments . &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; special commands for their selection . among other editing , the following commands are included in the text area .
pre@@ disp@@ ose of a complete paragraph ( group of lines , which included on both sides ) . with sales in paragraph , it &apos;s not only a text that can be separated from the source text . the only differenti@@ ation thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; therefore , the only differenti@@ ation thing in &amp; k@@ ile is therefore , that the fold wra@@ ps are separated by two le@@ iss@@ ors lines .
pre@@ fix the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command can also be found &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; -@@ commands with an additional star ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
the key line of a document can be nat@@ ured . &amp; Kate ; the key line will be removed . &amp; k@@ ile it offers its own commands . &amp; k@@ ile it offers its own commands . in editing , the following commands are included in the following commands :
remo@@ ves a complete paragraph . the definition for a sales in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of edit menu .
it has already been clear that environments is a key role in &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; therefore , n@@ f offers other commands at the environment for a fully functional , simple work with &amp; L@@ ate@@ x .
this command will be placed at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the environment .
this command will be placed at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to the suspension .
if the cur@@ sor is before or within the result \ \ &apos; { environment } is located at the end of the surrounding area ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
when entering many se@@ ach@@ able ambient damage , the order can quickly be lost quickly . this command would be the most recently crossed environment , so that the f@@ ach@@ able environment structure did not be broken off .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; group , which are determined by cl@@ amps of { ... } . in editing Te@@ X Group are some important commands that meet with editing environment .
this command will be placed at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the spot@@ ted bur@@ ners .
this command will be placed at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the par@@ rots cl@@ adding .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the par@@ cel of a &amp; tex ; group # is , it will be spec@@ kl@@ ed at the other end of the group ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
when entering many f@@ ach@@ able groups , groups cl@@ amps can be lost quickly as quickly as a result . this command can be found in the most recently renovated structure of the &amp; tex &apos; structure ; groups not cr@@ ushed up .
in &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; two simple instructions for the purpose used to be used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; is used . however , the sign &quot; is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; he knows this case and for two sle@@ eves for the shooting of ¼ r &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ;
this automatic system for double bonds , can be found among settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X , and will be marked .
there are also many other languages ( such as n@@ ymp@@ h or French ) and therefore German or French @-@ speaking countries can be used . there are also many more languages for more languages .
in the plain of Shift ; input button for scrat@@ ches &amp; k@@ ile ; if the current position within a lists -@@ environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ emi@@ ze ) is , for example , not only a tooth breaks , but at the same time the command \ \ item .

even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; intelligent enough to be set @-@ set &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; - or user @-@ defined environments on the individual . these k@@ itt@@ ens are added under settings of col@@ ile ; ... La@@ Te@@ X will be added .
some users change the columns in tables environments , and so all E@@ t signs ( amp ; ) ; in order to make it possible . although this tab@@ ulator is not the appropriate position in the following line . even though this Tab@@ ulator is not possible to put up a couple of intermediate space for the columns position of the current Tab@@ ul@@ ators .
though &amp; Kate ; although it has already been installed in &amp; k@@ ile ; these have already been installed in &amp; k@@ ile ; these are three different modes of work . these are three of these are the fully automated pr@@ un@@ ic@@ ing system . all these modes are set to be set up in one of these modes .
at the beginning a new environment via the command of \ \ &apos; { environment } is automatically as@@ ile ; automatically order \ \ end { environment } after an empty row ( for the text ) .
when running the key button , the last letter of the input will be removed and fitted to the fully automatic price list . on the other hand , the list can also be sc@@ aled by input of a further letter .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively the descriptions are nat@@ ched by &amp; k@@ ile . alternatively , you can also be able to make up this positions using edit Spr@@ ung@@ brands N@@ Ã © annual spr@@ ints , and the washed parameters will then be included .
below the col@@ ile ; read the entire space settings on these lists . there are various guest lists for &amp; tex ; - und &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; -@@ commands and W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ arities of the general language used .
the following mode is a lot of letters with \ \ &apos; s , and it is always used a large number of letters with an ambient mode . on the other hand , they are so often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; one special mode for the complete operation of the environments is used .
when used to make use of the menu or the button button , the order button will automatically be done automatically , and it appears as \ \ &apos; . afterwards , the ambient temperature can be res@@ um@@ ed to sim@@ pl@@ est way and finished by filling the input button .
after this is being closed , the environment will be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognizes that there is a lists for a lists that is even a first \ \ item command .
under settings k@@ ile ; read the fully @-@ up settings to these lists . this mode uses the complete list of the fully @-@ purpose mode for sale / tex ; - und &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; -@@ commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; well @-@ known custom lists of departure , which can be replaced immediately by pressing ton@@ n@@ uns . in example , the lists can be used for ex@@ amp@@ het@@ c@@ w@@ l file , for example , the L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X entry is included .
for example , the letter L will be added and the word fully @-@ complete mode , or the button Ã ¼ r Str@@ ong + Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste , the letter L will be replaced by the drawing \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large number of rooms are not helpful . however , it has been found that many whales were written in a document over one more than once . so , &amp; k@@ ile it has already been written for sale .

the dialog graphic entries are designed for graphics , just like fully @-@ like . to display the foundations of the foundations for the graphic formats , the sections should be considered .
PS @-@ files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for work@@ outs and re@@ members of the pages . the PDF files are re@@ arranged by a few &amp; post@@ script . they are re@@ arranged and then converted to a pdf @-@ file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
in order to create the result of work , the source code must be compiled in the source code . all of the tools are marked in the menu of creation , comp@@ resses and conversion view .
for the comp@@ ile of the source of the spring , as well as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or another conversion can be used via Alt ; 3 , it can be found with Alt ; 4 the DVI / O file into a PS file , converted into a PS file , and it can be seen by Alt ; 5 the PS file is considered .
when using the module quick @-@ construction , the viewer is usually called for the compression . should not be used , it will always be possible for each new window .
a new project will be required for the new project new project .... &quot; the following information about the project would be asked for the project :
when using the fil@@ en@@ ames -@@ F@@ enst@@ ers , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r Project file .
the script @-@ function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the shooting of the EC@@ MAS@@ cri@@ pt from the scripts . the scripts inside the scrip@@ tions in vertical bodies are managed .
the API scrip@@ ting are not yet developed and moved in further versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; even more .
as the first one must be said that the scripts for the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a native object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; a rather open system , in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; provides a lot of varied assistance to the individual sector of users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; they are supplied with many documents . in it , there are a documentation for the packages and another &amp; L@@ ate@@ x .
there is not only a completely new version of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is ideal for searching for a specific form . there is a very large document which is very large , it will be divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; in three important read signs .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application texts is always easy . to make a database with all too &amp; k@@ ile ; delivered documents and in this area , it has a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the pri@@ stine advantage is the search for package name or stroke . of &amp; k@@ ile ; then the results are displayed .

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains a lot of new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all of these tools use comp@@ ile as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ sl@@ t as lower . the combination offers fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who worked with the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentary programs , knows it is a piece , we give it a graphical user interface ! not more on a terminal ; easy to use the symbol for the XML processor and finished !
this application offers a index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the file . when index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in ge@@ ered working boxes , then let it remove the current working class file . if not , they remove the selection of current working file and give them a file in the field of other file .
output files are stored in the same file as the source code . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time every time it is started .
as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentary shows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there is now a great graphical user interface .
if the straight open file index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then it is simply the current work file . if not , then they select the current work file , and give them the file , where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an issue on the screen , your file is faul@@ ts . please check the errors and try it again .
if this is an error file is marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; then they let them simply beat the current file . if not , delete them with current file , and select the file @-@ controlled file by other file - file selection .
if you want to know if the VCD file is well @-@ format , click the Well @-@ based review selection .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; that is specified in &amp; XML ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ; &amp; XML ; scheme for the Rel@@ ax@@ N@@ G review is the specification of the Defin@@ i@@ tions UR@@ I ; in the file selection is required .
probably , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the working file in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus should be selected , then they can select the current file simply . if not , remove it the choice , and select the file &apos;s selection by using the other file &apos;s file selection .
to give it the name of the file , as the result is supposed to have a result . the file is usually stored in their home file .
the plu@@ gin , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is possible to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; so you can &apos;t wait until someone can benefit the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements can be found .
to install a plu@@ gin or a plug @-@ in , we start to edit with the menu Help . thus the following dialogue is open :
this dialogue allows you to manage all the plug@@ ins , and add new to them . we describe every &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without any storage location or qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path leads to the search of plug@@ ins .
often work on a project several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the team members and these can be configured with Shift , F@@ 7 project project @-@ properties tab .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user &apos;s name and serves to a clear identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team manager and sub@@ project leader .
the user can be looking for yourself from the list of te@@ amm@@ ites , who is done . this is done by playing the te@@ amm@@ ite and the button S@@ etze . currently , the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears to be fat after you are : text .
nick@@ name and the setting of its own identity are important for news and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to the overview of their team there is an additional advantage by recording of members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team manager if something specific is . see also in further information .
event actions are being carried out that if something specific in the project is done so that later , how much someone is working , or if a file is saved , or a script that will play a file into CV@@ S , as soon as they will be added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the side configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , can be processed and deleted .
an e @-@ mail address will be broadcast on the receiver in the receiver -@@ list . the address can be a team or sub@@ project head . see also , the head can be set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comment@@ aries by the following things :
comments may be simply . it can be either the note -@@ record from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key word in a commentary area followed by comments text .
comments on the team &apos;s syn@@ tax rate ( top name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , and top name of the team &apos;s head is the team manager for the project head and sub@@ project management should be led as if in the following examples are below .
nick@@ name and rolling names are independent of large or small , but no spaces around the cl@@ amps , and the note : make the note .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scripts and mol@@ ds languages , the DT@@ D @-@ based and web @-@ based form@@ att@@ ing and scripts responded .
the settings are easily accessible via the settings . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for which can be found in .
the settings can be called by using the Qu@@ anta . Dies@@ er@@ dialogue extends over some pages , which are treated with each other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; concerning tags , including car , can be changed . the entries are :
large / small entry from tags : large / small transfer of automatically en@@ acted tags . normal Great / small entry means tags will be added to the tags , as they are described in the day XML files .
large / small transfer from At@@ tri@@ bu@@ ten : large / small transfer from automatically compens@@ ated At@@ tri@@ ck . normal Great / small means , the attributes will be added to the attributes such as they are described in the day XML files .
optional tags : if ange@@ ha@@ ze , you will optionally be available for tags , which is optional immediately after the exclusive day .
not optional tags : as top for all other tags , except for easy tags .
start @-@ up Day automatically update : if switched on , the corresponding day is changed and vice vers@@ a .
automatic acc@@ ent of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic change of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters in the corresponding code during the en@@ ti@@ pp@@ le .
M@@ IME type : M@@ imet@@ ric types to detection of different types of files . using the standard standard , the standard settings can be restored .
standard drawing enco@@ ded : the encoding of new files or in other way than with file opening @-@ open files ( where the coding of the file can over@@ sees ) , however , this setting is loaded by the same in the project features , if a project is charged .
standard @-@ DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is loaded by the same in the project features , if a project is charged .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; created regular backup copy , so in a stream@@ line or crash when the next start of the program can be restored . that &apos;s not the same as the memory of the file . even for not even stored documents , a backup is created according to the specified time .
the preview of the documentation can be presented either in the Edit@@ or@@ field or an own view ( or the documentation in a cart@@ ons ) , which makes it possible to look the documentation , preview and the source code simultaneously .
set the window settings to the standard back to the next start , when the user &apos;s interface has come across the M@@ DI @-@ Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views from each other . it equ@@ ates the --@@ res@@ p layout parameters .
the warning line is serving the taxes of the ability to attack the indication of war@@ nings by no longer .
the place is to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can also change the display of symbols instead of scrip@@ tions as well as the synchronization behavior of V@@ PL@@ - and the source file view in the shared mode . regarding the different modes , see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure of the structure , which the picture of the Par@@ ser @-@ node in the document , can be set up in details .
in the mouse click on the structuring of mouse , the following action is possible to modify the action by pressing the structure with the mouse button .
in the area of Stru@@ baum @-@ settings , visibility of node in the tree can be automatically opened , the empty areas are automatically opened in the text , while empty groups are not found in the text , while empty groups are not found to be found in the current document .
a short@@ ened type of templ@@ ates ( a type of templ@@ ates ) , which can be read in editing with an extensive text . this means that it can be a valid Group for PHP , which means that the i@@ f@@ ool will be somewhat different than in a group valid for Javas@@ cri@@ pt .
here , the plug @-@ ins can be re @-@ installed . plug@@ ins are in @-@ use of the third page , that can be re @-@ used by each K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , on the most famous &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; when creating a plug @-@ in , you need to be specified :

input : this information will be handed over to the start , so it can open the current file , the file sharing ( path of the current file ) or the repository .
component in &quot; Only @-@ L@@ esis &quot; mode : check if the plu@@ gin ref@@ uses to store the store . only @-@ L@@ esis @-@ K@@ Parts is usually put the charging when this option is not selected .
check the Plugin : is this enabled , then tested &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the correct information is correct . pick up the memory of the contract , then if the plu@@ gin is not available if the plu@@ gin is not available , but it is later to be installed .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the error is completely re @-@ developed . the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set up , such as the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a Deb@@ ug@@ ger plu@@ gin is implemented , which allows various implement@@ ations of plug@@ ins .
currently only a plu@@ gin is available to use and add support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; pl@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserted .
the use of the Deb@@ u@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a matching Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . with the schem@@ atic options in addition to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plu@@ gin , the specific settings can be changed .
if for a project , Deb@@ ug@@ ger is activated , some additional elements in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view that will appear in the content of excessive variables . usually , in the left Do@@ ck .
a view , in which all holding points , are listed and conditions listed . usually , usually in the lower do@@ ck .
a view , shown in the edition ( like in HTML ) of the Deb@@ u@@ gger . usually in the lower do@@ ck .
depending on the supported functions of the Deb@@ u@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this promotion , the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger , if necessary , it will be used by plu@@ gin . this action is triggered by default , if a project is opened , which will not be used by Deb@@ ug@@ ger , so that it must not be used in normal case .
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session Star@@ te the session . closes the link to Deb@@ ug@@ ger or end to the requirements .

this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to your needs and how you can adjust &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to get better .
document type Edi@@ ct ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; capabilities to make support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scripts ; skills and flexibility made of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a quick , user friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the brand @-@ up languages and family 2 , the file @-@ file and the tool . day @-@ files are handmade , symbo@@ lically set for image sheets ( above the Edi@@ tier F@@ enst@@ ers ) , the text and instructions may add faster into a document as a user .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be upgraded ( see below ) , downloaded and automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see also for details regarding the transformation .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to create , then the &amp; gam@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bar . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ alo@@ es ; the file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool bar allow a fast check of tags in a document without any danger of writing .
day @-@ folder are nothing as a file . they only contain the file @-@ files and the day files . day @-@ file carry the names of the labelling language and version , such as ( for example , ht@@ ml @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below the elements of the Tag@@ XML on and de@@ kl@@ ari@@ ert whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is wise to use it as many as possible , so many users have a better insight and more information about working with them .
the following chapter describes each element on individual element . all about the possibilities and limits will be in simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only be found in a document . it may contain the definition of many tickets , but contains only a element , but nothing else .
the type of the tags is a script @-@ function . when used by use &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only Family 2 )
only for the day Class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only Family 2 )
only for the Type Method , valid for the name of the class , where this method is part of this method . ( only Family 2 )
yes , the day has an common At@@ tribute group and the attributes within that tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialogue . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . this is a only element type element .
this element describes a attribute of tags . this element can only be set for each attribute . in addition , it contains additional tags , who describe how this attribute is displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element @-@ element element .
provides the source tex@@ te for the attributes in the day @-@ editors and in At@@ tri@@ ggers @-@ tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; will be used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method used within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; will be used to allow the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and method names . the arguments that are handed over to the method . may be empty for or half day name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container @-@ day that can be group@@ ed together with a list . it can only appear for an At@@ tribute description only once . it is a non @-@ element type element .
tables the pole position of an tags within a slide . this day can only occur within a dialogue ( for example , once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; day ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a rim in the dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) .
gives a list of elements that may be found within the defin@@ et@@ able tags . this element is a only element type .
gives a list of elements that end a day . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files have to start with an &amp; XML ; declaration declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and have to be ne@@ phr@@ ased and closed .
no spaces do not have anything else , but pay attention to &amp; quot ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced . this is no leg effect , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to review the Tag@@ XML files , the tools can start up in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and over@@ lap Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ X . another dialogue is set to follow , its simple instructions is to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the verification is only available at the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in the following example , for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file , this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the file name for this day @-@ XML file is supposed to be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ charge function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ util@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; Class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / days &gt;
the &amp; N@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is quite simple and there is an editor to be connected via DT@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite DT@@ D settings ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it should be prepared using a simple &amp; re@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with following entries are prepared :
&#91; General &#93; version = Use de 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN ) . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional ) . if not stated , the name is used as a Nick@@ name .
a promotion can be used with settings . click the new Action for the same dialogue :
the button but@@ ton@@ 1 can be assigned to the button . using the button , button 1 can be assigned to the button .
the easi@@ est actions . it may be given a text in the det@@ ach@@ able settings and will add this text in the document on the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful role of action . with the help of this action , external applications can change or used as input ( or parts of the document ) , you can change examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the Schnell@@ start dialogue or the various Behold in ... promotions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EP@@ s .
as first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified Pf@@ ade is allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ ances : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / Scri@@ pts from their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced the URL of the current document . in case of a local document it is removed : / from the document name .
% pid : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text is made to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP to control of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , will be used by external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the reposit@@ ories .
in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; at the standard settings can be determined . in the selection field , you can send to the standard settings . options are :
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only with this setting .
according to the input , the issue of the completed application can be published . there are two types of issue : normal edition , which is written on the default issue . it can be specified in which the default issue will be specified by using the value of the selection issue :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool for each group . in the case there are not too many , therefore one can create a tool with the name of the market .
once a tool is added , you need to add and configur@@ able promotions . select the action plan .
the parts of this feeding are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action Kn@@ op@@ ter at the lower end of the F@@ enst@@ ers starts the editing mode .
fill out all necessary fields and add it the day for the suitable tool bar .
complete everything and if the day attribute its use , and you plan to make your use , activate the dialogue &quot; Day , &quot; if you are using the promotion to the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is it an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this icon ? if we replace difficulties before we have difficulties .
for creating a symbol@@ ise that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ do ; choose from the &amp; k@@ men@@ ; , graph More ( or where else it is located in the distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ do ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel , we need 22 x@@ 22 pixels . to change this , select black .
please note that the symbol symbol not only helps you to remember what the promotion is doing , but also all the other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
in mind that the day start , I decided to create a starting button as the symbol of green ( green is usually defined as rigid , rigid , further ) , or should at least , a message to the users , click here . this symbol will add a &amp; lt ; started on day in the current document .
after the creation of the symbols needs to be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with settings ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . in addition to the text box is a button , press it .
if you choose the file , in which the stored symbol is stored , select it and confirm you with OK .
press the kno@@ b kno@@ b and put them with other tags , so there is what are , or confirm you to complete with OK .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ functions for a better view , or it should be shared this to better overview through some Tren@@ ner in several groups . open the tool bar about the tool bar . make sure the required tool bar is selected .
I would like to select the Tren@@ ner ( very left above ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element that will be added to the tool bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to the tool bar .
I would like to add a quick opportunity to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I &apos;ll choose it and add to the tool bar .
please note , how the Tren@@ ner support the group . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool doesn &apos;t know that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button on the opposite of the start @-@ button .
the new tool bar must be tested by using any symbols , to ensure everything works .
you do not exist in the correct folder , but your tool bar should be stored in the right folder , but your tool bar should be loaded in the right file , so that your tool bar will be loaded ( n ) , if a file is open from the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language , which you like to do it . hence , this chapter describes a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory , if someone has done for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ ulas / Sk@@ ri@@ pt / etc . then , you have to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we left you , we treat the second .
# 5@@ 2.@@ ht@@ ml Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ ht@@ ml Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ ht@@ ml Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ ht@@ ml Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ ht@@ ml Division 2 = par @-@ 1.@@ ht@@ ml @-@ 1 = tag@@ m@@ ht@@ ml @-@ 2 = daily 2.@@ ht@@ ml @-@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ ht@@ ml
the tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c &#93; = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level : Top Level = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = Basic Re@@ ference = basic syn@@ tax , ... Basic syn@@ tax = tri@@ age@@ .@@ basic syn@@ tax . ht@@ ml ...
note the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Re@@ ference . this shows that there &apos;s no known border with its own content . there is no known border for the chess tel@@ es ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it even .
note that the table of contents directly on one file &apos;s refer@@ enced ( and consistent , at the upper end of the construction work &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
no spaces do not affect anything , but pay attention &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resources c@@ end@@ at@@ eries will be replaced .
the content section is the range of do@@ cr@@ c _ fet@@ ch _ array function . for example , when writing a writing tool . there are only two types of entries here . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and file types .
a simple list of by using a separate background elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then , in the same file such as do@@ cr@@ c , and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure , you will send your do@@ cr@@ c files with an description of important information , for example , documentation uses to be used by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory . you will not be rich , but we are proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they are not alone anymore . it is possible to divide the Resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool bar with actions , scripts , templ@@ ates ) with other places . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent to friends , partners , or else to whom are sent . in different places , there is an email address , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool menu from files and folders in the templ@@ ates and in the scripts .
the resources can be done in our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download and make use it as correct , for which it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origins of the resources will be ensured , both for our team as well as the later user .
when you invite you to the pas@@ sp@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case you will have to pass a look for you . in the dialogue New Resource must be filled ( URL preview , empty ) , and with click from OK .
the port can download from the menu DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) to upload , tool@@ bar tool bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templ@@ ates and scripts .
after downlo@@ ading of an resource , even before the installation , the integrity and Sig@@ nific@@ ance . in the case of problems , please note the warning messages . if the integrity and the resource has been signed , appears a message with the author of the resource .
it &apos;s possible to work on XML languages by using a D@@ TE@@ P package . however , the creation can be more complicated because hundreds of day files in day@@ XML format could be needed . there is a simpler track to convert a DT@@ D to a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D store and conver@@ sions to a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . afterwards the following dialogue :
objective name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p file .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE defini@@ tions : the character set which is released ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE day , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / alt@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d should be released .
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if activ@@ ates , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after the conversion of the new &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , you can be adapted to the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . it is recommended to use this opportunity .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there is some key concepts . in order to understand these benefits and full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this chapter has to place them with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to accommodate these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little use brow@@ nish .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the work area has divided into three areas : global , locally and projection , this differenti@@ ation concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is available in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it enables the group of administrators in a global tree to secure actions and patterns in a global tree that will then be available in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements provide a personal collection of web development for a single user . these are custom @-@ specific pattern and tool@@ bar . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user .
project @-@ based elements are available only within a specific project . this can be used for the files of a specific project . simply , this is the most restricted size . all elements are put in the files of the project , which means common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editors window , the construction site , the Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ ites with info and the tool bar . please turn in , and for further information about these areas .
you can get the card @-@ in with the right mouse button to get a con@@ figure menu with the current document , such as the current , other or all card , re@@ load , delete , or return to the document , jump to a read sign or version of CV@@ S commands .
right @-@ down menu in the Edit@@ or@@ range , as well as basic handling steps ( cut / copy / copy ) , processing of the tags under the mouse , using the file named or open the file , if the character is named after the mouse button .
at the upper end of the editors of the editors are currently working &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool bar will be shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they are adapted to the new features and related user needs .
the use of tool palette is really easy . if you want to add a single day , then click the symbol which you want to enter the day . if you want a day to add several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill up several fields you can fill up several fields .
the Bau@@ man@@ ts ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate it , to open and go through . in the presentation with cart@@ ei@@ re@@ ites stand for files , project , pattern plants , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation construction .
project management is a powerful tool designed to provide &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all files in the project and allows the files to be carried out in the project with correct mouse click . promotions such as hin@@ ts , removing , removing , or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be carried out using the context menu menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templ@@ ates . almost everything can be a model : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all options open .
templ@@ ates can be divided into three categories , depending on it , in which context it can be used . global templ@@ ates are always available , local templ@@ ates only for the corresponding users and templ@@ ates in projects are only used in the project . more information is available in the project .
here you will find information about the available scripts . the concept of structure in Global , Lok@@ al and Project works here . on the left mouse button , you can find the information on a script . further functions are available , such as the script is to start , edit , edit or email .
this view is showing the internal structure of the active document . through the links section of an element , the cur@@ sor is set on the position of the element . by right @-@ up of an element , a list of commands in relation to navigation and collecting of construction .
this tree appears under the other construction views . with him , man@@ oeu@@ v@@ ing@@ ed attributes and nam@@ ing areas , which allows for the contents of all available attributes with a few mouse click on the contents .
here is the complete documentation of Web @-@ technology for your development . we can download the documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; Document of the documentation , you can create own documentation , and adding a Regul@@ atory doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two anti@@ trust in the lower end of the F@@ enst@@ ers , about the easy @-@ to @-@ use information can be reached : the news window and the problem is window .
this box is more information about each in Qu@@ anta running Sk@@ ri@@ pt . such as the used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D .
this cart@@ ons show all error in the market @-@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scrip@@ ting , which will be carried out , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work@@ manship are extensive and easy to understand . they appear on a symbol and they get the appropriate command . the chocolate site of the tool is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to define .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool with e @-@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if they get a tool bar in an e @-@ mail , you can buy this in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other secure and load !
it is reasonable if you want to adapt the site of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ files on your system . to get a complete list of options that give the con@@ figure script . to get a complete list of options to understand . / con@@ figure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand , and here are not executed .
if you have problems at St@@ arten of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 program folder , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H before their bin file is . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a Web @-@ development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines an advanced web development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while attempting to avoid the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a stand @-@ alone , exten@@ dable market languages ? well , this would make him a absolutely great web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE , making it done it .
not longer on pure and HTML ; limited , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now it is possible on the way to a general and comprehensive web tool . in addition , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; if you want to define &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for ensuring the suitable &amp; IDE ;
well , in the above mentioned that , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; however , it is not only possible that any application has been developed ? thanks to the &amp; K@@ DE , but it allows users to expand users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; so to expand as they need for their need .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it allows us to increase the productivity of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . through the program of compression , it can expand and extend them without any scrip@@ tions before you need . ( more about how to find them in . )
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web@@ development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and has been developed rapidly to an advanced Editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is connected in any way with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers made the GP@@ L license version and produced a commercial program .

a quick access list of files you have opened . this list is jed@@ es@@ mal , if you open a file , which is not on it out , with the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to store code parts and whole files when used for the future use . if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project task , only an error reported .
converted from the cli@@ p@@ board there , the special sign of the cli@@ p@@ board there is a special sign to get HTML ; -@@ let , so they appear correctly and not seen from your browser as a form@@ att@@ ing instruction .
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ note that the correct way to add @-@ of special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is . first line to add &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day .
the block@@ size is required or from . that allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; button .
goes directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; script error messages !
looking for a character or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or add with GUI and pre @-@ defined expres@@ sions to help you .
shows the news window or not . that &apos;s the window in which you see the display of scrip@@ tions and the Deb@@ ug@@ ger .
out@@ - and hole of the problem re@@ por@@ ters at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main problem . the problem re@@ porter will be activated when you arrive to the Stru@@ baum .
shows the symbols left from the main window . this column allows you to set reading signs with a mouse click .
if there are reading characters in the current file , they will appear together with the entries or the next file , depending on the position of the cur@@ s@@ ors in the document .
wire Book@@ mark out of the other hand documents are group@@ ed after the fil@@ en@@ ames of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are stored with the file with .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialogue for the files into the current project . the selected files will be copied to the project directory .
through the project directory , searching for new files that could be there . this enables , for example , graphic files in your project folder or add a sub@@ ord@@ ner and add it to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE , and whether you have any input / output modules ( Ki@@ o Sla@@ ves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects you will find the details .
charges a project tool bar . these are stored in reposit@@ ories / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialogue to save your material tool . allows you to select the type of tool bar : locally or project .
opens up a dialogue in order to add a new factory tool . they only need to store the tool using settings . they need to be saved using the tool &apos;s tool bar or you want to store the tool &apos;s tool .
remo@@ ves a tool from the visual area . the sol@@ ation is not stored by the hard disk . if you do not have the tool not stored , you would like to do if you want to do .
with this , you can send her own tool to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the tool bar will present in the next release ) . the menu item will open a new mail message with the tool bar .
enables high @-@ loading tool to the main server , where everyone can access it . see also .
download a &amp; DT@@ D ; if you made or any of any other , and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own fixed format .
download / rep@@ ay from the en@@ dur@@ e from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense when the En@@ ti@@ tes of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; however , if the global market is not present , a write permission in the global K@@ DE file is not present , delay the shop .
this menu contains a list of tags , which is available in the current working tool . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar .
allows access to the current day entry dialog , when there is one thing . this entry is always available in the menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu .
activated , or de@@ activated the intelligent entrance of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . an intelligent one means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this will be ref@@ using using work@@ manship , if this day speaks to the rules .
in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed below the above menu . ank@@ le them . ank@@ le a activated plug @-@ ins .
select the syn@@ tax @-@ mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
cho@@ oses the type of column label . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms for developing the developers . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syn@@ tax of the current document on the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries can also cause or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended , cart@@ ons mode , which is also the standard settings , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu for each open sub@@ window is enabled . with a selection of a contract , this menu is activated .
switches the display of the status bar at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main f@@ enst@@ ers respectively .
the changes in this dialogue is influenced every application that use the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browser .
the behavior of Edit@@ or@@ f@@ enst@@ ers is one of the editors of Edit@@ or@@ f@@ enst@@ ers . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; we find details .
a dialogue appears in which you can delete the entries from the tool bar or add to the series .
this should be a help according to the environment of the mouse , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as in each open source project , developers are always used to help use . if you want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , you will find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled with the best from top to below , for example , after align@@ ing the project named the whole directory structure for the rest of the project , will be completed later with Shift , F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering a name , file is automatically filled .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Project file . by default , it has set the name of the project in small letters and without any spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) .
here you can download the server address of the machine to which you want to access to local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemplary .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
when this box is empty , the default settings used to be used . depending on the setup of the remote computer it might be necessary to customi@@ ze the remote settings .
that is the folder for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default Templ@@ ates . if a common collection of files are used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is a relative path to the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default Tool@@ bar . if a common collection of files are used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows files to add files from local file system into the project . there are several files or whole file files .
this setting is great if you want to download , you want to download and change it . if you do not want to change new script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) .
def@@ endants if files that are located anywhere in the main folder of the project , should be included . if a project is based on new , not an@@ ha@@ ken .
with this option , all files and folders are indicated within the main file &apos;s and you can add a detailed selection of the ferti@@ li@@ ken .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by An@@ ha@@ ken or , by removing the h@@ ooks , cl@@ amps from the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings , which lets your work simple . these settings can be uploaded with project properties in the menu pane in the basement of Pro@@ files , or can be changed with key@@ boards . F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings meet in the project assistant and are described in . additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( square @-@ holder possible ) that will be re @-@ related to project operations such as project folder .
supple@@ mentary option to top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded on opening of the project . can be read more about reposit@@ ories .
this can be chosen by the desired Deb@@ ug@@ ger . currently only Gub@@ ed supports Gub@@ ed . more information about Gub@@ ed can be set in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plu@@ gin can be set with the switching options . in this troubleshooting , troubleshooting .
furthermore , high @-@ profile profiles ( see below ) can be set , as well as the display of a building view for the contents of the server for each profile , showing an own building view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team , project members can be added , edited or deleted , as well as a mail@@ ing list . see the details .
in the window configuration , one can add event actions to change or delete them . event reactions are executed when a previously used event , such as the sc@@ ents of a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that opened open . this behavior can not affect it .
to open up a further project , select the project or the symbol project open from the tool project or the symbol project open from the tool project . the dialogue Project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the reposit@@ ories will be stored automatically . if you are asked if you want to store changes before leaving , when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you invite a new project .
the project plans have free access to the files in the project . there , files can be managed to manage files in the current project .
file behavior , however , are missing the entries for opening and opening with ... in with the right mouse button
here , different profiles can be searched here . the profile contains information about the site of the uploaded files . see .
allows you to removing the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button ends , to prevent removing the removing .
password is checked in the core memory and with programmer . this option is useful if Sur@@ charge is necessary , and the rather un@@ certainty password on the plate is not in question .
this will stop the transfer to stop or simply take the dialogue when you change your opinion about the high load .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; many up@@ loading profile are created and so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . do not make this dialogue :
this is the name of the server , to be copied on the files . either a qualified domain name or an IP address work .
the transfer protocol for high load . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE and installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS games .
the port for transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator runs a service not at the usual port .
depending on your anxiety shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . do not use them in the plate , so it &apos;s not easy to read it , but each with programming reports it can be easily seen in Kl@@ art@@ ext .
a project view is only a set of files and tool bar . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simply exchange of view can be loaded , and replace the currently open files and tool bar .
views can be saved in the menu or project tool bar , easily accessible via the tool bar tool bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has to do on most . this helps us to increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to its own work .
as mentioned above , work tool in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best known on the menu tool bar . use and add to the menu . adding tool bar will add down in the section of adding tool@@ bar .
the tool@@ bar and symbols can be set up in which with the New Action , you can choose to adjust other activities such as tool bar , tool bar or tool bar , which can be specified in the dialogue , where actions can be visible on this or other tool bar .
using the context of the context menu ( symbol ) on a tool bar , you &apos;ll also remove the entries to remove and action , that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool bar and the actions on them can be set with settings for tool@@ bar ... and the settings are set .
templ@@ ates are available in key document skel@@ eton , code @-@ cuts and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can copy , postp@@ one or each other on the existing directory in the pre@@ app@@ liance . templ@@ ates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in approximately the restrictions you want to push for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supplied the conditions for their use . please read the conditions in front of the use on the start of the use .
ob@@ serves , everything is not available . it can be any file with text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; can be inserted in documents by linking ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / URL ) . some examples are available in advance with global templ@@ ates . additional information on the templ@@ ates are available .
documents can be created from each text document . normally , we can specify a basic documents in appropriate sub@@ folders to be efficient . some examples can be found in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples can be found among global templ@@ ates . see also for more information on the templ@@ ates .
this type of device is useful if not a new document is to be inserted into the documents . you can find everything from a comment by a final menu to Javas@@ cri@@ pt or Perl @-@ based menu . some examples are in advance below global templ@@ ates . see also for more information about templ@@ ates .
as the name says , these templ@@ ates for all the sites used as templ@@ ates . they are organized a collection of different documents that are organized in a folder structure . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are currently no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
design a document structure after exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select the file as template as local template ....
as soon as possible , note that ( even if there were saved as a project position ) the model is not visible in the project tree . look at the top of the project .
select text in your document and click on file . alternatively , you can save the selection as local / projectors . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with finish and lay on the construction sites .
the creation of bin@@ ders is simple : the file is simply copy in a pre@@ valent file . you can use all file management functions for it , such as gyp@@ sum and deposits , or add about the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can check in the file tree or in the project files for a file on a folder , and site template create a name for the model and secure . by default , the project is secured , but of course it can be saved as local or global template .
project pre @-@ related templ@@ ates . you can shape the head@@ lines , or dynami@@ cally with &amp; PHP ; design , files or with them . in addition , some things can retain some of them in the eye at a very deep @-@ depth at the eye .
the pre@@ valence structure on the ground window is based on the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / template . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as seen above .
in order to specify the behavior of a file , in the pre@@ press overview with the right mouse button on the folders and choose to choose in the context menu properties . the following dialogue appears :
a select field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templ@@ ates . this selection is ab@@ duc@@ ted , as soon as possible At@@ tribute to the attributes .
this is activated by default , and it would be checked out in this path , it would be checked out in this path , except they would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with anything like the text building . if nothing appears , you will probably be in a trunk file .
the previous text allows for pre @-@ specific head@@ lines for a specific project , enabling head@@ lines for a particular project , enabling head@@ lines in a file with special head@@ lines / foot@@ lines an entire presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ lines .
in addition , we are using the context menu ( which , right mouth button press ) on a complete command collection for the execution of folders or copy , and add the templ@@ ates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which allows the source code text by V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and second item the editors window in two parts : the source code editor and V@@ PL ; -@@ editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : he invites the document such as a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor position . then , you can download and refer to the source code editor , which carried out changes in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document ; it &apos;s not possible to edit these directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; it is not necessary to edit the source text editor . there is no plans to change these behavi@@ ors .
the second mode does not work in the source code editor as well as the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor synchron@@ ous mode . with pressures from F@@ 9 , this mode is activated , the button on the active cur@@ sor of a window into the control , whereby the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor and source code editor , can be set between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically choose between synchron@@ isation . basically , the recommendation can be set . basically , the Recommen@@ dation : a small bar@@ ter for fast computers and a big donation for slow development .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , meaning the document of un@@ visible tags in the working with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is created . this allows you to change the reduction of the Nordic Col@@ . so you can change the following :
Met@@ a @-@ tags , storing information on the document itself , e.g. stroke on internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added to the list of content , e.g. key@@ words on the column and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to add pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules on the list or delete the screen . a change of the list is exactly like the met@@ a elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it &apos;s possible to connect an external CSS style by using the file @-@ button , and select the appropriate file again .
the use of the cur@@ s@@ ors is like in a text processing , due to berries . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor inv@@ ests itself . the marking works as usual . text may be inserted by inser@@ ts and attached to a button or distance button .
the entries of the tags will be done in the same manner , as in the source text editor . it &apos;s to note that there will not be an existing tags , i.e. , when a anchor @-@ day , surround with text , each other surrounding anchor is removed .
some work tool such as tables @-@ Assistant or the lists @-@ to @-@ Assistant are de@@ activated . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , tables or lists will need to be used for the tables or lists .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of styles . in contrast to other programs , the search for certain elements is possible , and the design of the style can be tra@@ ced .

there are many graphic tools for the same . why is why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain how I have written .
the mer@@ ging was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes made at the same time . another programm@@ ers had changed much text in the same file . another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result were a lot of conflicts .
I used this program to me , but I did not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there were no evidence to the places where maybe only the changes had changed . these changes had changed to a small Alb@@ arian .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could show differences within a row and changes in white signs . later , a lot of more useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to compare the text , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board , and add him in one of the reference window .
a function that made much work was the same and mer@@ ging by folders . these function related &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a complete file @-@ browser .
it is useful if two people are independent by one piece of changes and changes . the original file ( the basis ) helps users to do with correct changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result . the screen photo shows three qu@@ ell files at the connections .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you at the same and mer@@ ging complete files . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folders :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the exact differences can be found and cat@@ ered to the possibilities of their real colour monitors . if you need frequently , you &apos;ll need to check this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ators are visible . when lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see at a look at the summary of the column in the column on the left @-@ hand side . ( no trouble more if somebody changes to changes . )
if one file is equal , and the other is differs in a row , then the color is shown , which file is different . red color means that both files are different .
if all files have the same names , but in different folders , you can facilitate the ti@@ p@@ par@@ able work by using only the fil@@ en@@ ames of the first file . example :
3 , 2 , 3 files , 3 folders , 3 files , 3 folders , 3 folders , 3 files
opening dialogue allows you to select the manual page by file name , the selection of the file @-@ browser . if you don &apos;t need to specify a third file again ; if you don &apos;t have to specify the third file , if you have the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences are carried out with two files .
if you choose a folder , select the files and mer@@ ging files . if you choose a file , if a file is chosen , for B and C , a file , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A into the two other folders .
if mer@@ ging is crossed , the input field is to be actively involved , and it is not necessarily necessary to specify a file @-@ file . you can also do this step later with the memory .
the file button opens up a dialogue with settings . here you can specify options before you start with the same / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text box . compared to this comparison , you will then select any files . in the opening stage , you don &apos;t have to select the dialog , you can simply connect the dialogue with the kno@@ b button .
you can also use Zi@@ ther and Ab@@ dic@@ ation : simply take a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let him fall over a reference window .
this thought is behind it ? sometimes it contains a file , such as they would like to create such a relatively large amount . you would need to download two corresponding files , they would like to copy it into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; and then , you can simply copy all relevant sections .
note : at the moment you can &apos;t go out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the thread of the text is supported in a reference window .
warning : some editors interpre@@ ting the brick and place of text into another program than cut and add ( instead of copying or add ) . in such case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text box , the Info line contains a different color . ( note that window is optional ) . ( note that the window is optional ) . ( note that the mouse is optional ) . ( note that the mouse is optional ) for a while , you can rest a while on the line . then , a small relief window will show the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these default settings can be changed over the settings ) .
when a difference is detected , one can distinguish themselves , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is seen in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) good .
in addition to the text , the column is indicated . in some programming languages where white characters will not be useful to see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters only are in character and comment@@ aries , for pre@@ processor and in few , rare single cases . )
the vertical line , which determin@@ es the summary column from the text , where the number source file is interrupted . if the line is activated , the line is activated , the line will be displayed on the broken rows .
the result window ( below the comparative windows ) also has a info line with inscription copy : , the fil@@ en@@ ames and &#91; Ge@@ changes &#93; when you have processed the result . usually it contains automatic processes already , but often contains conflicts .
! ! ! - all conflicts is dissolved , the memory is de@@ activated ! ! ! ! ( use the buttons Spr@@ inge at näch@@ stem / ung@@ el@@ ö@@ sten conflict around the remaining remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparative windows , each difference is used at the same time a conflict of the manual must be solved at the same time .
by clicking on the left mouse button in one of the window is displayed in the windows , where the group is displayed in windows , where the group will not be visible . ) This group will become the current group of background colour for current area and to the left a black beams .
sometimes , there is no more line in the group . then , in these lines of the text , you will change your mind and perhaps again a other source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marking , you might have to copy it and weighed differently .
the text &amp; be set ; however , in the cli@@ p@@ board , however , appear in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you want to copy such text from the result window . go wrong with this function .
note : if you select the options to ignore the options are ign@@ oring or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are treated like white characters .
this will navigate to the screens and the mouse , but you can also use the arrow . if you use in a window , you can also use the arrow guides you to other programs , as well as you can use it from other programs . you can also use the vertical column next to the vertical screens .
in the eye window , you can also use the other keys to edit . using the insert button , you can change between inser@@ tion and trans@@ mitting mode . ( pre@@ set is set @-@ in mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ i@@ zes the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section and the ed@@ itable output window ) .
the work@@ manship contains seven buttons to the current / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down to Str@@ ong @-@ above ) , or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ g @-@ picture above / Str@@ ong @-@ above ) , even after the manual dis@@ solve as a conflict . therefore , it must be distinguished between the sol@@ ves and un@@ question@@ able conflicts .
to copy the mark into the cli@@ p@@ board , you have to copy the copy of the button . if it is activated , whatever you must mark the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual head . be careful with this option , because you might write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board may be mistak@@ enly deleted .
Z@@ eil@@ ing is stored in accordance with the ground@@ breaking system \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the copy of the source code files , you should not use the source code files , you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; even with bin@@ o@@ files .
the options and the list of the most recently used files are stored automatically and restored with the next start . ( menu adjustment - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
select a writing with a solid width . ( in some systems the dialogue also provides information with variable width to choose from , you should not use this . )
if you activate these option , differences are shown in cur@@ ative scrip@@ tures . if the chosen scrip@@ ture doesn &apos;t support this representation , nothing happened .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colours could not be displayed in their pure form . but at these systems , the button is automatically an odd color .
when this option is activated , the respective of the tab@@ ulator button will be added to the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator is inserted .
if you press input or Return , the final row will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is activated , any selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . manual copy into the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can choose which Z@@ eil@@ le type , you prefer to use it . the pre @-@ set value is the general selection to the operating system used .
at the same step , you tried to find white characters 3 ; first , all of all identical lines are ignored . in this step , the second step is ignored every row . in this step , the white signs are ignored . also in this step , the white signs are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) you can look at the end of a row , but then files with different sizes are available ; however , if this option is enabled , you will have a white signs , but as a white sign will be disabled . however , this option must be de@@ activated . in the default setting this option is de@@ activated .
in the default setting this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . however , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
in the default setting this option is de@@ activated . changes in commentary are treated like changes in white characters .
intense after smaller differences are looking for smaller . the option is activated in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in the Autom@@ ated @-@ pass mode , this setting defines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next ung@@ o@@ sts continued conflict .
sol@@ ves automatic conflicts in white signs by the chosen file as a source . ( pre@@ set is manual ) . if you are not only available from time , then use the automatic selection of conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options are ign@@ oring or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments .
these options will be treated in Chapter for scanning of folders and conduct a mer@@ ging . look for details under the documentation for the directory comparison and mer@@ ging .
if a file is stored and already exists an older version , then the original version used the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original file , when such a back@@ up@@ file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original exists , it will be deleted without further backup .
adap@@ ts the language of the user &apos;s user . you must end &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; finish and restart the change is active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language will be set there over the control centre . )
the following code settings can be adjusted for every entry separately . if you activate these option , you will be used for all the top setting .
about the selection fields for the coding appears a short note which the local code is . ( this can not be modified here and has an informal character . )
fit the file for source code to source code . this affects such as special characters and interpre@@ ters . because the encoding for each file can be adjusted individually , can be compared to files with different co@@ si@@ can .
if you have a file , you can design@@ ate here , which should be used , encoding the encoding .
if you want to define pre @-@ processing , you could not work with your codec . ( for example , your files are 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the device command can only use only 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can design@@ ate the coding of pre @-@ processing output .
to switch this , in order to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting changes in white characters in text or suggestions . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ign@@ oring or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments . )
this selection is available only if you have three files . in normal mode , you can see the differences between two or three files . if you are looking for A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; lt ; C or B &amp; B ; C or B &amp; B is provided . in addition to the normal still a second over@@ lay column with the necessary information .
sometimes you want to use the available room on your screen for long lines . Bl@@ end you simply use the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arran@@ ges the comparison of other lines as well as each other . this can also be useful to advertisements of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you can see the differences and select the files . a simple click starts to take the file and uses the fil@@ en@@ ames of the last source file as a pre@@ set name for the file &apos;s file . ( if this function is used to restart the mer@@ ging again , then the name of the last used file is retained . )
when reading a file , it will be given first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the issue of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which is precisely your needs . for example , this function can be cut @-@ out parts or the correct this function .
when reading a file , it will be given to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the issue of the command is used . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which meets exactly your needs . each input line must have an additional issue line .
the thought behind it is that users can allow more flexibility when developing the di@@ ff results . but most users would not need a external program , and most users would like to program this message . however , the good news is however , that in most cases , or per@@ l totally out .

the pre@@ processor commands are very useful but as with each function , the text changes or differences hidden , you may acci@@ dentally &apos;t notice certain differences and in the worst case .
you often have to edit programmer in a file so many files . for this reason , you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete file @-@ recur@@ sively and summari@@ zed .
... does it take a sugges@@ tion for any object ; you can adjust the sugges@@ tion before the start ,
... can simul@@ ate simul@@ ate and shows the simul@@ ated changes , without they really do ,
... performs selected action either with all ( F@@ 7 @-@ key ) or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 button ) ,
this is very similar to the same and mer@@ ging of individual files . you need to open only folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are related , the file is used as a base . if no goal is specified , it uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; files are specified as a target file .
note that only the comparison of files automatically starts , not the mer@@ ging . to start the link , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . )
while the folder informs you a small news window over the current progress . if you break the scanning of the file , only the files are listed , which were compared to then .
if the scanning of the file is complete , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list of windows with the results on the left , ...
each file and each folders during the scan was shown here in a tree . you can choose a object with a simple mouse click here .
the files is usually assembled in a folder , by clicking the + / - click on the object double or by adding the arrow keys to the left / right . the menu menu includes two functions of sub@@ directories , and all sub@@ directories - that allows you to cover all folders and check out .
if you click on a double click , the file comparison will start and it appears as a reference window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the date type in the first file ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type in the other files is differently , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane . in such case the conc@@ ise watch can not be selected automatically . if the mer@@ ging start is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as in the above picture , in the columns A / B / C the colours red , green , yellow and black .
however , in identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries are different .
files are identical as the same as its whole content is identical . then , file also have the same color . when files , the age is un@@ significantly intended for its color .
the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colours reflects the colours of a leaf@@ let , then yellow will then be yellow and later when it is old , red is red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy from C ( or if C not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not a : copy of A ( or if it doesn &apos;t exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C not the same date type ( e.g. A a file and B one file is ) : mistake : conflic@@ ting data types . as long as such are faul@@ ty objects exist , the mer@@ ging are not started .
... A and B did not have the same date type ( e.g. A file and B file is a file ) : mistake : conflic@@ ting data types . as long as such are faul@@ ty objects exist , the mer@@ ging are not started .
mode for synchron@@ isation is active when only two folders and no explicitly stated target file , and if the option is synchron@@ ize with the option . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action out , so they are identical to both folders .
... A and B exist , but not identical : mer@@ ging and the result in both folders . ( the user look at the visible file name only B ; directly after the con@@ forming &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are required , the date of the files and the newer file is required . however , the files are different , but the same date will have an error message : files are different , but the date is identical .. sol@@ ves such mistakes can &apos;t be eliminated .
as a result , a file is looking away , if the mer@@ ging is successful after the mer@@ ging it was successful , and according to other messages , if the merge is completed , you should see a last review , and see if the status is everywhere in order .
if in the setup dialog , the file comparative method is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will show more columns . these contain the number of verteb@@ rates , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts only appear if three folders compared to or together . )
you can either lead either the selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) either , or all entries in once . if you have chosen any additional watch actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) you can start .
please note : if you don &apos;t have any target file , then in the Three @-@ file @-@ merge C is used as the goal of using a two @-@ file merge , B is used as the target and in the synchronization , A and / or B is used as a goal .
if you have a target file , please verify that all entries should be displayed in the target file , even in the folders . there are some options by certain entries can be over@@ clock . check these options for un@@ compromising surprises :
to meet all the entries : choose the directory start / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key / button ) to take advantage of the current element : choose promotion of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if caused by conflic@@ ting data types always , a message appears to exist on the faul@@ ty elements . you can choose to select a valid action for them .
if you perform all entries , an analog window with the options have to simul@@ ate , simul@@ ate and break .
then , if you want to see what you would like to see what really the changes are made , you will get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then , certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( together a single file ) , then a mer@@ ging window ( please note the screen photo ) .
when you &apos;re done with a file , select the directory @-@ assembled directory start / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you are still not stored , a corresponding dialogue is continued . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue his work with the next entry .
when &amp; B diff@@ 3 , you will see a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you can try to take the cause of the problem . so you have the possibility to select another action on the entry or to solve the problem to any other way , before you continue to continue with the connections .
if some entries have been put together , it must not count all the entries in the recent session , but if here the mer@@ ging are not stored , or not stored , these entries are considered to be done . only if you change the connections , these entries are again assembled .
the menu menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ merge with these options :
only files that are displayed in the elem@@ ental area . it can be given a pattern with a semi@@ col@@ on ; . valid space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . file must not correspond to this pattern .
files and folders are indicated by this pattern , you can &apos;t use the semi@@ col@@ on ; as a partition : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders are indicated by this pattern , you can &apos;t use the semi@@ col@@ on ; as a partition : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
ignored files that are ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ matic files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this files are specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files are hidden in some fil@@ esystem . in other fil@@ yst@@ ation , one file is hidden . this option lets you decide whether this files are indicated in the element tree or not . this option is switched on in the default setting .
when links to files : if the option is out@@ dated , symbolic link is compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to the links . this is activated in the default setting .
in case of links to files : if the option is set off , the links are displayed and recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; the option is switched on a file for yourself and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; short@@ ened . ) This option is out@@ dated in the default position .
performs an complete analysis of each file and shows the statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ dered , un@@ ic@@ als , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when they are used on files that do not contain a text . ( give an appropriate one of the anti @-@ patterns . )
if you compare great file on a slow@@ down network , it might be faster , just the change date and the file size . however , this speed limit is due to safety . please use it with caution . this option is in the default setting .
similar to the change of change , there is no real comparison . these files are as identical if they have gone up equal . however , this option is going to be worn out . please note with caution . this option is in the default setting .
activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ize mode if two folders are specified , and no goal is specified . in this mode the results are identical to the files are stored in both folders . this option is stored in the default setting .
if there is differences , the copy of the newer file is proposed as a action . ( this is considered un@@ certain , because it is not altered that the other file is not changed . you should check this in any case . ) This option is out@@ dated in the default position .
if a file is replaced by a file , or deleted , the original version was renamed . if an old backup file is removed with the .@@ original file , this does not require further backup . this option does not only implement the appropriate file . this option is switched on the default setting .
usually , the file @-@ lead @-@ view dates back to the con@@ form of single files . if you don &apos;t want to change the window with the mouse buttons . if you don &apos;t want to switch the option directory &amp; text windows , the window on the window and text windows can be changed between the two views on the window .
probably do you prefer to compare it with double @-@ click here . in the menu , you can also use the file &apos;s current file . as soon as you save the result , the status is done on done and the file will not be combined again , if you restart the files .
this status is lost , however , if you read the directory once again : directory menu : new .
K@@ DE supports network transparent with help from Ki@@ o slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open the files that are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a file within a compressed file with a local file .
a URL has another syn@@ tax as local files and folders . some of things should please note :
a path can be relatively stable . or .. This is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolutely absolutely .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces number &gt; % 20 , etc . ) , for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file is : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes by the used protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it can &apos;t be distinguished if a link to one file or a file . then the file is always accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , FTP : ) .
there is no possibility to work pre@@ per@@ missions or change of date . therefore , the permission from the original file . ( note that the option is confi@@ dential . ) ( please note : this is only possible in local files ) .
the main users work is at present as differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op will always start the built @-@ in differences between K@@ Diff@@ ic@@ ope . then , press the right button on the differences between the differences and then select In K@@ Diff@@ ic@@ les from the context menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files are used . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the Patch file . at least one of the two files have to exist . then , you will start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the lack of file .
in the con@@ quer@@ or , you can choose a patch file preview - C@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this doesn &apos;t work if any original files . furthermore , this is not reliable , if the original files have been changed since creating the Patch file .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part of a part , it supports only the same of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge or use by files is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is compli@@ are ) there are already . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already suggests that it can lead to the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I am the GP@@ L programs already very long and have learned a lot of experience in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers that have gone or take him so .
you can &apos;t install the correct Pre@@ fix to K@@ DE and con@@ figure con@@ figure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information on this subject .
if only the number of white signs , these lines are treated as identical : if not only a non @-@ white signs , the line will be treated as a result . IF lines appear next to E@@ ach other , this is the first thing that this is the case .
editor is noticeable for every difference in the files where he begins and where it ends . that &apos;s necessary to create a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and select the result is simply as a text file , and it &apos;s a lot of effort to create an own file format , that could store this information .
so far , the effort was so far too large . you can use a certain version of a source A / B / C . in order to edit a larger quantities of the text should be used , an other editor should be used .
according to the text , No sr@@ c was suddenly ; no sr@@ c was released ; and the text does not delete them . what does it mean and how can be removed .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors as far from the differences of differences . even more high@@ lighting would be confused and missing the purpose . use it to another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . many thanks !
in order to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; K@@ DE , 3.1 or later .
information , how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , you can find on the website .
a list of the last changes will be found among htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file in the Qu@@ ell package .
to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; K@@ DE , you can comp@@ ile it and install the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ You are installed in your system in the K@@ DE file . if you are un@@ certain , you will find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .

cut the cli@@ p@@ board ( C@@ tr@@ g @-@ X or lower age @-@ removing ) . add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board , add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ ing position or replaces the current mark .
only differences : files that are identical in all files , are not in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target file .
( in the current program version , you need to change changes to these options with the function . )
there are only entries that have identical files if they are not in the target file . if the target file doesn &apos;t contain this files , if the target will not change it . ( the behavior will probably change in a later program version . ) This option is out@@ dated in the default position .
please note the buttons to choose from the source with the labelling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are at the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group ( if they are not already present ) , if the lines are already present , they will be removed back to the button .
in the default setting this option is de@@ activated . Under@@ standing in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) , these differences are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature show of all virtual working areas . it is quite convenient to modify the current programs on the work areas , to change their size to finish or to shift it . this works both within a working area and in several times .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual working areas as well as the ongoing applications . the applications can be selected , even on the working area and to other moves .
with the middle @-@ mouse button , windows can be moved within by &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible within a working area and on other working areas .
the context menu is based on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; if , in the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; if , the symbol and the name of the application , and the entries of the use as well as the entries , add Maximi@@ zer , on work surface and be@@ ating . commands :

if this cross@@ road marks , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle @-@ mouse button on the work surface and also be moved to other working areas .
when this field is crossed , the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager are displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the name of the virtual work areas .
the crossing of this rim is display the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual working areas . is it together with name show , the names are provided with file numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . work surface .
when this field is crossed , the backdrop of each work is also shown as background in the background &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
when this field has crossed , the ongoing programs are displayed as small window in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , otherwise the empty work@@ places are displayed , to make their selection .
here is a view of the program window . simply displays simple right corner with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program line . remarks : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be seen : classic p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N @-@ R@@ aster ; wa@@ its , all virtual working areas in a horizontal row , and ver@@ tically found in a vertical row , which is very well suited for the representation at the side of the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager @-@ Mini@@ Program in the control panel . it has the advantage that he can be changed in size , the windows as symbols or with their contents . it runs out outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button within by &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent select from switching the switch ... can be set up the dialogue settings .
at the moment , this cannot be changed in dialogue : you can do this , but you can do in manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ p@@ ag@@ err@@ c using any text editor like as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or you don &apos;t need to register up to your system administrator . in this file , you have to carry the key win@@ dow@@ ns transparent mode and write a value . possible values are :

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new features . it is optimised for use on powerful computers .
when you start &amp; k@@ mag ; the window is shown above . the window is displayed as large window . the picture that will be displayed in the large window , is a enlarged range of screen and is defined as a selection panel .
the standard settings can be extended into the standard setting , such as a mo@@ vable magni@@ fying . alternatively , you can also see a selected screen area in the large window unit ( a select mode ) or the surrounding area of the mouse , on the left side of the screen ( eg . on the left side of the screen ) .
please note that the mouse is shown in the enlarged window , select the attitude of mouse button . please note that , if the mouse is not able to detect the form of the Maus@@ oleum . this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; mouse @-@ mouse .
in select mode , you can adjust the selection panel to your own needs . you can change it with the arrow and mouth buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following manner :
move the mouse button in a large window , and keep the left mouse button , so you can take the contents of the enlarge En@@ tran@@ ce and move . this goes with the arrow keys .
if you are additional the &amp; Shift ; key press or the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can use the selection panel .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection panel . note that the upper left corner of the selection is remains , and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , into a file , split into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it into other applications ) , the picture turn and much more .
start or stop the updating of the display . the stops of this update causes the necessary CPU @-@ time against 0 .
select the Update rate ( Very low , low , means , H@@ och , Very high ) . the higher the current version rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode a selection panel is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; I will automatically be used to store files from files , opening of a new F@@ enst@@ ers , printing , ne@@ ul@@ aden ( with the button document again in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and cl@@ amps &amp; etc .

in order to avoid it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps to use pain , that is caused by pain that is caused by the mouse being caused by the mouse being used , and as with all ergonomic aid agents , the result can fall in each case .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitored your mouse movement and enter a mouse click , once you break the movement shortly .
is intelligent insert , turns &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ al pool ; a break after the end of the movement is carried out by the end of the movement , and you can run the mouse button . this way you can easily re@@ build a bit of exercise but you want to get spo@@ iled quickly .
this compar@@ es must be enough after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click runs .
if it is ready to go on , the turning point is ready ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set to get &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after downlo@@ ading the mouse button , before it returns the mouse button if the mouse is not done because of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; it is activated , it generates a slow speed due to the left and return to a double click . these movements will be launched in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt file ; the first time has started , but it can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can move the sound time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go on sound &amp; Multimedia , choose sound system and here the riders General , where you can adjust the sound system , where you can set a lower value to reduce the response time .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; K@@ DE ; it is currently available only under &amp; K@@ DE . in G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments please take the specific documentation to figure out how to start there a program .
all the settings are back to the opening of the di@@ alo@@ gs . have already set the button on the button , the settings are placed on the stand according to the last pressures of the application .
the best you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first of all , you should run at first . in particular , you should check out the automatic mouse click you will then take you to the automatic mouse .
if you want to use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response rates of &amp; K@@ DE , with sounds .
first , you should aware , in which places a mouse click without effect stays : the cli@@ cks on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window , which does not respond to un@@ used reactions . you can therefore use the mouse in such places , until you want to use them back .
if your mouse buttons , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the tri@@ ck is easy , that you don &apos;t want to clean the mouse , but also the roles that enter the mouse balls .
first , you need to take the mouse balls , as it is done by mouse to mouse . but it should be clear but if you need to view the bottom of the mouse .
if you have the ball , you would have to see the ball . these are in the sides of the hole , in which the ball has been used . the tri@@ ck and the pollution can easily be easily connected with a flat blade or the finger nails .
in very rare situations , the operating system has started the design of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you do not use the intelligent switch , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will not end the operation and the operation can &apos;t end up by the slo@@ ping button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using a different window manager , use a window .
the solution for this problem is that you have a mouse click . as a result , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will come back and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you enter the text , trying to run &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse cli@@ cks and sets the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : do not use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to place where you don &apos;t want to have a button on a neutral area . safe zones for mouse buttons are un@@ folded . safe zones for mouse buttons and menus and the cover lines in windows .
I try to work with the smart locking , but I don &apos;t want to edit the text .
it &apos;s an intelligent function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs to take it back to mark the cli@@ p@@ board , if you want to move into the mouse button , but if you want to move the mouse when they move the mouse button , but there will probably be a few problems here . here are some coun@@ sel@@ ections :
do not use the intelligent loading , if you only use a mouse click here . mark the text instead of a mouse click in the end of the text area . if you move the mouse button , while you move the mouse button on the other end of the text and move again the mouse button .
it is possible for every time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button is played with a sound like a mouse click . later , you can use the intelligent loading and play without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but it also needs a few exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , you must be installed , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window , must be installed on most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; set the mouse button in short . this program was developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome , and those worn in the mouth of the mouth .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to that it is a certain time that a gyp@@ sum process begins , before the mouse button will start . in this way , the mouse button can also be carried out using the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth : is a program that can talk to their computer with a silent user .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , you can talk to the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talk sets , which again be spoken .
on the first page of the assistant ( left screen photo ) , enter the order , which is later used for the language edition of text . more details can be found in the description of the setup frame .
on the second side , select the standard text matching book . from the text@@ books you can often select text pass@@ agen , without they need to be inserted . the text pass@@ ages can be processed .
on the third page ( right screen photo ) define a dic@@ tionary for the menu of the words . in addition , you can read the word lists with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org Dictionary , so it can only be included in the Wor@@ ter@@ ous words into the Wor@@ ter@@ ous words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth is clearly arranged and contains essentially a input field for button ure@@ ing of your sentences ( the lower white field in screen photo ) and a tra@@ ck@@ ling memory of the already spoken sets ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; correct , you can enter in the input field , you can listen to the phr@@ ases . each spoken sentence is wor@@ shi@@ fted on the tra@@ iling memory . you can select from this sets again to be spoken .
with the menu entry settings ; read the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialogue contains two card cards , voice guidance and settings , the page of Wor@@ ter@@ ous , as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the box bar , enter the command to a language file . in the drop down under the input field , you set the drawing player , with the text on the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two types of the text . select the check@@ box , if the text is not used as standard settings to the voice generator .
if the check@@ box is not selected , the text will be further down as a parameter . you can use the following item :
of course , the command can be sent from your language generator . this command you will find in the app@@ endi@@ x to your voice generator . examples can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with possibility to pass a voice service as a language service . if that &apos;s successful , the text is not ignored and the text on this page is ignored . the new version is available for voice guidance and is currently available in SV@@ N . the option of this option is sensible , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first select promotion to the selection of a text hand , you &apos;ll find action by key@@ boards or by choice of a text@@ book in the text@@ book text box or in the pl@@ est text box .
with the selection of so@@ fort , the chosen text box is directly spoken in and in addition to the tra@@ iling storage space . with the selection of In the input box , the elected text will initially be entered into the input box .
with the second drop down to the machining of text @-@ compatible @-@ book , you can design@@ ate whether the text @-@ compatible @-@ book will automatically be stored at the time of the machining .

the website contains a list of dic@@ tive books for Wor@@ ter@@ ous . in the main window next to the input box shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection panel if this list contains more than a dic@@ tionary . with this selection , you can choose the dic@@ tionary .
with the kno@@ bs on the side you can clear dic@@ tion@@ aries or add , the order of books , or modify them into a file . below the list , you can adjust the name and in a selection panel the language for the dic@@ tionary .
select the required language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; it reads the &amp; K@@ DE ; however , the frequency of the individual words is determined by departure of the listing . in addition , you can compare the vocabulary list with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org Dictionary , in order to add only correct words into the new dic@@ tionary .
with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then , what do dic@@ tion@@ aries have brought together , and how this should be said .
with this option , you will find a new , le@@ eres box without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; re @-@ added words automatically in the dic@@ tionary , create a dic@@ tionary with your vocabulary as a dic@@ tionary .
the main part of the F@@ enst@@ ers for processing of text pass@@ abl@@ er@@ tips are two divided . in the upper part , the text pass@@ aged books are represented as a tree structure .
in the lower part , you can work an selected entry . if you have selected a text game , you can change the text box or the corresponding key@@ words . if you selected a text@@ book book , you can only change its name .
promotions such as new text pass@@ ages or books or selected text pass@@ ages and books may be able to reach either about the selection of the menu bar , in the tool bar or a hing@@ ed menu .
the order of text pass@@ abl@@ ished or text pass@@ ages you can change with mouse to the mouse or to the right spot or with the arrow keys and Alt ; -@@ key .
the chosen text is cut out and cut into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field is a text @-@ cut , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the tra@@ pping ers .
the chosen text will be copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field is a text @-@ cut , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the tra@@ pping ers .

if this menu entry is crossed , a shift tool with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool bar can be ordered directly under the menu item directly under the menu bar . one mouse click on the narrow left side and finish , the tool bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu is crossed , this is a narrow cre@@ st in the lower part of the main thing with execution over the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not crossed , this is the status of this status .
if this menu is crossed , this menu is indicated by default , is defined as standard window with entries , directly under the tool bar . through mouse click on the narrow left side and finish , the tool bar can be moved to another place .
probably , you have not given the command for voice guidance not correct or not complete . open settings for voice messages and enter the command for the language version . ( see summary dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer . )
festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently , English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ cated . the license allowed to use the festival for free to use and without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the language issue , it is believed to be the festival in the / usr / local / festival in the file / usr / local / festival .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a compact language generator . currently , it only supports English language versions . currently , it only supports the English language version . the license allowed to use Free@@ T@@ TS free to use and without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the establishment of the voice guidance , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the file / usr / local / fre@@ eware . the voice edition is then possible with one of the three following command :
for the third example , the option must be switched on the default data . ( this is the recommended example for use of Free@@ T@@ TS use . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ ol@@ at@@ ei in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to use the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . license allowed to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax uses the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA will be installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax would like to be the last sign of the text , so that an additional signs must be added . the complete command is more complex than in the other examples :
( CAT ) ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / tmp / .@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in a row . the option will send data as a default user .
the voice issue @-@ D@@ äm@@ on of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a standard interface for voice issue . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support several voice output systems .
as the attitude of the voice is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you must only use possibility to use as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
in setting , you use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears on the site dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . you need about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , which depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that can &apos;t talk about the computers , which can &apos;t talk text by the calcul@@ ator . it is saved by a list of being saved , which can re@@ spend the user again .

before you are using &amp; kt@@ ts ; you may need to install your program can be installed and correct . see also
there are no spokesman for the first start of kt@@ ts@@ man or as long as a speaker , the card &apos;s card is displayed . see also if you have a speaker , the card map is displayed . see .
most of the T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thesizer offer different languages and votes . you can also use several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you can also use several versions for a speaker . you should use at least one speaker , before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , because the program speed can be used as standard speakers .
various spokesperson for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with a lot of printing on the same printer .
if you click on the cardboard box in kt@@ ts@@ 1 , the card &apos;s card is indicated . it will also be automatically when you start working m@@ gr and is not a speaker .
all already furnished speakers appear in this list . the preferred speaker will appear in the list . the top speaker is used for the language versions , if an application is not used .
select a mouse click on this button , click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
choose a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
choose a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to move on this button to move the speaker in the list . the order of speaker in the list will also be the priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts , system .
select a voice type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl &apos;s voice .
if you click here , check out the new speaker on the card card . to change the settings of this speaking , click on edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ons , and you can see if voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is going to see if the TS @-@ Service of &amp; K@@ DE is ready to watch text . click on the card of orders to create text @-@ orders , and manage text files .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start voice rec@@ laim from &amp; K@@ DE . click on the cardboard box General , to open this card card . here you can adjust some general options .
mark your check@@ box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops ; this is the start @-@ up menu , and you can read text orders , and you can read text @-@ orders and read text files . read the mark , K@@ TT@@ SD will be adjusted and activated the T@@ TS system by &amp; K@@ DE .
when kt@@ ts@@ man is ended , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , provided the field language issue ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is crossed .

filter for character set , offer a good possibility in &amp; kt@@ ons ; it is a good example . you can send the tags : br and b out of the news that may send fax , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , as this may be considered as required in most cases .
filter are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the normal work with &amp; kt@@ ons , filter are not necessary .
in filters , text may be processed , before being sent to the program . they are useful for improving the expression to replace false words or short@@ ened words , select a matching language and speaker , or to avoid certain defects of language syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices .
to understand the working way of filters , it is important to know how the program can works &quot; The Single Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differs four types of texts .
the issue of screen re@@ ments has the highest priority . it will be upgraded to all other orders and hold this orders again . if the edition of the screen reader is present , the orders will be res@@ ellers again .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is set to hot@@ ly reserved . a warning won the issue of messages and normal text . these orders will be res@@ um@@ ed after the warning of the warning .
please check in a very nice text . &amp; k@@ mouth : is an example of a application that can read messages . while you can read a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just ride the space . &amp; K@@ DE ; information are also news . read it .
the rest are simple text @-@ orders . each order you encounter each of the card orders , is a text@@ book . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of an application that uses the text orders . text orders are intended for the issue of an issue , which does not need any special drum@@ ming .
all four order cards are marked in waiting @-@ long , with the exception of the Screen Re@@ aders . if an application has the issue of a screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just like such an application , this issue will hold and finished .
at first , you have to know that filter has never been applied to the issue of screen Re@@ a@@ dern . you will be applied on normal war@@ fare , messages and text orders , as well as &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ news .
filter process the text and give him to the next filter . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filter are executed as modules . in the future it can still be more types of filters .
character set out parts of a text by other text . they can be used either as words or as regular expres@@ sions , allowing us to set the chat or by default or by text or for the form@@ att@@ ing messages of messages from &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; K@@ Mail ; in a better shape form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ us@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format into another format . included in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are contained in SS@@ ML .
depending on the content of text or dependent on the program , you can send the text on &amp; kt@@ ops ; if you have a female voice , a female voice set a female voice , you can read Text from K@@ DE @-@ Nachrichten on what can be read .
each of these different filter has an adjustable rules after which it will be applied for a language issue . if the filter indicates that its rules will not be able to continue the text in the next filter .
if a text@@ book , notification , warning or a &amp; K@@ DE ; notification ; it will be processed by all activated filter , which have been installed on the side down . the processing is carried out in the order from top to below .
this shows the list of the standard standard filter . is a filter not enabled , it is not enabled and is not used . filter will be used according to the top of the top .
click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be displayed below the following product di@@ alo@@ gues .
for the installation of character sets , you have to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a comparison pattern . these samples will be replaced in the text , then the text will be replaced by the relevant spare parts . large and small @-@ scale will not be used by comparison .
give you a name for your filter a name . you can choose to choose from the name of the other filter .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the character in the column and replaces him in accordance with a character set out of column . the list is displayed in the results from above .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can download a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file , that can store the current list or delete a list from one file , click the entries to the existing list .
here is a language , the filter is used here , if the spokesman for the text order is a registered version . click on the button to choose a list of the languages . you can also select multiple languages , when you enter the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button .
if a value is registered , the filter is only used when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can set several programs separately by Kom@@ mat@@ a . example : Con@@ vers@@ ation , K@@ Mail
the application ID program will receive you with the q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers have to be we@@ pt . if such as &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 can be specified , you may only be copied .
the character set is only then used on the text when all conditions with an entry in the box can be done if all conditions with an entry is empty . all input areas empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
in comparison with words , the vent@@ ing filters of regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ s Word \ \ s. The words have to be restricted to the partition ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this book , you don &apos;t find manual for writing position . if you have installed &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regulatory &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regulatory &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions &amp; # 160 ; phr@@ ases will find in the k@@ de@@ uti@@ ls .
&amp; XML ; -@@ re@@ former and XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such forms . the use of x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , it is also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
for example , you can send lyrics for a certain speaker , which is located on the card &apos;s card , or to a speaker with certain features . you can specify that lyrics of a female voice should be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ons , there is a spokesman for the text , the speaker is provided by the speaker that gives the text to &amp; kt@@ ts , and have chosen the text of the speaker . with the subject @-@ to @-@ up filter , you can write the chosen speaker .
here is a value , the filter is applied , if the text is applied , if the text is installed . it is installed on your system &amp; # 160 ; regulatory &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ tension , you can call this with one click on the button to get help when entering the input .
to achieve a faster work@@ manship , you should try to ens@@ hr@@ ise the regular expression at the beginning of the character set , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
set here the properties tab of the desired container conditions . if the text will be chosen the filter conditions , the speaker will be selected to indicate the required requirements . click on the right to indicate the dialogue representation .
use these buttons to store your search settings , or delete all the settings .
the home @-@ up filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box shows when all conditions can be used on the box . you need to carry at least one condition .
the voice output API , from &amp; K@@ DE ; , with the programmer can communicate their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications can communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; d@@ bus ;
the K@@ TT@@ SD module , which can be added with the voice syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ interface of the voice output API from &amp; K@@ DE ; the full documentation for both AP@@ Is will find on the K@@ DE ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

here is text of the text to read and option a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are no more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; window . start it only in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ man in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ compliant filters , but when using the Modul@@ s module for Festival , Web pages are not pre @-@ read .
due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you must do the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone to do so if you do not use this voice doesn &apos;t want to read web pages . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c installed and find the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain signs or inter@@ changeable characters seem to cause mistakes in the syn@@ thesizer , so all the sentences are overweight or only chew@@ ed . what can I do against it ?
make sure that the option can be set on the correct value for the appropriate language . there are problems with certain signs or words , may may be fixed through a character set filter . see .

the voice syn@@ thesizer , used by &amp; kt@@ ts , have their own license which you will find in the relevant documentation or on the respective websites . there are also votes that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ops ; it can be downloaded in the folders . in addition , you will find the source code of k@@ de@@ filed under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / dev / K@@ DE / .
includes many languages , a list of all current languages are available on the project : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / long ag@@ es.@@ ht@@ ml .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ di@@ il@@ i , Zul@@ u and Ibiza .
in addition , KT@@ TS works with each voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; con@@ sole .
the list of the above @-@ mentioned languages can be un@@ folded or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , the description of the syn@@ thesizer can be found on the supported languages . look at the web page of kt@@ ons , according to information that are not included in this manual .
the &quot; Single @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses a customi@@ zable module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to expand and expand the use of another syn@@ thesizer manual , you decide to connect with the developers team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filters is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ts , you need to comp@@ ile a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages of k@@ off@@ bs and the developers for the program .
if you are the source tex@@ tured by &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source text manual for k@@ de@@ position , or you have downloaded Tar@@ ball , translate , and install the program with the following commands :
before you are using &amp; kt@@ ts ; first , you can check if the pre @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher with your voice syn@@ thesizer correctly . you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ u@@ pt SPD @-@ conf with your voice syn@@ thesizer .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program sel@@ ector program is intended to be enhanced . the program sel@@ ector program is needed to be connected directly and the script is no longer necessary .
a long text will be disman@@ tled in single sets . the user can go down , repeat the output or break @-@ off , repeat the output or break .
if you have an application text on &amp; kt@@ ops ; if you have a speaker , you can use a female English speaker . if you want to find a speaker , otherwise it will automatically be the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ons , you can choose to see a speaker .
if you click on the card &apos;s card to add to edit , check out a speaker into the list or click on edit , the box is displayed . for example , the module is shown in the module for Festival Interactive . details can be found among the modules .
enter the path to a detailed festival program . if the path is contained in P@@ AT@@ H , you must only enter the festival .
choose the drawing of the text which is handed over to the festival . in general , this setting is done automatically . generally , Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 is used , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with this shooting , adjust volume , speed , and pitch of the synthetic language . if you are not able to select a few regulator , and this grey can not be displayed by using these settings .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes will need to be loaded , due to their size , if you have a check@@ box , this votes will already be charged with the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with larger memory consumption ) , the first set will be faster .
if this check@@ box is not chosen , you don &apos;t have a speaker ( or forget to click on the application ) .
if this check@@ box is marked with the launch of kt@@ ts@@ gr the program panel . otherwise , after the start only the icon of the system section is visible , but not the program panel . click on the symbol of the system section to show the program window .
if the check@@ box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ man is not yet , it appears in the system range , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD will read a text . thus , you have the possibility to read the possibility or sof@@ tened .
here are all orders in the qu@@ eue , together with the application that has completed the contract , the number of sets and the newly created sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the card of column ID .
with the kno@@ bs in this series you can re @-@ pass on the path which is in the list below , pre @-@ return or return . ( but not every order consists of several blocks ) .
with one click on OK are taken over to all the changes of the settings ( also on the other cardboard cards ) and kt@@ ts@@ gr . click on this icon to indicate the program windows .

here only text files are listed and manages . issues of screen re@@ ments , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . for more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ops ; you will find in .
here , select the type of audio output . if a component can not be selected , it was compiled &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate Audi@@ om@@ o@@ dul or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output . if no output modules will be displayed in the list , you will need to install at least one module , select the PC@@ M device . see also
set the speed up here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to half the half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % approximately the double standard speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program SO@@ X must be installed .
click on application to take the new settings for running &amp; kt@@ ons ; system to take over .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules built up in your system . most of them are not work . you need to find yourself that it works with you . in doubt , you choose standard .
on this card card , you can read special promotions , which will always be carried out when the text of a message is interrupted with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language versions :
the issue of screen re@@ ments has the highest priority . it will be upgraded to all other orders and hold this orders again . after the edition of the screen reader , orders will be printed again .
war@@ nings have the check @-@ in priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is set to hot . this orders will be res@@ um@@ ed . these orders will be res@@ um@@ ed after the warning of the warning .
news have the next priority . a message is in normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; if you &apos;re looking for an application that can read messages . if you &apos;re looking for a long text on a website , you can enjoy someone with &amp; k@@ mouth . however , someone can welcome you in the room .
if a word order is interrupted by a message , warning or issue of a screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the qu@@ eue a long .
this audio file will always be played , when a normal text order is interrupted . if a leading sound is active as a introduc@@ tory news , the leading sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card card is only available for normal text orders . for news , war@@ nings and expenses of screen re@@ ments there are no special actions if this is interrupted by a higher priority .
in order to read &amp; kt@@ ops ; K@@ No@@ ti@@ fy messages can be read , restart the card and click on request .
mark the check@@ box to enter the read of &amp; K@@ DE ; applications can be selected . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; does not reads any problems .
in this setting , this setting is marked , of which a sound is played , of which a sound is played , not pre @-@ read .
to add these buttons to add events on the list or delete them . if you click on the button click , a dialogue where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message to which &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; if someone mentioned in a IR@@ C message to your nick@@ name .
all events , for which nothing else is stated , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this selection panel to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; should do if an event meets the following selection :
if you have chosen custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following item :
you can enter the tab of the desired box type . standard cho@@ oses the speaker , which will be shown on the card &apos;s card as the top of the card . see also .
note that there are three levels for events there is a specific event of a specific application , this is executed . otherwise the promotion for all other events of certain application is executed . otherwise the action comes to the action , which is specified under standard ( all other events ) .
the event can &apos;t be deleted from the list ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for example , you can specify the pre @-@ information noti@@ fications as follows :
use the kno@@ bs to store the settings for the noti@@ fications of a file . if you are invited to upload settings to the events in a list . if you want to start with an empty list , click on sol@@ der . all entries are deleted from all the entries are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard , in order to mark the text and pitch of the voice and the pitch . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently &amp; kt@@ ts currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are present :
you need to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) because this default is used to use the issue of SS@@ ML .
if the settings are not set for speed or tape in the festival @-@ configuration dialogue not to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ?

there are two types of filters - normal filter and pro@@ fici@@ ent filter ( SD@@ B @-@ Filter ) . thus , the first sentence should be syn@@ dic@@ ated , not the entire text order . so you can also break back on the card of orders or jump , or jump , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not directly supported .
here you can see the stat@@ ech@@ ing filter . when the first start of &amp; kt@@ ons , it is automatically set up on the basis of a stat@@ ech@@ ing filter . you can change with settings change or other pro@@ posi@@ tional filters , though it is rounded off .
at the sim@@ pl@@ est , you can try and check the text selection , and check your text selection , and check out some features and check out the selection of the speakers . for this purpose , you have to have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then you can start faster with pre @-@ read , as only the first set can be processed , and not the whole text block , which can last long last .
you can stick to the card orders or break this function , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the standard set @-@ up filter automatically set up automatically when you start the first time . it can not be out@@ dated , just removed . change nothing at this filter , unless you know what you do .
compare the text with a regular expression of the stat@@ utes and add a Tab@@ ul@@ ator@@ um ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the set of stat@@ utes ( table code will automatically be removed from the text ) . note that the standard set fa@@ ther@@ ing filters will retain the character set .
SB@@ D filter will never be applied on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ messages ( k@@ ite ) , war@@ nings , messages , or the Edition of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern .
if you can see out the standard set @-@ value filter , you can add this again by using the _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file standard .
on the box map , you can write the search settings for use . the card card will be shown if
use of the default device ( the top of the card ) . in other words , there are no speaking properties to be specified .
use of the matching speaker , which does not delete the properties of a furnished speakers . if you choose the settings of the speakers , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker are cho@@ oses . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker from , the most important properties found in the world .
select the method for entering the desired body features by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the desired speakers . if this feature does not play any role , don &apos;t give you nothing .
mark the check@@ box if the feature pre @-@ rang up in other characteristics . you can also set several mark@@ ings here .
as the language is a critical feature of the issue , this feature is likely to use this feature . you may need this feature , if you might know that you may need the attribute , if you want to know a certain application text in a different language than that of the working environment .
to use all properties in the area , that is equal to clear , click on the select &quot; default speaker and then use the speaker , which is equal to the date .
in this case , 0 is needed for the last word order in the qu@@ eue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number is the input 0 ) .
kt@@ ast@@ m@@ gr immediately left , when it started . I didn &apos;t support Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get no refund .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is down and &amp; kt@@ ts ; it &apos;s finished . probably , you must not be solved by G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x . if the problem is not solved , you may not have a compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update G@@ Stre@@ amer .
it doesn &apos;t work with any other application , when I &apos;m working simultaneously with any other application . if I get a text@@ book , fri@@ gh@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message on the console ; appears a message that says : don to open PC@@ M .
on your system , the problem is that conflicts in AL@@ SA will occur at AL@@ SA . evidence for potential solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projected ect@@ .org .
I &apos;ve got an extra voice for festival out of the internet . I have installed them and can use them in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ man shows this voice .
add in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / s the new voice . as a guide , you can also serve the other entries . if that &apos;s successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; where you have found the voice to the developers .
on the card of audio map there is an setting speed . this allows you to install the SO@@ X program and set the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thesizer feature such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed at the card device . depending on the chosen voice is active or active .
the settings for the speakers will be ignored , when it reads ( note that HTML is controlled by SS@@ ML ) . ( see ) or if you are completely different , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ form@@ er@@ filter , and put the speed up .
I didn &apos;t know that websites with a female voice will be read . I have a female festival speaker , but it also reads the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not work to work . thus , the X@@ SL file carries a change from SS@@ ML to S@@ but the GEN@@ DER Tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a specific character set filter , and now I can go back in &amp; kt@@ i ; not more sat@@ elite - or return . on the box &apos;s orders , the task is displayed only from a set . what do I am wrong ?

before you go , check out if your voice syn@@ thesizer correctly works correctly . follow the instructions that you receive the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best @-@ free T@@ TS @-@ syn@@ thesizer . the quality of the votes is generally well , and there are several voices and languages . in many voices , you can adjust the volume , speed , and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ons .
you need to install at least one language . help to read the pipes , which will be supplied with the festival . want to read web pages , you will need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile a additional module , so you need the source code of Festival . the German votes are subject to any restrictions regarding the creation .
this voice is Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . if you need to set the Russian voices , you &apos;ll need to enter the Russian voices to ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a cy@@ ri@@ ll@@ ische ( 8 @-@ bit ) co@@ coding such as k@@ oi@@ 8 @-@ R .
this is normally included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions are usually included . if you are looking for the first CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 option .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic as for example k@@ oi@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ syn@@ thesizer . then , Festival will generate the Det@@ er@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , which will produce the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA version , and the MB@@ RO@@ LA version can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; our language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create these di@@ phone . festival generates this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA . you can also generate Di@@ ph@@ on _ tx@@ n . for more information you can find from German text di@@ phone .
in this procedure , additional wra@@ pper will be added to festival synchron@@ isation . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA version will not be installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA file , but also in the folder festival / li@@ b / folders .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows the administration to network interfaces , the routine and the DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows users to manage a range of system and des@@ kt@@ op@@ settings via a single , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf file system was developed to provide users the administration of TCP / IP network settings in the same way , such as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create for the users a simple interface for the following tasks :
after installing a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched through a selection of k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet and network networking settings in &amp; k@@ screen .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware doesn &apos;t install them . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ ings ; the device shows all the device and setting the network characteristics .
most cases will be added for the network hardware and other devices with the installer / Linux ; installed and equipped . network appliances will later added , the drivers will need to be loaded by adap@@ ting to the following files , according to the core version :
the module settings is loaded , if the option is selected using network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index index is selected . when using the module &apos;s network settings , this platform is trying to detect the platform on the system .
if the platform is not recognized , the platform is offered . it is the platform to select the distribution and re@@ ease . because of the setting up non @-@ once again , the platform can be set permanently . while the next start of network settings will then be set automatically , this selection will be set automatically .
the change of network settings are available only in system management mode . before , all options are gray , meaning that settings can only be viewed . in the system management mode , you will click on the right lower end of the module mode . it &apos;s the input of the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the Reiter Network interfaces serves to manage the network appliances of the system . all available network appliances are displayed . from the riders network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the settings can be realized through a selection of the desired device in the list and click the button of the button , set up in the dialog .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . ank@@ le the Kn@@ op@@ es Advanced settings shows the dialogue with further options .
the TCP / IP settings are specified for the system at the same time with the start of system services . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP servers will be required for any system start . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , can be selected according to the system .
the TCP / IP configuration can be performed on the TCP / IP configuration . in the input box IP address the desired TCP / IP address should be specified . in the input box network mask is the sub@@ net mask .
if this setting is selected , the system is initi@@ alized the network interface on boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values contained in this dialogue are displayed as the characteristics of the device in the device .
it should be sure that the IP address in the network will not be used for a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the console , you can find whether the desired address is already used in use . in doubt the network should be asked to the network administrator .
network appliances can be activated , depending on demand , or switched off . ready @-@ to @-@ out network device is carried out by a selection of the list and click on interface .
network appliances can be activated , depending on demand , or switched off . a activ@@ ating network device takes place through a selection of the list and click on interface .
the IP address delivered in the local sub@@ net that conve@@ ys the physical link to the network networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ cut@@ ters .
if the computer is present more than a network interface , the interface must be connected to the net , in which the Gateway computer is selected .
a computer with DNS support will be replaced as a computer address . this is necessary because computer can only understand IP address . if the computer has htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS sol@@ ves this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the machine is added to the name resolution board offers a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , or changed to .@@ DNS entries can be arranged through a selection of an agreement and execution or her@@ pes in the list with the kno@@ bs up or down in the priority .
by pressing the button hin@@ ts ... out of the group calcul@@ ator on the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will add the dialogue New Nam@@ da@@ ver .
first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then add the button . this entry will then be added in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator , select an entry and then click on the button .... It is displayed the dialog .
the list of @-@ known computers are known as computer @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it will be used primarily to boot when any DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks it can replace the DNA server .
usually , the list contains in @-@ known calcul@@ ator some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ ho@@ st@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses . this is still in the review of the IP set up in the future .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known machine &apos;s IP address and then click on adding .... The Di@@ alogue of New Company will add .
add the name of the well @-@ known machine type and the button of hin@@ ts . if the famous computer has several also known as name , de kno@@ ck add several times and enter the other as named name .
select an entry of one @-@ known tool from the list and select , editing , and select the dialog ?
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then click on OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings are not effective immediately in the system . to enable the changes , the following command must be sold in a &amp; con@@ sole ; the following command can be sold .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ ing@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , you can download the latest version of the source material .
for installation of bin@@ ders distribution ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient when &amp; K@@ DE and Q@@ t is installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced user . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; con@@ sole ; with rpm like this follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphic surface such as cold or the installation tool of your distribution can be used .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE is sufficient , but in addition , development planning with libraries and others needed .
this is only experienced users for users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile it . the following commands should make this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on fundamental network technology , in the second section are acqu@@ itted all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change configuration files .
this area can not replace further knowledge via IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration into a small ( home ) network is conve@@ yed .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 4 has never been found . of IPv6 , it is expected to keep in the near future . this description focuses on the spread of IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to assi@@ gn IP address to network interface . in foreign networking sites , the network is the contact location which can be valid for a valid IP address or if available , DH@@ CP can &apos;t be used any case any case , the IP address can not be easily elected !
when creating a own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from one especially for this purpose , to avoid IP address with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not re@@ directed at the Internet , so its use is possible .
of course , the access can be enabled to the Internet for such machines by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , addresses are used in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is used for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things are 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route that requires the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the standard route will be required for the IP transmission .
the power address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . normally the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; they are affected and where they are in the different districts .
this file is dynami@@ cally changed for DSL connections , so it &apos;s not surprised if in the case of active DSL connections to find another content as specified in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another stand can be expected as expected .

&amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application that can run other programs after a schedule in the background . it is a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX ; system program cr@@ on .
at the start of &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; see a list of variable tasks and environmental protection variable . if you are using &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; it can be used as root for all users of the system as well as system @-@ in @-@ file tasks . each folder can be put and added .
in a de@@ activated task , programm@@ name and parameter is not displayed and activ@@ ates under description .
here , the environment variable set the existing environment variable for all @-@ up tasks except force . with a de@@ activated variable appears as description de@@ activated .
to create a new task , first you choose to edit the files folder . then , in the menu , New ... Altern@@ ativ can also read with the right mouse button on the tasks files and in the context menu menu New ... select or C@@ tr@@ l ; N press .
enter here the name of the start program . you can specify either a relative or an absolute path names . if you want to search in the program you want to choose out ...
choose the minute ( n ) , to which the task is to be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you may have the minutes in fifth steps .
if you choose both Mon@@ thly Day ( e ) and week@@ day ( e ) , the task will select both in a matching day of day . if you choose from the 1st and 15th and Sunday , the program will run independently from the week@@ day , and also on every Sunday of the months , regardless of which they fall .
as in creating new tasks , changes are still active when the c@@ ron@@ tab was stored .
to cut a job , they first select the task of an inter@@ mission . go to edit and cut out .
alternatively , you can select with the right mouse button to the task and select C@@ tr@@ l ; X .
to copy a task , they choose to copy it to the copied task . then go to edit copying .
alternatively , you can select with the right mouse button to the task and select Cop@@ y C@@ tr@@ l ; C .
to add a task , first one must be cut out into the cli@@ p@@ board or copied it at all . then , they add a file @-@ file at all . then , they will add to edit mode .
alternatively , you can select with the right mouse button on the tasks -@@ folder and select C@@ tr@@ l ; V .
to take changes to a job , first , choose one at first . go to the menu point , edit ...
alternatively , you can download with the right mouse button to the task and modify it ... select , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; it appears to be able to do this dialog , in which you can see the chosen task .
to er@@ ase a task , select the task of the task . go to the menu item you like .
in order to activate a job or dis@@ able , select them to , and determine the state with the menu point editing activ@@ ating . un@@ active tasks are characterised in their description with in@@ active .
alternatively , you can also select the right mouse button to the task and select activation . make sure that programm@@ name , parameter and description will be displayed correctly .
in order to run a task , select this and start you to edit mode .
to create a new environment variable , you choose from the variables folder . go to the menu item , New ...
alternatively , you can download with the right mouse button on the variables folder and New ... select or press C@@ tr@@ l ; N .
give you the name of the variables . you can also choose one of the list of the most frequently used environment variable ; click on the arrow from the field for the Vari@@ us name . these are :
to send e @-@ mails from the rest @-@ up program to another as the normal address
as with the creation of new variables will be made only when the c@@ ron@@ tab was stored .
to cut down a variable , they first select the variable variable . go to editing .
in order to copy a environment variable , you choose to copy the copied variable . go then to edit copying .
alternatively , you can select with the right mouse button to click the variable , copy or copy C@@ tr@@ l ; C .
in order to add a environment variable , first one must be cut out into the cli@@ p@@ board or copied it . then , the option is only available . select the variables folder . go to edit mode .
to change the variable variable , you &apos;ll choose to edit the variable variable , you can download and modify the variable button on the variable , but then press C@@ tr@@ l ; O . it appears to be the dialog variables as described above , the variable can be described above .

if all tasks and environment variable have been changed or changed , you have to store the c@@ ron@@ tab . select the menu item file .
alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S . changes or ad@@ ditions to tasks or variables will be active .
it appears to be the standard K@@ DE standard . if you choose to check out , you can see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options on the printer dialog .
prints the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible for users to have extended advanced permission .
C@@ ron , for example four x@@ ie cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the time plans of users .
a PO@@ SIX compliant &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; it has the possibility to create several archives on a band . moreover , the first thing was to create a surface for tar to create a question . the second goal was to question a question that my wife introduced to my wife : how much longer takes it , if you are driving ?
before a band can be used , it must be operated by &amp; k@@ dat ; that can happen in three types :
&amp; k@@ dat ; sp@@ ult the band , and reads the special information of the Ban@@ des . recogn@@ ises &amp; k@@ dat ; the act on the tape will not be asked if the band will be format .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ sp@@ ear , looking for the matching index on your plate . may not be found , you will be asked if the band index will be re@@ created .
if everything went out , the symbol changes the tape drive to indicate that the band is integrated . in the status of the status , the volume of the band can now be looking for the volume sign for the band .
before the out of the ban@@ ana , first , all the integration must be solved . there are three methods to apply this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; a change of symbols for the band has been solved that the band has been solved for the band and shows a corresponding news release . the band can now be disc@@ arded without any danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; format .
a band must be form@@ att@@ ed before you can &apos;t use the format . this process does not happen before you use the band of &amp; k@@ dat ; if you want to use the band of &amp; k@@ dat ; usually , flo@@ ppy drives are usually using a form@@ att@@ ing of the band , the DA@@ T drives cannot be used .
after entering the band , and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format of the band . all data on the band is lost ! after completion of the form@@ att@@ ing process , the band will automatically be integrated and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup procedure , you must select the saf@@ est files , which can happen to three types :
select a file or a file in the local file tree . it is backed only this file or file @-@ file .
mark a profile profile in the tree . it is backed by the profile specified in the profile .
mark your files in the local file tree with a h@@ ooks . only the so striking files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu of Shech@@ em ...
once the backup was launched , the dialog elements for backup . in this dialogue , you can check the selected files and modify the settings for backup .
if you confirm the settings , the dialog , the dialogue shows the progress of the securing data , including the data rate and the remaining time .
mark a file or file in one of the archives in the file for the drive . it only uses the selected file or file files .
mark the files in one of the archives in the archives for the band with a h@@ ooks . it will only tested the selected files and / or sub@@ folders .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry for testing ....
once the test procedure started , the dialogue applies for review . in this dialogue you can check even your selection and support for the review .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialogue appears to review . this dialogue shows the progress of the exam and the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can connect the files , the files must be restored , marked by two types :
select a file or a file in one of the archives created for the tape drives . it is restored only the selected file or the sub@@ ordination .
mark the desired files from one of the archives with a h@@ ooks . it will only be restored with the so selected files and / or sub@@ folders .
click with the right mouse button to a file or a file in a archives and select in the menu . ...
once the restoration process started , the dialog for recovery . in this dialogue you can check even your selection and recovery to recovery .
if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog , the dialogue shows the progress of the recovery and the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to create the band index@@ ed . on this process , all existing index files for this band . you can create the index to two types of the band :
as a result , a profile profile with the just marked files and the default settings . you can use the following settings :
the current work , in which securing the backup should be done . the list of the saf@@ est files are automatically updated according to the appropriate work file .
for all folders , which are listed under the backup files that are stored on the same file system , such as the file . folders such as a file that can be found on other fil@@ esystem . each entry is taken from tar independently from the other .
perform an in@@ mental backup of backup . to determine which files have been changed since the last in@@ mental backup , a sn@@ ap file is used . it only secured the files that have been changed since .
the name of the file , which is used to ensure changes since the last in@@ mental retard@@ ant has been used .
calculated the sn@@ ap@@ shots file before the call of tar . this causes that all files are backed up and a new sn@@ ap@@ shots file for the next backup is laid out .
the functionality of the buttons &amp; gt ; gt ; and lt ; then , files was not fully implemented entirely at the time of the preparation of this documentation .
the settings can be installed via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu settings , the following settings can be :
the complete path to the device file system for the tape drives ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ ty version of the tape drive .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is involved , the command load will be connected to the drive . some running units is this necessary , before read or write operations .
if the option is switched on , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; the yield of the tape drives . possibly , this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , when using the integration of &amp; k@@ dat , the band is done automatically . use this option in Flo@@ ppy @-@ Stre@@ am@@ ern .
if the option is switched on , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware blocking size is required for the tape drive . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must be able to use &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block@@ size is to be able for your band@@ age .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band format , it writes a file at the beginning of the band . this file should only be given a memory block on the band . the contents of the file is as follows :
( n byte ) The band @-@ ID . this drawing is the complete name of the system , where the band was form@@ att@@ ed . seconds , the number of seconds , which have been passed since the era have passed , in which the band was format .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar -@@ archives that can admini@@ ster directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar manage . even other tar @-@ versions should work as long as it is not in@@ mental sc@@ ents .
check the content of a safety binding . this symbol is only active when a band is included .
&amp; k@@ system log , you can &apos;t know where you can &apos;t know information about your system , or where the system can be stored on your system , or where the system allows users to access the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system log has experienced users quick access for example on information about problems that will occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users to understand your computers in the background . it &apos;s a simpli@@ fied presentation of the protocol files in your own system . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users , don &apos;t know where you can get information about your system , or where the system is stored on different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system log has experienced users for quick access to the example of information about problems that will be appearing on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , some extended functions can be fil@@ tered by using the protocol files ( fil@@ tered ) files .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a range of useful functions . among other things , among others :
support for many different types of protocol files , for the format of the sy@@ slog server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included in the other chapters of this hand .
like you see in the following screen photo shows , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available , with its help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file is easily filters and sorted . the individual possibilities for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this hand .
after the start , it tries to open and open this system protocol , and it will not be open to system log messages . the protocol files are usually found in the file / var / log file , for the normal users usually do not have a permission to read .
you can also use the filter system to fil@@ tered according to the chosen filters . in the standard setting , you can only find a protocol which is displayed in the standard filter . then , a protocol line will only appear if in one of the columns the character set off the filter system .
of course , you can choose one another entry in this point . select the column of the filter process , and you will also select the fil@@ en@@ code of a process that shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all the protocol lines are sent to which this process was broadcast or created .
this option is activated in the standard setting , and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level bug are displayed with a eye @-@ catching color as a protocol lines . the colored illustration of protocol lines can be out@@ dated .
if you want to use only certain process ( for example in system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , so you can be useful if you want to investigate the issue of a certain command , such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you can use filter options .
in addition , you can jump the option to view new lines jump in the context menu of the main event , to allow all new added protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in a separate windows . to open this function , use the entries in the window to open up additional sub@@ window and manage to manage . once you have selected a window , select a protocol for viewing .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has a own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you can find more current information about the reference sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you also find in the following file of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Subversion Archi@@ vs : c@@ system log ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ archive
welcome to &amp; K@@ DE , System V of the Editor , rather known ( and in the following also called ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section goes into a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V ap@@ t system develops fast to the standard for control of the program starts at the high @-@ speed system in the &amp; Linux ; so it is why it easier to use more powerful , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD columns .
I will not go further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know anything else : - ) .
the lo@@ af binary file is therefore important because maybe someone could try to take a machine on the V of the wheel , without a new installation and new form@@ att@@ ing file . that &apos;s why you need to be sure that the old ap@@ t is removed from there , if there was there .
the SY@@ SV line@@ ages also differs from the BSD , that the configuration files in a sub@@ folders of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this file is r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; s@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ pd &amp; etc ; system services do not include such stuff like set@@ backs that will only start once again . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you &apos;re not able to use this file , even if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ js in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something to do with the serial connection .
kernel is looking for various places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one that he finds .
the standard run @-@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see in the starting area as the following :
at this point you can look at a look into the second column and you can change it / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab of hand and change the 3 change . if you are looking forward a bit , then you will repair your system by setting the system new and restart the following :
but how do you start all the right scrip@@ tions ? if you enter into r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this file . instead , each entry is here on one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how starts and stops in@@ it actually System services ? quite simple : each of the scrip@@ ting is that it accepts a argument like boot and stop . you can actually start this script by hand on the command line in the following manner :
this would be the htt@@ pd server . it reads the name , and if that is an K , the script will be called by the argument . when it includes an S , the script will be called by the argument .
some people want to install a simple way to use machines for many purposes . I could run it on htt@@ pd , &amp; s@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; running up . furthermore , I could even have a user @-@ service level , which will start &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be difficult to be difficult because the program is so user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another time mobile device is simple to say to say tri@@ vial : pull out an entry of your sharing system services to one of the six run level to start him on this level ( or stop stop ) .
you can also modify the script also between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within one levels by changing them . this is done by its original run @-@ level ( or its position ) . this happens not only if they pull out an entry of your initial system services .
note : entries are shi@@ fted to copy it into a new area . to copy it only to a new service level , you must choose any copy of the menu or from the context menu and in the target range -- even if the same entry was already in the target range of action .
the Sor@@ ti@@ r number of a entry can sometimes be calculated . in such a case you must edit the sorting parts of the surrounding entries before you can try to include the system service .
note : at present , there is no possibility to restore entries that were cast into the paper basket . let &apos;s be careful .
you can use the table @-@ button to enable the different areas of work ( sharing system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to meet a selection .
to postp@@ one entry into another run @-@ level , take him into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired Run@@ level with inser@@ ts ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sor@@ row , or modify the name of a entry manually , press the input button to change between different fields . do not use the dialogue through er@@ ect of the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to get the changes to the changes .
due to the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file is a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . if they are stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . otherwise they will be restored from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . they are stored in a local sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I used the standard Run@@ level@@ n with the standard run@@ n , and now starts the machine @-@ resistant . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard run @-@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be usually in order ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under the run @-@ level X , but they will not be executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) you will need to be able to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read details in the manual of the distribution .
the species , such as system services are started in these distri@@ butions , is simpli@@ fied the configuration of proprietary entries in this district , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using any other distribution , please check whether all the configuration files are available , and if they are in the right directory . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ pd ) just stop without news , if their configuration files are not present or wrong .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be used from version to version different . if you use another distribution , please send us information about the running level , so that this manual may be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment of &amp; k@@ user ;
after you have made changes , you have to store this . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool bar or entry to the menu in the menu .
&amp; k@@ user is a simple application . the main window is made up of two cart@@ ons , user &apos;s user interface list . you can select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears to be the dialog and group properties .
some card cards are shown only if you have extended system settings . only if you can install any system settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for user interface . additional maps will appear , if Shadow -@@ passwords or e.g. / etc / Master .@@ pass@@ w@@ d can be installed in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the card card &apos;s card appears , if Shadow -@@ passwords , e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD - Uni@@ xes are installed .
this card card will only be activated if required for at least one @-@ page file system limits ( Qu@@ ota ) . the file system can be changed on the file system . here you can change each user on each user , with the limits on data in KB are :
these parameters can be set for each file system individually . the current file system is chosen with the help of the file system with space limitation .
the card groups informs about the group of the selected we@@ arer . the standard group , which is part of the user , you will find in the field primary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member of other groups , by setting this in large field .
the dialog features include a list of all users . to add a user to add a user to add this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , you add to add a group or a group or click on the matching execution of the tool bar . edit or use of the selected users or the selected group .
with this module , you can add the L@@ ILO @-@ Boot@@ Manager , which can change it and change times up to the boats of the standard operating system , remove the default operating system , remove systems , change systems and change more .
