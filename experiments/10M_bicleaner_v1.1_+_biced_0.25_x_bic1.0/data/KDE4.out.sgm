<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, working procedures, constant strain of images at different themes and a large number of all. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files and you will not want to organize your structure for these content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What kinds of files fit together? the separation of data types makes the pile processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and unemployment files is simplified a backup strategy and migration. you'll always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option metadata to the metadata objects into the files. if you don't forget that Exif- and IPTC data will be written into the file. if you don't forget to save the metadata out of the database into the files that select the same point in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens when you want to change? to say & digitization; them have a metadata Editor for a number of selected attribute. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, since you should choose any photo postcards, labelling and an assessment. of course, you can choose the same attribute, and then set the value. you start the best with an evaluation or the leaderboard. this makes sense as you can concentrate on the top photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us go with keywords, keywords, how to continue with other programs frequently, or categories. all three are synonymous for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you have cattizing images from another source with embedded samples, then it becomes no problem for you to build up to another source. the change of Hierarchy in the building is no problem, and can easily be done by the digims to another. the modified sample may be done by & digious; it is updated during the lower trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata. this is a very large representation of representation, since each block is composed of metadata in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are all qualities of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labelling or comments, the third important tool to catastrophize your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to let most anyone who simply let your photos you want to share your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to get interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the Ferne is not even a beautiful beach-panorama. if you're looking closer, you start to see some details, people who do space.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this one of the landing site of Allies & quot; Omaha beach quot; in the French town of Normandy, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence. so, you may even hear your perception of this panorama window.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others, the title may be more important than the picture itself to create a interest. if you have images, the key is to transfer it to the viewer, which is to help me about the motive, which you moves to understand what you understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It's in order if a picture is not perfect, if the strength has only works with a labelling for themselves alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digitization; you can download it a lot of text in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8). if you are export to your wishes for your wishes to the labelling and / or the title of Web-Galeriesystems. they have to tell the story so for the opening, not a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the days before GPS? when you had to find into another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet before Google Earth? well, because with pictures the train the train takes place now with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">These possibilities are conspicuous. I am sure that one day, in the near future you can continue using Google Earth. then, the pictures can also be export with Google Earth. they can also be export to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the Google Maps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and describes the practice the copyright rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedom are also valid in all geared versions, so also for the work of other.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description says you information in the main site of & delivery; as information is stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for writer and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the photographers, then it can't be used. after this value, it should not be changed. after this value, he should not be changed. this field does not support Semikolons as a partition.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author's author (synonym for the Constitutional Treaty): associated with the author. examples include: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independence of commercial photographer. since this is a memorandum to authorization, must be filled with this as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for vendors): use the author's provider to identify the picture. if the photographer must be listed here as Reuters or Associated Press, then you can offer this picture. if the picture is a repository picture, then the group / agency is provided here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although these do not need any protection against misuse. this is a digital watermark. for private individuals, this is the majority of your photos only from low interest. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important for professionals.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in picture. & digikam; in the near future, there will be such a module for the stacking processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: turnout, turnout, electricity, ECC, transmission error, aging of storage media, restoration, Redundanz, disinformation, life time, temperature, data size, widespread aberrations</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs on the street or a fire. these kind of losses are the same as you can also pass at the traditional paper photos or negative. in this section it goes to problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data reprogramming company in the world, has some interesting statistics showing the reasons for a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, you can buy even longer than a few years of mind. there are also offers more than gold coated DVDs, & Dollar; 2 pieces will make a life time of 100 years for themselves. whether you believe that this is in your measurmeasuration.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be able to read this risk in which you can use good discs and good recording devices. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you can write a lot of reliable. therefore, this is the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even though you have just written a control mechanism. despite this massive protection, it is required for formations and control systems. despite this massive protection it is required by chemical supplies, Ultraviolet light, cratzer, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a cheap program called IsoBuster that doesn't work with CDs and DVDs. there are also similar applications the damaged data of damaged disks, hard drives, Flashmedia, USB drive works, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to save up to HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB for the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all for CDs and DVDs, it is also applies to the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">If you're looking for a high-quality media in a non-quality media. if you decide to check the media with a description, date and author password. don't forget to copy the data on the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves. their manufacturers guarantee a new disk, but not the data. Google represents a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks: discusers</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: Disks keep the most common error of the error of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. at a lower temperature range, SMART can't find this mistake. some of the SMART error occurs in particular Lesefehler and publishing counter. the unexpected life time is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss of loss due to overvoltage. of course, you may have data loss because if you have secured the files, but these losses can be copied without great problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices are not enough, it can take heavy damage to devices with computer chips and high speed process, these anomalies damage, destroyed motherboards and other defective. if you use even before the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against electricity points is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that is part of the energy consumption and is usually available in the form of a plug-bar. do not remember that any plug-in is also available in the form of power.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a specific minimum of protection. you should also be careful to protect the protection against lightning strikes.</seg>
<seg id="192">As a power supply can be connected to your computer system, you should make sure that all peripherals can also be connected to your modem. some manufacturers make a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of cable modems and the TV map.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable-voltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks, and therefore also include the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for you.</seg>
<seg id="194">During an overvoltage protection your system in front of smaller fluctuations are not really help in a complete failure. even a few seconds can lead to the loss of unbeatable data. therefore, it can be useful to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection, these devices can automatically get up to electricity. some models allow them to go back up to electricity. if you are able to buy the same quality requirements as a low-voltage protection. furthermore, the battery life of the battery and the surrounding software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concerns the potential risk that your computer system is to prevent up to & euro; 20 cost, A 500W USV you can think about it as well as your calculator. finally, you should think about all the cable to trenne before you drive into the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use this as drive under Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software. Google Shared Storage is a further popular offering to data from any amounts of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, they are very expensive in comparison to the hard drives at home - 40 GB per dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & Dollar; 500. furthermore, you must send the data on comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">These solutions are therefore suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures. this is not a bad solution, but it's not a general safety solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com will provide you more efficiently on photos stored in the case of Flickr. for $25 a year, you will get unlimited memory that will be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">Data from the data backup are very safe. transfer rates are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol automatically adjusted and with the big companies the offer of backup and a partially covered memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transmission system are susceptible to transmission error. the filesystem will be at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst failure is that no one thing happened in your hardware. it is rather untroubled that it should not be put in your computer. no one doesn't seem to have any protection in your computer. no one seems that the Internet with its TCP uses is a much more secure data away than that of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Reliable power supplies are another source for transfers, since they generate Interepreferences within the data stream. with normal file systems remain unnoticed this error is unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not particularly affected by Transfer payments, you should look into the future. in 2010 you'll see thousands of bugs a year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS's Sun Microsystems appears to be one of two candidates. it's open-source, with many patents and is available under one of the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in the alpha-status. it is the same protection mechanisms used and is also available for & Linux; but it's not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Underestimate these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in notebook and 46% for working systems. notebooks, in notebooks, the proportion of steels will be 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the most of viruses. it is not limited to Microsoft systems, such as theft and new installations. and it is currently not only a few viruses and under Linux; it has been sighted on a few viruses.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: false, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS file. a very good English items will find here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: false, only the speed of the investigators process during a surgery is higher and a defined status is avoided. however, if a file is not completely saved before the problem is lost, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat for digital data: false, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors selected by digital cameras are 1-2 aperting settings of fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while technology is further developed there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and noise-characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go down in the direction of 10 megapixels. even if this dissolution is good for a compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixel cameras. for higher resolutions, you require a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive is currently being responsible for 100 & euro. therefore, you might be able to secure your data from any loss of data loss. so, you'll want to secure your data often as the re-installation of your operating system, the exchange of panels or the size change of hard disks.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you are supposed to make your sickness on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash is shortened, if the drive was not associated with the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster took place locally and destroyed a lot. don't forget aircraft accidents: fire, water, electricity, children and steels are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect an entire room or the whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, Desastervorbeuf always does not have local storage. bring your sickness to the steps, into the neighbouring house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is an additional advantage of the physical separation: as above already said, is a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup is not available immediately, then you can save the one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files are backed up. it is a momentum with history without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential: a backup of files which have been changed since the last complete operation. creates a complete snapshot-up to two periods: the complete backup and the last differential locking.</seg>
<seg id="222">A variety of files that have been changed since the last backup has been changed. you can use the original status at any time again. these backup will be back to such a versioning system at the next with the exception that it is only sampled and not progressing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily install your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP, or other types of file association scripts only the difference of files really changed. this happens, and if you want to increase the safety over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure significant pictures directly after you have stored on your computer a DVD or another optic medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">In the end, you can get enough time to explore losses and again. at the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly resumption for at least one month and a momentum for each month. each other outage should be done manually, after which you have a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, showing XMP files, original file, automates XMP files, original file, memory, scalability, media, relocate images and metadata, copy images on the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., to use the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">Thus valuable images the next 40 year survival, that is about the time period in you really interested in your childhood and youth, there are two strategies that should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future because of your nature unforeseeable: all 5-8 years should be considered. unfortunately, there are no other possibility to stand out like the current system. if less variants they were used in the past, the easier is the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered using the explanations in this document. use or change the open standards which are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is nowadays available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important to reading your images, then store it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and scertechnology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay in open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist printing for the possibility to change a system in size. this means actually enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go out that you want the scalability using a dedicated plate or partition. if you want to have a dedicated plate or partition used. in * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and put on a new record.</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the command dmesg whether your new plate is detected, but depend on it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& / dev / sdb; parted / dev / sdb; parted in MB3 / dev / sdb; size of the record in MB2,3; # does not work with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & Dollar; resize2fs / dev / corc1 # .dll to the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day does not read the software there, then you can create these themselves. this task is easier by year to a year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format which is slow by the market. you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard, XMP, exinf and IPTC Metadates, 16-bit per colour channel and full transparency. PNG can not be used for improved color information, but not as many as TIFF. this format would like to recommend you to store your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widespread than image format. TIFF can be saved in uncompressed shape or in a container with a lossless compression (default). however, a problem is that this format has been adapted to many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a free and open touch formats. DNG is now being developed on the TIFF / EP by the help of the help of metadata. DNG is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is probably one of the reasons why to replace the & quot; image resource quot;, a mix of XML and RDF. it is a file information that allows users to integrate it into one file itself. the file information are stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers make it a picture of your recording, mostly in raw file format. it can be used to problems with the link between metadata and image file and how above already mentioned the raw format. therefore, you should use DNG as a container and put it all there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization that supports working on a architecture and modeling, discussions and community work in DCMI groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and awareness efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanners. so long the pictures on the camera's camera can be used as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert Rohfiles to DNG and store this in your RohArchives. this function is not implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a sensitive editing, you can use external programs. if you were able to add the images again with & digious; then, you should add the metadata to the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Use the revised images for copyright law with a digital watermark. export them only in WebGaleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera-interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digious; in the section he add photos you can already add on your hard drive. the camera-interface provides you a lot of advanced settings for importing from images to your Albatatee.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digious; to use your digital camera, connect the camera to display mode, switch the camera on display mode, and turn it into a further description of your camera, please refer to the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, this is a while using your camera. some cameras are displayed at the lower end and if this is the case, the file name is displayed and a symbol for file association for each file, photos, films, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you need to download the photos on your computer, you may need to see the camera information to any entry. with the sidebars features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an agreement or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialogue shows file characteristics and the photo information that internally are stored by the camera. an icon shows that the image was not downloaded on your computer. please note that at some digital cameras don't have any information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider metadata displays the internal metal rates such as Exif, Manufacture, GPS etc. this information is the same as the metadata objects from the main window of the digitization; or the image processing. note that these metadata are not available at some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer download and then download the photos of your camera into one single album in & digitization; for downloading the photos are not deleted, and we recommend you check images sure the pictures will be sure to delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you want to download all photos you want to download the required standard methods of & KDE, you can download the knobs and then run the button. download the button for download, until you have chosen some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, you can't download it. these images have not been downloaded from & digious; in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in advance. if you choose this option, the new pictures will be downloaded from the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you can download the buttons for download or so far, a dialogue with which you can select the photos stored in which the photos are sorted. details on the files you can read in the section of My albums. then select the target album from the list and press you OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have chosen the target album, press the OK, and & digious; invites the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them by the camera. if you want to erase all the button. if you want to delete the button. if you want to erase only a few erase you need to connect this first and subsequently be chosen.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there will not be able to restore images from the camera. you should have been carefully check if the photos should be able to delete them from the camera. if you want to erase your camera, you should make sure that you want to do the camera system because this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as a file name for the photos are often used in the photos taken after the photos taken from the camera. so, if you can load photos of different recording studios in the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time, in which the picture was taken to integrate into the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for threshing and spy. if you use this final option, you will automatically create a file per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options of the transmission opens three other options which will be stored on the record. if you select this, the respective entries will be copied to the IPTC field. with the last option, you can correct date and time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use a different file format as the default format, you can use the prefix photo-% Y-% -%% H% H:% S:% S. switch to the option 'date and time. for more customizations you should read the help of the last time.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera-file name, you have the possibility to change the file name in small letters. or in large letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digious; for a photo is displayed below the name, the camera is displayed in the preview. your settings are stored and automatically used if you open the camera's next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitization; can do all information about the orientation of the camera to be able to perform automatic rotation throughout the way. not all cameras provide information on this information. in the section of page bar metadata, you can read more details about the camera that embedded in the photograph.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and when your camera does not supplies this information, the photo in the original orientation. if you want the automatic spin, use the button and select the automatic rotation in the lower area of the Fensters.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera information about the date, at which the picture is made available, can be loaded to the image records. these are all cameras with the same date you can download this information. in the section of the meta-data you can read that information on the camera was embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case you want to change the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, please use the button, and select the option to set up the set-based lower attachment at the lower end of the Fensters.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from their computer to upload, is the button. select the files stored on your camera. you can select the files stored on your camera. you can also select more than one file with the standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After image selection is done, ask & digitization; you, where the pictures should be uploaded. a folder dialog for the camera appears. select the desired file and press you OK to restart the pictures. photos will not delete the pictures from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a universal term in this document. this is a position which can be displayed in length and latitude, and the data may be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photography, it can be interesting to cessful a picture with a precise use of GPS data. environmental planer, military, police, architecture office and real estate agency may be able to use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you don't forget to open a browser if you want to open a browser to another & digious; users can send a postcard on the site of the photos, or simply can only document these aspect, it's good to enter the positional data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is to come, how the GPS data will come into this field? first, you should have at least three ways to reach this field. directly with the right hardware, more than a reediting of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for the geographical association (manual) and most recently about the input of well-known locations.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is no camera that integrates a GPS unit. but there is a couple who work with GPS receiver. either as a card module or by using the data via a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: coyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or GPSBabel. you must save these data but in GPX format, because this is the only format that is supported by the module for the geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract the data from images and correlate, and correlate, on the following page, you can make the same under & Linux: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the lengths of longitude and break, or other data, then you can use this script which works with the Exiftool by Phil Harvey. it uses the prevention of balance that are prepared for example from Ens.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Encyclopedia states there are no European street types. here are some European pages, at least on French, German and Spanish, which all navigation details for Europe show.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digitization; to give you much control over his working course, you'll need to change the behaviour of the digitization; you'll need to change the settings of the digitization; set up in eight pages. you can choose between these change by using the symbols of the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">This can select a editing preview or image processing. they put the standard behavior of & digitization; fixed, if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>

<seg id="287">Publishers is a synonym for provider: use this box for example, if this is not the author, as well as Reuters or Associated Press, these organizations have to be registered here. if the picture is a repository picture, then the group should be available, then it should be available here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC-actions store the data in the respective IPTC field. this means that the metadata are not only available in the database of & digious; these metadata are also available in other programs and can be imported into & delivery without lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Images depicts the comments as an embedded troducts (JFIF), which allows you to read your photos from the images of embedded images. attention: at images which already contain labelling, they are written by the delivery of the digitisation.</seg>

<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset back, by implementing the button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the illuminated & digious settings can be switched on this page. some pictures have different sizes and synchronous mode. if you don't have to use the option & quot; if you have a better machine, you can only receive a better performance results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select this here. you can use the tool bar, if you use image editing in full-mode mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Full and submarine areas can be marked with dark or brighter colour in the picture. these colours will be set here. in image editing, this application mode can be switched on F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma Subsampling, it is meant that the images in a higher resolution of the luminance is encoded into the color cards. please read this article in Wikipedia for the detailed explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG-compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. the only effect is that the image data is more time for aligning and unpack. if you have a quick computer, you can put this value to a high compression. thus, 1: low and 9 is a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF files, you can modify the default decompression of the TIFF file for TIFF's images. this reduces the size of the TIFF pictures. it has no impact on the image quality, since the default algorithm is lossfree.</seg>
<seg id="299">If you select the loss of lossless JPEG 2000 files, if you select the loss of quality loss and file size much better than in normal JPEG. when this paragraph, Metadata were not supported, but it was not yet found in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the previous versions of & digious, image processing only came to photos. at the moment, the image processing only develops into a tool for manipulation of your photos. in this dialogue, you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard gain is that all green pixels are equal. if you use this option, if you use this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option is a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 Ged pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white arrow is used in the camera. otherwise, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white equalizer is not set. standard is a fixed color balance that was photographed on a white map which was photographed on a white map.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setup is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the benefit of the second sensors has the effect that underscores images in four steps more details in the hairline. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top-lights, so the parts of your camera are burned down in the settings. the colors solve some unusual results in various rosatönen. most recently, you can try some parts of the missing information from top-catches.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general is not as fast as green and red. they are trying to reconstruct the lack of green and red pixels. of course this is a question, how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option to set any level, you get the possibility to set a level. here's a value of three is a compromise, and can therefore be adjusted for each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminance on your taste. you have to set it some higher than the standard 1. this can also be done later in the picture options of the & digious; -image processing. in order to keep the time for Demosaicing, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process that comes from a complete picture of part-filtring image sensor, which are many cameras, and a matrix of colour-pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA Interpolation or Farbreframe.</seg>
<seg id="310">The first algorithm used for me: bilingear, VNG interpolation (variable number of gradient) was used. however, VNG interpolation (variable number of graft) was used. however, it produces color vision to the edges. bilingear is interesting, if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lentils you can set the red and blue corrective values here. this is certainly the best method for a colour correction, as you will be done during the rough converted.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile has been translated into account the color information and instructions how these may be given. there are also LCMS and & digious; information such as colour space using a colour space in the other, so the colors are as precisely as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Questions, if a picture is opened in image editing, will start / colour management module with rough files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile file you can use the folders such as / usr / share / color / ICC / / home / user / .color / ICC, in which you want to save all of the profiles. & digitising; these folders then came during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC profiles here you have the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles. all you can change in opening of the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative opposite Xcalib or Argyll. here, only your images are not administrated by the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should do not fit into the same type. there are some examples such as Canon which do not contain color mapping or gammaxcorrection. at the moment, dcraw Gamma does not contain any conversions at 16-bit depth. this means you need to carry out the color mapping themselves.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft-Proof profile, with which you can print out, as your printer would like to print a smaller color range than your camera and some colours are very saturated. this could be corrected because of your printer's blind algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious that colour profile with them is designed for what it is intended. unfortunately, this is a table of cameras and profile. therefore, this is a table of cameras and profile.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension allows the style to detect: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for neutrally, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & KDE; image plugin interface. it's an interface that supports to work from a series of & KDE; many modules support which were written to work with each program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If you want to use the KIPI modules, you will see a list of the available modules. choose from that you want to use and this will be loaded by & digious; these modules appear as a new entries in the menu of the main entrance and in addition, you will find some of the menu on the menu.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short-warrants for tasks that are conducted by modules in the menu, can be set up in the menu under settings.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) via KIPI-modules, you can use the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins or in the books of the KIPI modules.</seg>

<seg id="338">Image processing contains a range of tools to improve your images. some of them stand in & delivery; these are not part of your distribution. if you are not part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules you will find in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the lower edge of the Fensters, the filename, current data number, Entrance factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the upper edge, including the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The machining functions of image processing will change your photos. however, no functions will change the original photo, before you use the memory or the knobs from the tool bar. please note that you can't recover the original photo, as soon as you have stored the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should use a copy of your image, before you change it. you can change it with memory.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have taken the picture, you can connect the original picture to the re-button, using the button, file sharing to the tool bar. then you lose every change that you have taken on the photo since the last memory.</seg>
<seg id="344">Nearly any promotion of image processing can be restored and restored. the last promotion can be restored and restored, by using editing or reproduce, by editing the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this often, you should make the keyboard shortened Ctrl; -z to re-end and Ctrl; -switch-old to re-manufacture.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you want to press the & LMB; in the tool bar a moment longer, you get a context menu. if you choose one of the menu plan, all actions will also be restored and restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">As soon as you have the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword, you can use the files in the menu file. if you do not have any modifications to the latest photo, you'll want to back up whether you want to back up.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can also go into the photo and out out in which you can use Ctrl; Mausrad or the symbols in the tool bar or use the entries in the menu menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adapt to a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the tool bar: enlarge Enforcement factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode the photo in full screen mode. if you do not want to use the tool bar. if you don't want to change this page dialog, you can change it from the & digious; the main window will be broadcast. see the section to set up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print out the current picture, you can select the files in the menu, and get the Standard & KDE and print dialog. you can adjust the settings you can print your photo before you.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print individual pictures or whole sets out of your selection. you need to select the pictures with the default methods and choose from the menu album Export assistant. if you follow the assistant, you need to make your choice just your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digitization; main window is set on the right edge, which provides important information and actions available for selected pictures. the same page is, without the navigation device parts, also available in image processing. it will be displayed when one of the five riders will be charged.</seg>
<seg id="354">Multifable clicks on the same rider lets the page bar set the side down or again in the edge disappear.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view, you can use the correct size. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields that you can use other programs to be used.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are formed according to 2000 characters and special characters are formed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling in other applications, you should note these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have comments, you will use either the knob / or change the next image, which will then be stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the application knob, there is a button on the selected file or the database. however, you can also write metadata to the files. this is always done if you have a metadata setting, which is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section rating shows a number of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and sorting line. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the page bar. in order to evaluate several pictures at the same time, select the context menu and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field on the IPTC field. coding follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword overview shows an search box to filter the keywords, the keyword and a select box with previously held in this & digitisation; -meeting.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamic in the set-contained function. you can easily fit the number of possibilities for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have a lot of keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is a further relief when entering the input of keywords in a picture series. if you have given different keywords, these will be stored for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords also can be set by marking of the appropriate checkbox in the tree. tags of a picture will be stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures in the main view is selected, and you will select a keyword in the keyword, and not on the entire selection, If you want to have a selection with a keyword, please read the section sample filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page bar code is used to change the selection of the box window. normally, the left side is used with their album, - data, keyword and viewpoint. if in addition, a or more sample filters from the right side will be displayed, only the section of these two are displayed. all of them are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also take advantage of keywords, and if the keyword is already exists, you can simply pull off the right side of the right side and put on the selection. then a dialogue you asks if you want the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example shows the main window of the pictures on a calender date. they were chosen with Strg + a and then a keyword from the right sample of which was pulled to the selection and set there. a dialogue is asked if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">These search for changes will take place in any launch of the program. you can also be switched on with the settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created, that it should be one or should be, you can easily change it with a double click on the text and control.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is found in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a character set, which is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an extension search for all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to grouped options, you only need to use the checkbox at the end of the rule, and then use the button. options can be seen as follows:</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written primarily by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I've used mostly to & digious; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you can use a colorable workflow from your camera or scanned colours. colour management can be found that the colors are printed on your monitor or scanners, and the colours will print you or in the web.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme of color management comes, we would like to say that you would like to find out any background information about color management at any point of the image processing. in addition to this tutorial, you would give you to make your own information on your own decisions you will receive the desired results.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image processing is fulfilled all six below criteria, you must not take care of color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB colour space. (further information you will find below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Their only other image editions are by e-mail or the Web, where the RGB of the de-facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and the life for all so simple, why should you use another colour space, so you should make thoughts about colorimetric ng?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the RGB is shown in comparison to the colours which we can really see below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors, which we can see, the hufu-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger colour space, you can visit Bruce Lindblooms, please click on info and then on information about the RGB Working Group.</seg>
<seg id="385">I must set my monitor with my monitor when I decided to work only in the RGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you're working in the RGB-colour space, so it's not to use your monitor. if you're working as a color space of sRGB, then you must use either your monitor on the sRGB standard kallibris, a suitable monitor profile, or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. use it before you try to try a further manual.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize them, the same, automatic gearbox and contrast, would try to make up the best of your colors. they need to experiment with these effects, to see what the best acts with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize them: this method does the leukaemia values over the entire image, so the darkest point is black and the brightest point as light as possible without its color shaded. this function is often common with an error correction for the dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Unequal: this method allows the same as flat as flat as flat as flat as possible. in this way, the same results achieved very good results in the contraction of a picture, sometimes it is only garbage. it is a very powerful, which causes either wonders in an image, or it was destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatically assemble the color of the red, green and blue channel. they determined the dark and bright border tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels on the entire Histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast, this method improves the contrast and the luminance of the RGB values of a picture due to the lowest and highest values in the highest possible area and a rejipoint of all values in between. this is only visible with balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The White Paper equates from & digious; is a semi-automated tool to perform the white balance on a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white correction factor is limited to about 8-bit per colour. if you can find the white screen equalizer in rough mode. if you are able to perform the white mode in rough mode, in 16-bit mode, your possibilities will fall better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white-recess of Pawel T. Jochym is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you will start him about the menu entry in white image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The forehead can be adapted to the size. on the left-hand side, the original picture is also adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original whitish, then it is sufficient to click on the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the Luminate of the Pixum is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the right, a Histogram is very helpful, as soon as you change one parameter. this Histogram is very helpful, but most pixels very small Luminous values have to choose whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated. the sum is called Luminous.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shade, saturation and gamma. the shade, you can improve the shadow details of your photos or stored.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above mentioned checks, you should use the color temperature-pipette. press the colour on this button and then set up anywhere in the color temperature for the color temperature of the White. this type, temperature and green values are automatically set on this type.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white wine on the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The surface indicators increase the colors, if more than one colour channel of the pixel error occurs. you'll get the combined result in the white image. this is indicated in the preview of a pure indicator, and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons stores as and store exactly this. any setting of the white equates you have to store this in a text file, and later again.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button sequences sets all the filter values back on their standard values and a neutral white-neutral cover. note that even neutral settings are another photo as your original. if you want to store your original image.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the codization depth per colour channel of the revised image. 8-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. these coding requires even more record field, data eit, and is available for the PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of paint pictures. it uses the amendment and the assignment of color profiles. a detailed manual for the use of color profiles can be found in the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under color correction at the same time. this tool allows you to make sure that your camera or your scanner always need the same error and therefore you will always need the same correction. in the manual for tape correction, you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility of exposure problems is the tool to gradation, that you find in a menu of Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digitization; tool Farbeffeffects provides you four colour effects, a solar control effect, a Velvia filter, an neon effect and an edge filter at your disposal.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing industry, Solaris also called the effect of a short flash plate. this was the effect that the brighter areas were darker and the colours were detected by the second illumination. this tool was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity of the solar panels. at about 50% intensity shows the picture of the chemically possible. an additional increase was to be a negative picture, so not on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar control panel. the original image is the (1) and the processes (2). applied intensity lies at 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; -effect. it differs from a saturation that he has a stronger contrast effect has the colors, and blistering makes. try it simply, it is more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for one on daylight-optimised color vision of the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. Velvias has strongly saturated colors but also some photographers, especially those who hardly have landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates Neonlight to the contrast. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the shooting down the strength of the Neonlichs. at large pictures the filter can hold the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras have often correct problems with light conditions and it's not unusual to change the color contrast of your photos. all your alignment can be viewed in the menu. as soon as you are satisfied with the result, you can use the button on the button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you have a picture at bad light conditions, you can get a good choice for brightness / saturation. even in this case you can look at your saturation. all changes you can look at the preview. if Him like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Contrast to the complex tool Gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / Gamma is a tool-correction for improving exposure. even if the dialogue is very complicated in this tool, you need to check out the case for use of the shooting. concrete the three shooting below the histol.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a Graphs of intensity values, a histogram, the active edge as well as the selected range. under the graphs, three cabs can change to change the image values to change the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is the regulator to move, and to pay attention how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and preview of the image can be viewed as a preview of the image is dynamically, using the settings of the image, updated on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling with this selection box can be displayed whether the histogram has a linear or logarithmic Y axis. if the large areas include a constant color, the linear Histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic organization is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three regulates: the top for the dark sounds, the average for light notes, the lower tones for the middle sounds, often gamma values are called.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour pinpettes can be used in the preview of the original file, to adjust the input of the shade, middle and light notes automatically. furthermore, there is a button for automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">The entries allow you to modify the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two regulating systems, e.g. the compression of the outputs can be used as a background to create a little picture as a background to something different in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, image values will automatically set automatically on the image values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save and store: with these buttons, the selected values in the filesystem can be saved and later again. furthermore, the Gimp levels is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">When you use these mode and the three colour pipettes, you want to use them for all shade, funds, and Sundays. click on the preview of the original file for rotational, green, blue and flash channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option covers all colour channels to find all colour channels, to find the combined result of all channels. this is a indicator, that is, you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the alignment of the input in red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and Alpha-channel, as well as the outputs are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected image (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the originals and the target picture is indicated. the preview is dynamic on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifications: this selection box allows the channel to specify the channel by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this cheese, two symbols have been taken to change between a linear and logarithmic view. the linear mode of the linear mode of a constant color, the linear mode also generates a wide beams. in this case the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move into a curveil into right, for example the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds can be dark with darker obliteral corals, and that they are darker darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos show a red mark on the corner. if you change this mark on the curve that will change the original value. create a point on this line and move the value up to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Store and shop: with these buttons, you can make it exactly. each curve you can use this file system and later will be loaded in the filesystem. the file format is the Gimp Kurvenformat.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you create these method and the three colour pipettes, you want to use the curve for all channels of the shadow, Central and Sundays. click the original picture to set the control points for the Rot-, green, blue and Luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option is controlled by an indication of the color channels. if in more than one channel, you will receive the combined result. this is a indicator, that is, you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo, which was fixed in the Luminous canal with the color pipette and mounted on the curves. the original image is (1) and corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixers of the digitization; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or changing the color of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another high-designed tool to blend the color shades of the images. you can work in the menu colours channel-Mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel-resistant box, you can choose the color to the histogram, allowing you to correct the channels using the relative distribution and rash. the left-section of the Fensters shows you a preview of The original can be seen as a comparison on his own riders.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target group has a red marker. if you appear in the picture position, vertical line appears in the histogram to give you the appropriate color.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls are on the right below: if you change the appropriate color components, and if you change the appropriate color components, the channel blender will then change the option to generate great black-and conversions of your photos. try the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you want Monochrom, the reduction of a colour to a visible part of the colour space. however, if that's the case you can use your monochrome conversion so you can improve the colour space at first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The memory used as and store buttons are exactly to this purpose. any other mixers can be used to store and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option covers all colour channels to find all colour channels, to find the combined result of all channels. this is a indicator, that is, you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in the blue Channel. the option Luminance is activated. the original image is below (1) and the beware image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstract ability. with the development of digital photography, black / white is always able to convert colour images simply on the computer. also with a set of film rolling profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford, 4 Plus, Ilford FP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford's XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lint filter. this looks good, with all the scenographic images and paired particularly well in portrait against the sky. thus, similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filters.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange filter filter. this improved landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. thus, like the 002 Cokin (tm) orised filters.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filters: simulates a black / white film screen with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic heaven effects and can simulate moon phases to the day. therefore, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) RotFilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural colour correction and improved the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and with similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm light and medium sounds while he is a bit cold in the scattering of a Drucks and the re-development of a sepiece. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digious; tool texture, you can apply decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding an texture to your image, whether it's a color picture on a screen, a pop music portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall. the menu entry image can be used on image processing.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter to the right increases the pressure of the depth or three dimensional of texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textured image is applied on the picture below. the original image is shown (1) and changed under (2). the parameter relief has been on 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">First, a decorative frame can be added with the & digious; tool frame can be added to a decorative frame.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of an amount of interest in the boundaries of a photos is not easy task. it's a psychological barrier to watch the eye. this is a psychological barrier for the remote eye. under the image, the module can be launched from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, the picture with a colored line, niepce leaves it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and-white images), shkantet it is ideal for a push-dimensional effect and decorate a ornamental frame with a patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: is the width of the frame in percent. the value area is limited to 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This is also bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio is greater than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the pressure of images, especially if you have used the tool to cut the aspect ratio previously.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can add simple a formatted text in a picture at any time. this is also possible to multiple occasions if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. use the text and place it with the mouse. if you need to adjust the character set, the character must be bigger, the character must be greater part of the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setup, which you have changed for your text, can be changed to the button "OK." after the image was saved once, the text is part of the picture. it can't be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">By the & digious; tool templates you can use a templates on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu picture Schablone can be used in image processing, to put templates on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">If you don't have any restrictions on the size of the template's size. if you want to add your templates (9) to use the PNG file format and you simply send an e-mail to the & digious; mailing list of the digitiff-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool to use the button, you have to set your template file with the button. select the file into the template. select the files in the box files. these settings will be added to the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root-makers for the templates has been re-reflected a building view, which is remarked by the template's office structure. the selection of a folders updated the templates of templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the Entrance factor and change the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button increases the opposite picture. it is set to reed the mouse position. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrinks the mouse button. if you want to use the mouse button, if you want the template to use the mouse. if you want the template for the whole picture, you'll have to use the image according to the left. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Postpone: do not use this button to move under the template. let's see the picture and place it in the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want the templates on your picture. the image will be adapted to the forefront-size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digipcame; provides three different tool to sharpening the sharpness. each of you has the advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Spicy is a traditional tool for sharpening of sharpness. it is very fast and easy to produce, but especially in dark fields, approved images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unparalleled mask-mask works on the contrast of the edge to look back. indeed, it is not able to remove atmospheric Dunes, making it a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and he is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is probably the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little complicated in his application and has different parameters to customization.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digging images need to install a common color. this is the same phenomenon that sharp edges can be printed on paper if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras require more usually using normal cameras for the private use.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images, a camera of internal sharpening can be applied. photos in the size of the same size, they must always be welded in during the processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners are using a sharpening agent already during the image of the image. if you activate this dedisable, you will receive control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can need usable results by using a photograph with sharpening of sharpness of sharpness. you can call with the menu entry into conducting sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="487">Should not be careful, however, the sharpness of countering the edge of the edges, but also increases the tool. in general, you can focus about the menu entry into conducting refocus. among the focus, you will find further information and comparison of all techniques to the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crispy. use the tool to tolerate with the menu entry, and experimented with settings. the forefront page on the right side of the dialoges shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masked is a very good tool to remove veil of your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original picture and preview the image can view the image and view the image of the filly with the latest settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. standard values generate often good results and should be at first. an increase in the amount of radius will make the effect. if you make the impactfe mask to do, smoking and create the impression of Graten in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is like many pixels on each side of a edge by the filter are affected. high-resolution images allow larger radios. you should therefore play images at the best in its final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the enchanted picture of the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The limit value is a split from the maximum RGB value and the amount of difference. you can use a minimum difference for the filter. however, these areas are avoided with a soft change between the killing of stripes and therefore Schönunited errors in remedies, Himmler and water surfaces avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of unsharp masked filter. the original image is the (1) and the image was used (2). sharp masked with a radius of = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digious; tool refocus is focusing on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the protected protected filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool is trying to give a photo to & quot; it is better to give it a photo called "FIR Vienna Filters." this is a better result of using the unbreaker-mask. refocus is mostly better results than unsharp masked. you can start playing in the menu by using colors Refocus on the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular case has a very long tail, which leads far from the source pix. in most cases, the FIR Vienna Inverse of Gauß 'is likely to be influenced by the most cases, so much more strongly influenced by the distant pixels. however, undesirable results were caused.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the main parameter for the module file. it is the most important parameter to use this module. for most images if your picture should amount to 1 good results. you can put a higher level if your image is very unsharp, but then it should be paid for holy.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation is possible to reduce the correlation. the correlation can be selected from 0 to 1. usable values are 0,5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation is reduced to the module's effect.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filters can help to reduce it by 0-1. however, values above 0-1 is much helpful. however, the image quality is very poor. however, the image quality is very poorly. a usable value is 0.03. a high value, the image becomes even more susceptible.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß 'sharpness: this is the most frequent cause of the palate. if you do not use this value to 0. if you do not use this value to zero if you use a value of zero, you may have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Mat size: this value is determined by the size of the transformation size, especially if you choose large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß '. note that the module is very slow when you choose large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The memory used as and store buttons are exactly to this purpose. each of any refocus parameters will have set it to be stored for later and then can be charged then.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all modulus, color and intensity recirtures on the picture before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image, before you change the image. for this reason, there is that a lot of operations are not visible immediately, but later added to unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read pictures and compressed, & eg; as JPEG, you should use the module to the uncompressed picture.</seg>
<seg id="508">In general, Unsharp masked better outcomes than sharpening of sharpness. this could be caused by sharp mring a bigger neighborhood as sharpening of sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, it has to remove the impact of the unspoilt filter. even under the optimal conditions it is possible that it is the result of the FIR Viennese Filters always at least as well as the unparalleled mask. the FIR Vienna Filters is often better for processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocusing image, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unclear colour image can be corrected. this picture was done with an analog camera. the infocusing result is due to sufficient light for the Auto-Focus Linse.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods to sharpening methods in digital images you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator Ginked puts the irculation of the range which was darkened to create a natural pupill.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinent allows the adapted color for the pupill. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool screens is one of the most extensive tool to remove it with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different freeware tasks as a starter points to make the restoration. the available Voices are below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to mount the filter settings, you can use the Reiter Getting and Advanced Settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Details: p [0], 100]: this is controlled by the details of the details. a value of 0.9 should be able to smooth surface and details. a value of 0.9 should not be retrofit. please note that, please refer to the details of the details.</seg>
<seg id="520">Alpha [0,100]: a small value of it evenly into all directions, while a value of 1 can only be used in one direction. if you have a film option or CCD room, JPEG Artefacts will be evaluated at a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0], 500]: this is the maximum Gläse factor via alles. p, then the relative moisture control. put this value therefore suitable to the degree of noise in your picture.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regulality: [0], 100] This parameter is specified. this is necessary to estimate the geometry of the image, it's difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbulletin, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: are often run on how often the algorithm is run. usually, here 1 or 2 is shown here.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle gradual angle [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic Alpha. if alpha is small, it should be too small. be sure that small angle create a long term. so you should choose this value as well as for your needs acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrators box [0.1, 10]: integrates pacemaker in pixel. you should avoid the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel-absorbing and never be larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation: the more to quality you get through the choice of this option is only low. it doubled the runtime. we recommend it to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons stores as and store exactly this. any setting of image errors can be rewritten in a text file, and then be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors is comparatively very quickly with the work. however, it can still take a long last long and a high CPU last time. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below, you can see how picture errors can be corrected with an analog camera. as you can see, there is a distinctive black film in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the journey. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitisation; Raues, is a highly powerful tool to reduce noise levels. it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heckel.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters for example, to remove spots and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor rents from the camera or morecounts; effects of injected images from books and magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor rhints of digital cameras, you can read these on English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen photo above shows a typical scene connected to a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a liqueworthy Rauschen, which can be successfully completed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following cases, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you need only the subwindow details and the subwindow settings can remain at the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius, the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) is required for the filter. large values improve / pixel. due to the radius, the image can be moved over the picture and the color into him will be polished and therefore smaller flaws will be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the filter distance to the front, and if it is increased, you will need to change the edges. if the value is too high, if you change this adjustment. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image may not be preserved and wrought more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge precision for the sharpness. if he is strong, the frequency response can be removed or to-scouts. put it on a value close to the maximum, if you want to remove a smoking, or JPEG, if you want to lose some details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminous tolerance of the image. we recommend using either color or luminance, to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the Glättle process which will be controlled by details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance, to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the Glättle process which will be controlled by details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase tolerance values of the darker ranges which typically consume stronger, however, the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: if it increases the adaptive filter radius on variations of the luminance. if he is increased, the canes will be able to occur when it can occur on his minimum, smoking and phase jitter to appear on the edges. it can be used to remove noise and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store and shop: these buttons are exactly used for making it. all parameters for smokers, which you have set up, can be stored in the filesystem, and later charged.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how smokers can change your life. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected (2). the bar has been used with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes it is a picture of crispy for your purpose. use the tool to define a bit soft as a picture. use the menu with the menu entry, and experimented with the gasket. the forehead on the right side of the dialoes shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digious; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools in photography of photographs.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unbeatable part of your images. it's very well-adapted to remove the images displayed in digital, original or subsequent digitised images, removing leaves and receives the content such as the human eye as the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for colour and texturing. the algorithms is carried out with a different tool consisting of the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. when a loss of compression was produced. it creates some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - a small standard set out in the uncompressed picture. this setting is to correct this problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons stores as and store exactly this. every setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file, and then reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very quickly with the work. however, it can still take a long last long and a high CPU last time. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below, you can reduce the notorious film (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can recognize the notorious movie approved on the core. the original image is under (1) and the corrected below (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see a further example of the photo restoration. this time, textures was applied to an old colour photo, which was used by scannerlighting and the photopaper paper. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digich; tool Hotpixel, it allows to remove hotpixel of photos which have been fitted with an CCD camera, eight of them were removed. it uses algorithms from JPEGPixi project, which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are particularly with high-quality raw mode pictures, as many cameras with JPEG compression over a built-in oppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixum quot; and "quot; bright Pixum quot; on a picture with a dark picture subtraitems. there is no manual method to select the poor pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">This file into the assistant with the button dark. the tool is automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are produced in the picture show.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to discover the dark picture directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels due to CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as in the previous section, you should load the matching dark picture to the clear picture. an automatic processing of the dark images will be the bad pixel. note that the assistant to the last dark shows, and this automatically invites you to the next session at the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image and the image can help you back within the image. the foreshavers shows the copy of the filly with the latest settings. poor pixels are out in all stock areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels in the preview and the results of the filter. choose the best filter method to interpolishing these pixels blocks. these are the available filter:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: it is identified as an average of the neighbouring pixel. the resulting colour is assigned to all defective pixels per block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation it will be done separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all Pixum that have a distance from 1 of the pixel block (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim), or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolishing the defective pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to Pixelblock are pulled to calculate an bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolishing the pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are pulled out to calculate an bi-Cuban surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction for a color photo, out of a defective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, used. the original image was increased to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitization; Vignetination correction is a tool to correct the Vignetable, i.e. underscores corners, a picture.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle objects, especially which in the middle and large photo format, can be found in the middle and large photo format. instead & quot; vignetable quot; (shady) they could reduce the edges and edges of the image by putting the light to the sensor. teleobjects can also show this behavior under circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it has also cons. many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the stop-stop filters so that it is impossible to keep the camera with hand. wide-angle objects should also be able to use center filter, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise untightened effects arise.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure of today's film and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter. the transformation with a Centerfilter is applied to an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three shelves, you can control the Vignetination correction file, and with three other the exposure of the target.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter is controlled by the largest density of filters. the default density is 2.0, or randomly a luminous thickness of 1, or randomly a luminous thickness of 2, or randomly to compensate the density by a larger degree of Vignale.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leucine, contrast, gamma-settings: editing a picture with the correct weight loss. you need to adjust the exposure of the target with these options. the pressure provides you only positive values, as you have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a hostile-adjust of exposure to the target, you can use the values / contrast / gamma at zero and use the Gradation from the & digious; image processing from the menu of Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetination correction for a picture. the original image (1) shows the image to the corners and (2) the corrected image. a luminance and contrast correction was also performed at the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & delivery came; Linsendistortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. non-inheritable distortion can't be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second Grades treats the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can be corrected the concave or conform of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third Grades has a similar circular effect, flaxed down to the edges. this correction is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient can be adjusted from the corners to the second grades. if you can combine these two shapes, every geometrical adheres can be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the second Grades. with negative values can be corrected and adjusted positive values.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion parameter as in the middle of the picture. for most lentils it has the corners parameter, the parameter to the parameter's parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the picture size and performs a correction of the first grades through. negative values increase in positive the picture.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value increases the brightness of the picture of the picture. negative values reduce the brightness of the picture in the corners, while positive values are increasing.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, you can illustrate the seal with a preview of correction, you will be stored for your picture, stored and when the next start will be used as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tons. or cold-shaped correction should be carried out in front of all modulus or size changes. if you want to cut out this correction than all the first. if you have a picture of the picture, and then it would like to carry out a picture-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent.</seg>
<seg id="586">To give you the best corrects you can see it. move the mouse button to be fixed in your picture and press the left mouse button to be fixed at this point. in the connection, you can correct the tonholes / kisal distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you have a kisal distortion parameter, the resulting image of black corners is transverse. you can remove these with the cutting tools in the menu, remove from image editing or using the zoom regulator to this Dialogs.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tonhole-shaped correction is sufficient for some motifs, such as recordings from the front, frame and paintings, it is the perspective in the picture 90 degrees. please note that when you keep the camera with the hand, you will always have a slight dip in the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonsils on a church in Norway. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the Gimpguru.org website. filter is produced by the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the foot you can select the area for the preview. if you select the red-rectangle with the mouse, you can consider the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can simulate two parameters of film projections and film-sensitive film. the ISO regulates the amount of film and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the conversion. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filters color channels are missive with infrared film, especially the green, makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs because the colour is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-filmeager for a landscape photograph of New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the image was set up under (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of Aura in the hairline.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digitisation is an easy-to-use tool to produce films on your images. this is known from classic high-speed films like the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known for the sensitivity of the films, and the manufacturers of great silver medal at the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The approved image effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move into the past. if you want to get out this special, gallery-like, street photografical, graining sight specially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator is calibrated the ISO-sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the body. the default value is, even higher values are needed to apply ISO-2400. if you need even more body, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the approved nostic effect on a black / white picture. the original image is the (1) and the beacon (2). the used film contains ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digious; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it is used to create a protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digious; filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice appearance, like an oil paintings. nature pictures and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulator to affect this effect. the upper chooses the brush size between one and five. thicker brush are better for great pictures. smooth the leaves, or, from the other hand side of the hinge.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and the beacon is marked with the (2). pinout size is 1 and Ginkte 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digitizer; filter coal drawing is used in drawing colour and hence they are not ideal for this effect. it's helpful to imagine that scene you would like to have the scene you would like to catch up. this would be good pictures to catch up.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knobs select the bottom size from and the bottom adjust the contrast (Ginkte).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon-filter filter. the original image (1) and the altered picture (2). the standard settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result is further improved by adjusting the intensity of intensity.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & delivery came; filters engraving with your image in 3-D, when it was marked in wax. it has been used to create a protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiur; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your images with a simple structure, in which color is not the most important content of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity, to turn the image into a gray, common landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, the default setting is.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the beware image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group, you can create a normal photo into an artwork by using dispersal effects. it is used to use the protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: shares the picture in cells, and leaves it, as if it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wavelength 1 the image is broken here with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need a long time for calculating and generate a high CPU load. you can break this effects at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group, you can create a normal photo in an artwork by means of infusion effects. it is used to transform it-protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom unshark: don't know the picture along the sternas lines out of a focus. this simulates the unspoilt camera and generates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial Unity: don't know the image by turning of the pixel, to a focus. this simulates the infusion of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Removal of removal: don't know the image to generate a non-focussing camera. the object seems to come back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion unparalleled: don't know the image due to horizontal motions of pixels. this simulates the infusion of an linear, z: B: by a car or train fotografia, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft touch: it gives the picture of soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates pictures of a portrait and a smooth focussing effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or to add a warm and subtle glar.</seg>
<seg id="620">Contaminant: don't know the image by random deportation of pixel, and simulates the infusion of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Unity: finds the colour basin in the picture and let them need to change these without the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the picture in rectangular cells and created it, by the filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need a long time for calculating and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore break this calculation at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The Regentropes are a nice small tool to make Regentropes on your picture. thus, it gives the natural your images a bare look. it uses a pieter Voloshyn urheberlegally protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drip size does not allow the size of the size of size. as the drip size is not necessary to reduce the size of small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes changes the optical effect on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can stick with the & digitization; image editing a range of Regentropes. do not use the selection, for example a face to stay freely. if you start the filter Regentropes, the range will remain in the area.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentropes Filters. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset on the picture (2) indicates a sunset on a storm. the standard values have been used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo is the wrong orientation, so you can find it through spike or spin into the right orientation. the tools can be transforming out in the menu of transforming threshing or transforming side.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo shoot is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo to enlarge with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The great question is simple, as you can stick to a picture, as you can reach the limits of the resolution? how can you see the lack of information or guess? the CImg algorithm is used here, making a good work. try him and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size, you can change it to the desired size with the tool size, select transforming size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialogue is below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to size, uses a linear interpolation method to handle the pixels. if you want a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge The picture. the underlying algorithm picture was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You don't need to change the tool such as you want to change size. these settings are available in the riders and below are below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio: if this setup is activated, the input of the new size will retain the aspect ratio of the original size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regulality: [0], 100] This parameter is specified. this is necessary to estimate the geometry of the image, it's difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbulenzeneffet, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons can be used as and store exactly. each infeed for photography can be saved as a text file and later again.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo vens is very fast at what it makes, but it can still take a long last long and a high CPU last time. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of a picture of a picture above, by a small color picture on the double size. the original (1) and the enlarged picture (3) is the result of a linear binding enlargement.</seg>
<seg id="640">The assignment of a photo is not just a common type of operation, but also a common tool to cover a picture. in order to cover a picture with the mouse, pressing the mouse button and draw the rectangle, you'll see this rectangle and move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you want to get the mouse button, you will get a good overview as your photo to the cut. thus, you can change the size of the rectangle by using the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle create by simply with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">As soon as you are satisfied with the cutting edge of the picture knob to the tool bar and photo is cut off (Ctrl; + X). use the entries in memory or file memory under the menu file to store the new cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the building area, you can change the size of the rectangle by setting the corners of the mouse. the aspect ratio, which you have defined in the dialogue, you will receive.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool after aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in the high format, the larger value of height and cross-format is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">Depending on the aspect ratio, this means a relative aspect ratio. this means that it's always like if you use centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the Dialoes, two buttons exist to extend the range of horizontally horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below the dialogue you can end up with the Max. ratio knocked to the area for the maximum possible level, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After aspect ratio (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are stored as standard values in depending on the orientation. the modified image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data will be readapted to the cut picture, and not the original picture.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the integration aid allow assistance to the help to put your images better, so that you can also make your images better:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic subspecies are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-party, harmonic triangles are one of the possibility to divide it in a similar harmonic triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden middle is a division that offers a split of different natural growth, such as the spiral of a Nautilus mussels or blebs of a sunflower. it is available in all possible things that we see as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The gold division is the irrationale number 1,618033988... and you were used by the old Egyptians and Greeks designed to design the gold division in all times when you use your images, buildings and even photos put together to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is directed by Fibonacci episode 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where any number one after 1 is equal to 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition of this rule will be seen as a visual harmonic.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle is liquid relief lines at your disposal if you put together a painting. this can be counted below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirale will get to get closer to your photos. in comparison to the third-party, the Golden Spirale can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition runs the view of the viewer along the line of spiral and aimed at this kind a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule are the right corner of the golden spiral, too. it should be something that the eye can be at heart of the composition. that can be a line, or different objects. this can be just because of the eye, it's easy to carry out his task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles are also directed by the sides of the sides of the golden tones. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no longer triangles. diagonal can be found on these lines.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame in order to break your frame. try your image focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that can't be different.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic partition.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button, you can set the color of the relief lines. if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast, the relief lines can be invisible. on this type, you can adjust the color of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture by any angles.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you do a picture, then it's easy to keep the camera to stick or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things can repair your digitization; image editing, and the tool free press. select transforming free web press and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the shooting angle. the values can set up to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation can be set to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the rear side. the new dimensions of the image will be displayed above.</seg>
<seg id="664">To your help you'll find a horizontal and vertical line at your disposal. after taking over an important point of the image, you can fixed him with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After passing a picture, they will be able to find an unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one possibility to repair this function is the function transforming cutting of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture to cut the picture. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing smooth the picture a bit after turning. please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectivan transformations are carried out to a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to change the red quadrate at the corners of your image. the preview will then be recharged automatically. on the right side of the dialoges, you will find some information about the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: the width of the new image, including the empty areas were created by the transformation through the transformation.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas made by the transformation through the transformation.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: shows the current angle in degrees in the upper left corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees in the upper right corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angles right below: shows the current angle in degrees in the lower right corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the image becomes a little bit. for one single customization, this effect is small but two adapts generate a double-strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After the perspective, they get unjoyful holes at the corners. one possibility of this is to be able to cut the image with transforming cutting edge from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The switch is used to postpone part of the image to the right and the other part to the right. this is no rotation, the picture will be broken. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module about transforms.</seg>
<seg id="679">Check your image by using the Horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can press the angle to zero and will be reset to zero. a preview of the Effects will show you and the new dimensions of the target will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help get a vertical and horizontal line. move the mouse to a key point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to be fixed the lines. you can now use the switch tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have carried out the image, the image will be disrupted, however, for one single lubrication, this effect is usually negligible, but two sprays, as much as the devastation and hence should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the lubrication, the image has an impressive triangular holes in the corners. one possibility to eliminate the image with transforming cutting edge from the image processing.</seg>

<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and the conversions result. JPEG uses a loss of loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all of your image and use the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you're looking forward to edit your images or later, you should not use the JPEG format because there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose to select the metadata with the RAW file in the RAW file, the JPEG file is stored in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you are adapted to your settings, you can start with the conversion button. if you want to break this process, you can break this process.</seg>

<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the Fensters you can browse all pictures according to certain names, as you can see in the picture. here, after images, however, not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user's user book for & kphotoalbum; if you don't want to read your books, but rather would like to try out the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Walk on the home of & kphotoalbum; and look at the rapid-entry, the screen photos and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and choose in the first dialogue, if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or choose the menu entry into the menu entry. then, some example will be uploaded and you can try the inner functions of & kphotoalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you want to print this manual, you can find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as an associated HTML document for downloading.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the lower edge of the main fensters of & kphotoalbum; see the timeout. a picture of this is shown here: how the name already says, this is the list of your data statistics via the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The time bar can show you several different time units. each body shows you a different unit. you can change between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. click on the picture you will see a part of a database by using the LEICA only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The time you can use the entries you can change your database (if you select a date, you'll see the first picture of this date in the preview window) and shows the time the current date of the currently shown images if you want to navigate in a preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of time. select the mouse button to keep the mouse button, so if you select a range of time, you will be displayed in the preview of this period. you can break the selection by clicking on a bar at the time.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; you can create two options available HTML websites with your images. one can be integrated in & kphotoalbum; integrated in the following section of the user interface, integrated in & kphotoalbum; integrated version described via the menu (HTML file).</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML-pages you will need some settings: these are divided into the three areas of contents, layout and goal. in the following, each section will be described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overcks and a description, which may contain the HTML file later. click on kphotoalbum; HTML-example-pages see an example for this settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose from whether a & kphotoalbum; export file, should be created on the map page. nutrients can find information about the export files.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last, you can choose which information on the HTML pages are supposed to be selected. for example, you can't make sure that all pictures are exported. you can't use all the pictures. you can't use this setting, so that you can't use certain images before certain amount of amount.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can designate how to look like HTML-pages. most insight options are clearly, which is why not specifically for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="923">Down on the page you can adjust different resolutions for the pictures. thus, those need to look at your website and have a monitor, which have the maximum resolution 800x600, for example, which, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer your site can change the resolution anytime, which means you can change your images with low resolution, as well as for a lower transmission time, search. if he would like to get a picture bigger, he wants to get a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this single production area, the various folders and the URL may be stored where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">For all your HTML files, select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subordner for every subsequent sentence.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored. this file is stored and select a file for all future images. here you can select either a file or a KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check whether this URL will be ready for viewer. if you were created for the base file, the URL should be set here, this file should be set here. otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong file.</seg>
<seg id="929">If you have the HTML files even in the final destination, you'll have to copy it manually. thus, the import function, see, right, you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subordination of the current files, but the basic file is located in the folder.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just above described possibilities have all three on basic file and URLs. in these, a sub-file is created, whose name is set in output file.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you come to a family party, meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, you may need to create a HTML site with these images. however, if you have already checked the images that you have to bring images on the images, shooting location, etc., you have to make you with & kphotoalbum; these work do not even make this work even more.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can also import other into your database. photo features are added with ex- and import.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they can be stored in the file, or if you are stored in the file, it's advantage of all images in the file, so that you can easily cover all images together, and that file doesn't keep the file size, however, the file size is.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can download a .kim file either directly from the menu file, edit... or together with HTML-pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this is an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">There is an external .kim file looking for two times. first, the images of the URL are stored in the file's file. this is, of course, if you're looking for HTML's HTML files. this is of course only possible when you create your .kim file using the HTML-Export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following dialogue, the dialogue is described by images, which you can read about the menu file, export...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialoes is to be able to negotiate with internal or external .kim files. there are you following three selection possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="938">When the option is installed in the .kim file, you will have to copy the images in the same file as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option, you copy the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the pictures automatically automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal gypp files. because most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG files and the XML file itself very small, it's worth the files to compressed files. if you want to use this, simply select the option to compressed the option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is a maximum picture size. if you are like to send your friends pictures, as the .kim file is very big. here you can limit the size of the size by setting out that each picture is 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file Impact... select, & kphotoalbum; the exported database was described as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">Assistant to the importing consists of four steps. first, you need to select what you want to import or import images, then in which folders should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is possible that you have to import the category for the import file persones (if you are a Dane), while this category should be saved in your database. therefore, you'll be able to import the categories of imported file, and these categories are to be used in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can specify the categories of the import file with the categories of your current database. an example here you see on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse pictures and view: if you see images, you want to view pictures of your Italy's holiday and see a picture with your friend, you would like to see all pictures of which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will find the different steps from (1) fixed to the information about your images, through (2) the search and pick up to (3) advanced topics and customization.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was started as a program for managing your images. but it has been extended and today, it does not include your videos. at many places in this manual, more images is spoken, but often includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbums; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top file of their pictures. this is a simple XML file that you want to modify with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy on a disk or revisions in the CVS, you can secure it.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; if you want to check out the files stored in & kphotoalbums; if you want to launch another database with images, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the option -c start. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">About the menu entry settings are kphotoalbum; set up on a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbums; in the following section of the user interface, you'll be explained in the following section of the user's menu.</seg>
<seg id="952">You can see six different symbols, with which you can read a preview of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setup, you can call for a detailed help to the F1 key and one click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">In it you described, as you can designate for each picture, for example, persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialogue, which is used to process existing groups. for each existing group you can select a labelling and select a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section the categories were already mentioned in the categories. in the dialog, you can address full board groups, i.e. all members of a group on once in a group, instead of all groups of a Mittgliding as described in.</seg>
<seg id="956">You can see the settings that are available at the top of the board groups. in the top of the top, you can select the category. in the left side, you can select a list with the current category and in the right list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares his modular system with other graphics applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & KDE; image plugin interface. nutritional information you will find on the site of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called by the modules. however, the modules can not be described in this manual, as they are not part of & kphotoalbums; but most modules have one help to call via the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">As the modules used by several applications have been used together, you can check out the modules with the demo database. so, you can check the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum-Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help. let's not say, I would not be warned!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI common are very different, so it can be very different modules with & kphotoalbum; not work. this is the repart if you want functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The largest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that do not use KIPI, is an album simply feature a file. even if the order is not supported, simulates it for some modules the order for albums, so you can use the functions with & kphotoalbums;</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album which is simply the current view, so all images that shows you the picture show at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kphotoalbum; the modules also have a list of albums out. here's & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser indicates the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then every entry of this category is a record for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category called for virtual albums, it will be used as a category for virtual albums, so if you want to use the category persons, it will do so, whether you have selected persons to view and this module will be on the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">As some modules with & kphotoalbum; not compatible, you can remove these from the list of modules. restart the settings dialog, and select the modules, which modules are charged.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start-screen, once you start & kphotoalbum; with your own images start.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you can view it from any other KDE applications, you can't see the window with your image database. in the section we'll see on this window but then click here to the entry images that shows you an overview of all the images displayed.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; it's the possibility to see each picture with notes, where the image was recorded either individually or for a larger number of images certain remarks at the same time. if, for example on all pictures Jeper, and all images have been shown in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsen as you can read in the section. if you want to see this comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In case you can see three lists with a text box by using persons, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; because they always use it again, if you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is the insert of the images within the list are: if you have shown a family party and on all 50 images the same 5-10 people are shown, so that the names used to be moved to top, which can be more quickly and rewritten.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to use an alphabetical list, click the symbol for Soring to date under the list.</seg>

<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark this pictures and use the menu item multiple entries to one note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all available in the USA. there are San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you will see a browser window of the USA as well as it shows. to indicate that it is a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the remarks: it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new category or category category. attention, this is an entry to make this entry into a sub-category category. attention, this is that you're looking forward to your categories alphabetical.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comments dialogs by adding the body to form the outer edge of frame, and move. you can also make up their own window by taking it outside the window area.</seg>

<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, however, is a name that recognize the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the box size, you can wear the width and height of the enumerable image. if you want to renown a small area of picture, you choose the section of the section and enter the image into the input section.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Set in the drop-down quality, you can use the properties tab, which is used by a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuse reflection-lighting. an exhaustive description of the installation features can be found in the user's guide book & Povray;</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture comes out with just a straight pixel, several errors arise. these images often have a moirè patterns and lines and lines, they are not displayed as if they are in the representation smaller than a pixels. this effect is Aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing, to reduce the influence of this mistakes. generally, pictures of this feature is better from the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn anti-aliasing and connects & Povray; more than one strahl per pixel, this technology is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">It supports two methods of super-sampling. the second method is adaptive, non-recursive method; adapting, because each Pixel continues to be split and adapting again because the calculation of the calculated values depend on the calculated values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray a Strait pixels. if you calculate the depth of a specific number of pixels with super-sampling. if you calculated the depth of a specific number of pixel, a copy of 4x4 extra points will be calculated with a depth of 5 to 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixels. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel, when the difference between the color values, then the pixels is divided into 4 subpixel, the individually can be pursued and checked, the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another option of the aliasing effect is reduced by the creation of smoking process, called Jittering. if you turn off Jittering, changed & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setup for quality of the Renderns is diffuse reflection. this is a experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflexible. it takes a very long to calculate a scene with this capacity.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this box map, you can set whether the alpha-channel by POV-Ray are supposed to be calculated. a pixel, then transparent, if the used beams are not made.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for the display of the & Povray; -solete issue. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason for this reason.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene to import, select the menu entry file for importing... and select a file from the analog window.</seg>

<seg id="1057">To import objects from object tree in the Editor to import the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code to import text file in the editor. in order to import objects into the scene, just mark the source code in the editor, and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With head and insert in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor, you can also add source code for & Povray;</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene is renched. this is the POVRAY and x-POVRAY.</seg>

<seg id="1065">You can adjust the object of the points on the Raster in the context menu of the wire menu. you can set up the scanners, scaling, scouts, and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values also show a closer wire model to the displayed objects, but require more time to Renders. for some objects such as the ball you can set the detail stage for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you can rely on a lot of detailed projections, if the camera uses a extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of the perspective and vertical projections. this feature takes a better approach to projections, but requires more time to Renate.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you want to view a wall behind the objects, a wall behind the objects. the wall is shown in a chess set pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you view the floor, a soil is below the objects. the floor is shown in a chess set pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you activate the slope, the non-recursive antialiasing method used for rendering. the values for depth and swelling can be set. more precise data to the parameters can be found in the section Render-Modi.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can change existing windows and change new window directives. the window of the window is declared that you can create window-orders and store.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The standard window of the standard window system: shows all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of the window-orders will show all existing windows orders. a new arrangement allows you to add to the button to remove it and delete a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window order is identified by the name identified. the name must be clearly and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all the views of the chosen window arrangement. new views can add to the button to add a button with the button to remove the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">With new column you will create a new column on the right hand side of the new window, you can reach the window under the existing windows, with cartel card and set the view on a box view. this is not a view on the main window, but generates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you've just have & Povray; and now, you would like to start without precise knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should take the ultimate but easy scene at very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully have the following item, before you decide that you can only receive a black screen. if you are using a 3D program, you should please note these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't adjust the camera, no rules for rendering, as a result, you will receive a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't add lighting sources, your whole scene is in the dark and get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have all faultless installed, you see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window is set:</seg>
<seg id="1082">They take a bit time to learn the menus and the existing symbols of tool bar. read the documentation, so you can get an appropriate presentation that you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You'll need to use these menus and symbols are now often use, so you should check the menus and symbols, and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. in order to follow this guidance, you must remove all objects from the object tree. mark the scene and then select the menu entry of edit. so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The Wireless model view shows how the camera shows the entire scene you create. in particular note that in the fourth wire-view view (right below). this is the view of the camera from the camera. this shows you the result of the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree has now includes a new entry with the name camera. if you click on, see the content of the exhibition properties, which will find the different parameters of the camera. in the user document to & Povray; you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing to the basic settings of the camera, it's later to reference to the camera that you can change the camera in the camera, with which you can change the camera in the camera. click just off the left mouse button to a control point and drag him to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button on the button, the wire-model beliefs and object tree would immediately change these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many possibilities to create the ground for the scene. you could add a quel (add mader) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a consistent method for the solution of this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; in fact, it offers a simpler ability to use. you can use a endless level as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: choose the plain in the object tree, change the name and press the knob button. in the object tree, the new name is immediately displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The open model view now also shows the level, even if there is a limited level, even if you have the scene you renders, the level goes up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you want to see the object's object, if you can see the object's entry + before the object. in this case you will find the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. choose one of these options, modify the possible settings in the object of object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should use the bottom to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, so that you can get to learn some of this parameter, and select the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Choose only the floor in order to set up its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose from a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases there is a dialogue where you can choose to select the object of object. however, the pigment will be displayed in the object of objects (name = floor-pigment), with one click on the button you can look like the pigment now looks like the pigment.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, this preview of Pigments only has a matt black material, because you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on a preview. also, you can now use the colours for the pigment. so there are many possibilities for the pigment.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't want to see any color on Quader and ball, click the button on the button to go and call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now correct. if you get your image now with one click on the symbol, you should obtain the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course these are not the colors. in the color list, you must have two new attributes. in the color list, you'll have to do this entry twice (you can also do it more frequently, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colours):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Choose in the object tree for jedesmal, and change the colors in the view of the object features:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should you just run, as you can simply do the fundamental work of & kpovmodeler; already, the ball is just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the object features, you can't change the settings for a radius: on 1 (don't forget the input button or to press the knob), making the ball over the bottom, as you would have shifted a unit into the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, Renders are now a weird result: as already before, the ball surface is like a mattes Black material. put in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now show a material. as in the floor, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose to choose the object, and change the name for example in ball pigment. click on ball pigment, then select the colour and put the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach the more interesting effects, if you take the time, some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Change the values like in the following screen photos and click the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings glamour and reflection results in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-plated surfaces, even if metal is not chosen:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what you want to create & kpovmodeler; we've already learned as much as you know, but you can create simple, but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraytracing is a rewritten method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you have a scene of raytracen, the camera is calculated using any pixels in the scene. the camera is reflected in the scene, and it is broken, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how the atmospheric effects of the light sources have relied. so the scene is done in pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see, the camera is your eye where you can see the scene. without a light source, you will also see the picture, the picture is simple. obviously, each scene is to be appointed, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialogue you can select your file. POVRAY files are usually the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialogue you can select a file, which you have previously prepared with & kpovmodeler previously.</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create a new model, the file is inserted into this submenu, and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it is stored under the same name, it is a new file, you'll need to enter a name and a storage space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">The scene is reprinted in the last stored version. all changes since the last store are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only select only if you are not stored in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last rewards command. this menu entry can only select you, if you have to do with editing.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window adjustment and opens up a dialogue, in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or a existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you can find options for the setting of & kpovmodeler; here you can change the appearance, keyboards and the standard behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens up a dialogue for the change of the keyboard shortened. you can change the short release for & kpovmodeler; -commands change or new.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens up a dialogue with the tool of tool bar. you can add with this option Tool Works for & kpovmodeler; -commands and removing.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-map is a way to change the surfaces, without any beekeeping on the surface of individually, without changing the geometrical form of the lenses itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file as well as a dump map as well as an texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometrical forms which you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models will then be processed to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture-map is a possibility to give the surface of an object colour on pixel-based application, using an image file as a colour card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; it is a convenient picture of picture and browser. the application has a file browser, which you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Pictures can be shown either in a window in size of the image or in full-mode mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files you can view it with clicks of the & LMBn; or the key Return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust whether each picture will be displayed in a window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a certain file, simply take the first signs of the filename in the right corner. if a suitable file is found in the right corner. when a matching filename was discovered, the file is caused by Return from Return or to Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the dialog elements - & kuickshow; there are five card cards. in three of them, General and editing and Diasshow, you can set up the work on the display and intersection for the browser, can be set to the keyboards for the respective window.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If the image is selected, the images will be open in full mode. if the image is not big enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display is filled with background colour that you can view below. default is no full-mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">If this point is enabled, invites & kuickshow; already the next image in the file, while you can see the next image, if you choose the next image, and it is especially suitable for diasshow.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option you saves & kuickshow; at the end of the last open folders. at the next start & kuickshow; these folders in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click the colored beams to select a background colour. this is used to fill the background color mode in full mode. if in window mode the window is larger than the picture, the picture is filled with the selected color.</seg>

<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions can be used either the command line program dcop, or the something comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functionality, therefore it is rather your taste and the way of your task, to give you the accompanying programs.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the command line program dcop. to ensure that, you must make sure that & k3b is started. then, you should make something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions that have all & KDE; they have, supports & k3b; mostly two other parts, which are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP-interface from & k3b; provides features such as copyCD, format DVD, and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">COPRef createx CDProject () DCOPRef createx CDProject () DCOPRef FrayDvd () DCOPRef FrayDvd () void-Dvd () void-Dvd () void-Dvd () void burnCdimage (CURL URL) void burnDvdImage (URL URL)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you can use a project via the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project by using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject! reference is possible to modify the project via K3bProjecta.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the top of a large K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is only available on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring URL, QString Parent) void remover (QString Parent) void removeItem (QString Quartet) void renameItem (QString Quartet, QString newname) void setupID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and files from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple files and add files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b) dcop $PROJECT createFolder test / foo dcop $PROJECT createx / home / trusteg / Somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>

<seg id="1495">& Customer Service (for the read of & CD; data in WAV files on the hard disk) and by many co-files (lossfree compression) is supported by default (these codierer packages are still installed from the Linux distribution). additional coders can be added to the program (if they have installed them).</seg>
<seg id="1496">At first, the title of the & CD; read and read in WAV files on the computer (lossfree and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually a per title) compressed in the MP3- or OGG format or as well as other formats such as lossfree FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step that read the & CD; it is compiled by & kaudiovia; cdparanoia. almost any distribution has compiled a precompiled package: if that's not yet installed, it must be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other coils are already installed. however, all these programs are not necessary to compile it. however, if FLAC is not used, the installation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">What is to use the encoding / file format? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction of codierer, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for coping audio CD; s: as already said, cdparanoia uses the protection of audio CD; it is not possible to use an protected audio CD; even if not use the mechanisms of the copiprotection. avoid the purchase of copied audio CD; it's simply the purchase of copied audio CDs; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">During the set only one should be done (the setup dialog, but so often called to be called for a suitable configuration), the hard drive is declared to read a CD; the hard disk explains. this is going to understanding the slim approach of the user interface, which you can frequently take place at the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1504">Can & CD; information from the freedb from the internet or can be complete without a network, whereby everything is included.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is only a short list of the commands of the main fensters. on the side step by step, there are more information about how this program is used as well as in the descriptions of the Programme for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The CDDB request on the CD data is based on the CD-data in the CDDB tab. (this can be locally or online), in the latter case you must use the connection to the internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start and start - if a Encoder in the tab will be configured in the setup version - the coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">A sub-menu opens with a list of the available Encoder so that the choice can be read with another Encoder as standard settings. it's note that before the encoder is configured in the tab for the setup settings.</seg>
<seg id="1509">The file manager, so that a succesene file will be chosen to encode instead of a complete & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Open the setup dialog to configure the type of information (such as protocols, piepsen) for program events (such as read the & CD; ended).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Open the main setup dialog of & kaudiovia; with different card cards (such as Encoder, to set the encoders). hierhin you must go before the program can be used before the program can be successful!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes a sound quality, codierer and compression rates and helps you to choose the right track.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If any audio-information is supposed to go, an lossless audio format is needed. in addition to FLAC there are also other such as' shsites' or 'Monkey' which may be available for this distribution. the cons are low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices to play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats used, MP3, and OGG the most common. OGG like today a light advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrate (up to 128 kbps), but this bit rate will produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame will still be delivered with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (with high bitrate), but compared with OGG slightly lower quality.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG players are present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto-stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009, these devices are mostly the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= this setting provides good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= this setting is usually offer for most people and most music pieces of acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to $320. needs up to 320 kbps for complex pieces and less complex parts of the piece. good enough for stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. needs always need 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of titanium. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate approximately 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a titanium. good genug for music, portable devices and auto stereoscope. but not good enough for better HiFi-stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you don't have the highest quality, without looking at the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that will be added to manually or by the program automatically from the freedb program are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can use / needed with & kaudiovia; and the coding program to create the files and file names, as well as the characteristics of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with Komer programs, there are often a combination of program settings for the Kodierer and these parameters. the manual or help to the coalition may explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, add to the & CD; title to add MP3s with lame are encoded, the switch has to be added by lame and the title parameter from & kaudiovia; the result looks like: '-tt {5}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiovia; parameters which can be used (= button designation in the assistants):</seg>
<seg id="1530">That's what you can download the audio CDs that you can download the information on your computer. it's note that only from the text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legally, but I am not able to give information on the & CD; more or less valuable, so there is no need to be added to the music by the music. all information can be added with a Bummel by a & CD; business, physically or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & cold auditorium, the e-mail address can be used as the system used. in this type of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address will not be used when using the server (this can't be used, but only the programmer should be reviewed.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are many countries in many countries, copies of the main database. when & cold auditorium is set up, the geographically next to the next door system is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and the load between computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirrors for online call from & CD; information during the read of a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What's readout program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There is rumors that cdparanoia is used; who's more precisely, search in the source code... This was always the best choice for audio CDs; see. to note that the cdparanoia package from the matching distribution must be installed, if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To get the desired WAV files, the encoders can be chosen for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (an lossless compression for audio data) on the tab. other coils can be added to this map.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package has to be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the Kodierer can be used. this is also required for the defined codierer. more information about Kodierer are in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After the installation of a Colossiers you can receive more information about his switch, as lame-help or lame --help in a consolete window (eg; Console). it has to be replaced by the installed Koschame.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can check out many causes of device (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;), try both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could give an indication of what wrong is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy audio CD; read the handle of the & CD; this will not be gelingen!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step for step-by-step. even if you use other settings, this tips can return to tips as you go.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, everything understood, are still uncertain what do is? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information about how to establish those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we'll start the program for the first time, we'll be able to read all our first & CD; we'll be able to create MP3s with a VBR (variable rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 sample (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There are cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be used as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution, as it is not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source code to you, whatever you can do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the / usr / share / cd is that you own write (eg; they try to copy it with the counter-queror to copy).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals the basic set of & cold auditorium; something which is thought to be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for read a & CD, which must be repeated for each made & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we define the sound image quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 up to 256 kbps). since we are lazy where we are lazy, we share the program with that freedb to get the & CD; data from the Internet access.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings, we will likely be very likely to read a & CD; even if the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device driver device will be given to the reading program, so that it can read the & CD; data / pieces can read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">/ dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name. if that's not work with other programs, you can also see a look at the file / etc / fstab file and try out there with the existing entries of the device used for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">Card card general settings. here you don't have much to do. here, there can be an additional conversion. in our example, everything will be shown below, as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only For uncomplete information please select, so you will be informed if data are missing to the creation of sample (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">Card card CD; settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically be downloaded via the internet of a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer has to be connected during the read of the & CD; with the internet, it can be connected to the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop is easier, will start a & CD; this is with low risk-related directory entry or day entries, you can be easily changed. the directory or filename will be changed with conquery - &gt; umame and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & KDE; day.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to enter the database before. however, it's not possible to use the database. however, this is worth up to 620 MB, and if you're worth checking up, too, the two selection will be selected, at least the first. mode of mode is set up on the following card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedfor us. these are settings for the data on the Internet. how does the system you will get on the Internet. how does the system you will get the CD? read the section about freedb. set all such as it is shown in the screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we do not downloaded the database, we want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the page freedb.org and look after a mirror server in your proximity. however, this setting is distributed between computers. however, this setting will work as first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work on the server, because there are many firewalls the protocol 8880 standard format, maybe more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surf in the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to use any & CD; data on the freedb server must be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings of the screen photo. (make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">The number of places at the same time: for debt, there is a reason why there are more than one at the same time when using only one existing drive? parallel to reading and Coaching? the author knows it not, just trying to try himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after aligning the last piece: cross this to the & CD; at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom-defined files for temporary files are stored in which the WAV files are stored in which WAV files are stored in a private file. don't forget the files in a private file. don't forget to make this file if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All such as it is on the screen photo. the order is a bit long, under circumstances must be slightly damaged in order to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned earlier, the increase bit rate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note '--id3v1-only' for the constraint of tags to version V1 / V1.1st 'ID3v2, in case of a later amendment of tags.% f and% are internal variables for the names of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screen photo. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of the same time encoded WAV files: at a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine, it can be tried to encode more than a WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we've just finished the basic facility of & kaudiovia; this configuration is used as standard for each of a CD-CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it will be described as the process of reading on the hard drive. first, we will make a connection to the Internet because we are comfortable and the & CD; the process is described in this section. the process is described in this section, must be repeated for each application & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we are using a & CD; these are still not included in freedb. therefore, you can learn the & CD; you can learn the & CD; data manually, instead of pick up out from the internet. comments will be able to indicate the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try to find out the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, you must now have the & CD; into the drive, which is defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a brief moment the pieces should be listed and their length should be listed in the window, as shown in the screen photo. this only if the & CD; as audio CD; identified and identified by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD was able to be picked up from freedb, all titles of the pieces are already filled and in addition, the name of the artist and the album are indicated.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the case, there is more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; you will select a window, and you can select the database entry, in which your opinion is on the best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you don't have chosen the checkbox for the automatic query of freedb (on the side & CD; you can not have a local database, but if you don't have local database, but data from the internet, you need the connection to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD-editor - input of the CD-data and the Title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data on your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen photo. title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Upeller title', the rest of the data on the input box 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist does not have to be given no longer in the input box 'Upeller title', unless you have a composition with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom commentary box can be used for the individual comments of diel per piece, the commentary box of the album will be used for comments on all tracks of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after successful release of the data from freedb is not empty, but it contains a good idea to check the content of the CD-Editors, so that you are not only with the artists and album name (e.g. if all words with large letters will start or not...), but also to check whether it is any adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use ID3v1 tags. if you are using ID3v2 tag, you don't use unlimited fieldbus, at least on what is possible. this option is set on the board map by default settings; take a look into the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the day-information from the files later on any time with the day editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 Tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are supported by all coke or file formats. see the help to Kodierer in order to get more information on the assistance.</seg>
<seg id="1591">In this example, this is not essential because we don't want to use the style. for more information you can't go on the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found among rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After the election of 'OK' come back to the main window, click just click on line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-Editors will be back and you can see that the fields for the album have already been recorded for the first piece. just enter the entries for the field of current product. add the title of the piece on any case and other information you want.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click the next line on the main window and procedure you see in the same way until you have given all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is sorted into one of these categories.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. note that the artist and the album are indicated by the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there are an check-in before each line of a piece. make sure that all pieces are selected. make sure all the pieces are selected, or press the button on the bottom of screen to select all pieces on the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking on the button, it started out by clicking on the button, so this window will be on OK and then we will see a look at the window with the entries and track what runs.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the shift of orders on the order board. it is in the left upper half of the Fensters, directly under the knobs of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece will be read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the Fensters in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message you see if you try to work with a codierer, which you don't have successfully installed. pieces are not successful with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the file for the TMP file and the target file doesn't know what we have given here in the example. did you checked whether you have a write access to the folders for the temporary files and the target file?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear, why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece of it, but we finished it. but we have a new entry for 1 into the format MP3. in order to read and encode parallel. please note the status message in the lower part of the Fensters, it's now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration mode to suppress this behaviour, the number of parallel processes is the result. the used calculator with an AMD64 doesn't seem to read the problem for simultaneously and encode (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title will be read, while another piece is encoded, and a third order is encoded in the waiting-long turn. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a good time in the upper left part of the Fensters.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For successful use of & kaudiovia; you need & KDE; 3.00 or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the coordination of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you'll need to select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removing.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs will be played. if you choose the series from the menu-menu of the menu, choose the songs in the order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove or random sequence in the menu, the order is new.</seg>

<seg id="1652">This is essential for synthesizer, which are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-map General-MIDI events in events which understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-map showing all events of the type change patch to Bright piano in the change of type change patch to Trumpet converts and thus always play trumpet if originally a piano play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only a sound card, you do not need a MIDI-map, because all Soundcards are compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI-Maps. so you must edit the corresponding file of hand (with your favorite seditor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file that are all necessary settings for playing a piece.</seg>

<seg id="1658">DEFINE PATCHMAP... END DEFINE KEYMAP "A more Keymap"... END DEFINE CHANNELMAP... END Options... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that DEFINE is needed to show that a section begins (except for Options) and END that the end of an interval is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail, that I can use in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, how the patches of General MIDI will be displayed on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left-hand side of the equation is ignored. it is believed that the GM patents are in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order, and no row for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to lay all the tone for example. if your keyboard does not need to take a bug (e.g. with sound 60), you can find a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which like a riflation. do you apply the following in the PATCHMAP -section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI-file is a Note with patch 127 (riflation), it takes Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, irrespective of which are sound in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the concept of Trommel, Patch, Maracas & etc;), and not the one, in which the clay is the pitch of the same drum means (such as some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP Section is used to specify how notes on a specific channel or instrument are shown here:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Like the PATCHMAP -section, the order of lines very important, as their presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can use multiple KeyRoadmaps for each channel and define each instrument for each instrument. you need to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are used mainly to form notes on the percussion channel. look at the supplied KeyRoadmaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form some channels on others. if you want for example the first and second channel, you make the very easy to see in the CHANNELMAP -section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section, i.e. 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, rebuilt according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">If you use Keymap option, the keymap will need to be defined in the file. if you are using the ForcePatch option, you will need to change the patch on this channel. in this case, you will always use patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example, to use the Pertele-Patch on the Perkflash channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value of the Pitch-Bender events is multiplied to the Pitch-Bender events, and then it will be redirected to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then it will be redirected. the value of 4096 is used, so in the Map file doesn't have a decimalmas.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed, because GM announced that a keyboard that should play a sound with the value of 4096. but unfortunately, some keyboards are to play a octave up to octave. to try the right value on your keyboard, you need to try out a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-map, open the dialogue MIDI-settings. you can find in the menu under settings, point MIDI-settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole row of piano (one for each MIDI-channel). on this piano sounds you see what sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. if you have changed an instrument, the button is not possible on green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to display the mired sounds. view to the menu settings below the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo LCD shows the speed, with which a song is played. higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can find the pace of a song change. if you can find, one song is to be quick to follow the text, you can slow down the pace. to change the pace, you can use the arrows at the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played like a music piece. it contains the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes on very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't worry, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while using a good synthesizer, you can also use a similar sound quality. with a MIDI file, you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have to control the control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen when you have a binary distribution (rpm, Deb) of & kmid; because of the problem with the problem. to eliminate the problem, you need to download a source distribution and install (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole file to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree & kmid; Drag & drop. open the folders that you want to add in & Konqueror; choose all files out, and drag them to the & kmid 'window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, activate the Automatic start-up note, otherwise the files are added to the collection. otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can use the arrow-off left from the Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to re-manufacture the default, you can stick to the LCD double.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have done on a & KDE; a window with my MIDI file and & kmid; if I want to play a Karaoke file (if I want to play a Karaoke file) or want to play a file, only in the & Konqueror; window change the desired file into the window of & kmid 'window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file if you want to add a file, without them to add the setting, please turn the setting, and the new; file is added to the temporary collection of files.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let us assume you want to play the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.O.D.. so, you can add the automatic gearbox to enter the collection and open A.F. your temporary collection then this is a MIDI-file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then do not include B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>

<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element on individual element. all about the possibilities and limits will be in simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only be found in a document. it may contain the definition of many tickets, but contains only a element, but nothing else.</seg>

<seg id="2019">To review the TagXML files, the tools can start up in the & quantaplus; window to start and overlap TagXMLX. another dialogue is set to follow, its simple instructions is to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the verification is only available at the TagXML files in & quantaplus.</seg>

<seg id="2027">The button button1 can be assigned to the button. using the button, button 1 can be assigned to the button.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The easiest actions. it may be given a text in the detachable settings and will add this text in the document on the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful role of action. with the help of this action, external applications can change or used as input (or parts of the document), you can change examples from & quantaplus; even the Schnellstart dialogue or the various Behold in... promotions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">As first, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myhome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified Pfade is allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptances: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / Scripts from their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced the URL of the current document. in case of a local document it is removed: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; only one instance is running, the text is made to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP to control of & quantaplus, will be used by external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the repositories.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above mentioned methods, a script input from & quantaplus; at the standard settings can be determined. in the selection field, you can send to the standard settings. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected section of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the issue of the completed application can be published. there are two types of issue: normal edition, which is written on the default issue. it can be specified in which the default issue will be specified by using the value of the selection issue:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a tool for each group. in the case there are not too many, therefore one can create a tool with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool is added, you need to add and configurable promotions. select the action plan.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this feeding are quite self-explanatory. press the New Action Knopter at the lower end of the Fensters starts the editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all necessary fields and add it the day for the suitable tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and if the day attribute its use, and you plan to make your use, activate the dialogue "Day," if you are using the promotion to the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is it an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this icon? if we replace difficulties before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbolise that the action is better represented, we will use & kicondo; choose from the & kmen;, graph More (or where else it is located in the distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kicondo; uses 32x32 pixel, we need 22 x22 pixels. to change this, select black.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the symbol symbol not only helps you to remember what the promotion is doing, but also all the other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">In mind that the day start, I decided to create a starting button as the symbol of green (green is usually defined as rigid, rigid, further), or should at least, a message to the users, click here. this symbol will add a & lt; started on day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbols needs to be connected to the action. this happens via the menu with settings (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. in addition to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">If you choose the file, in which the stored symbol is stored, select it and confirm you with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the knob knob and put them with other tags, so there is what are, or confirm you to complete with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantaplus; -functions for a better view, or it should be shared this to better overview through some Trenner in several groups. open the tool bar about the tool bar. make sure the required tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I would like to select the Trenner (very left above) for my tool bar. after selecting the element that will be added to the tool bar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I would like to add a quick opportunity to access the Conqueror preview. I'll choose it and add to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, how the Trenner support the group. someone who doesn't know my tool doesn't know that the & Konqueror; -button on the opposite of the start-button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by using any symbols, to ensure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">You do not exist in the correct folder, but your tool bar should be stored in the right folder, but your tool bar should be loaded in the right file, so that your tool bar will be loaded (n), if a file is open from the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language, which you like to do it. hence, this chapter describes a & PHP; document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository, if someone has done for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to create an existing documentation for the formulas / Skript / etc. then, you have to create the docrc file. the first part we left you, we treat the second.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># 52.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.1.html Division 2 = par-1.html-1 = tagmhtml-2 = daily 2.html-3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation so something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc] = php42 / # top level: Top Level = Introduction = Introduction = Introduction = Introduction = Introduction = Introduction = Basic Reference = basic syntax,... Basic syntax = triage.basic syntax. html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this shows that there's no known border with its own content. there is no known border for the chess teles (except for reason) mdash; but try it even.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents directly on one file's referenced (and consistent, at the upper end of the construction work & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">No spaces do not affect anything, but pay attention & & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resources cendateries will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the range of docrc _ fetch _ array function. for example, when writing a writing tool. there are only two types of entries here. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and file types.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of by using a separate background elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then, in the same file such as docrc, and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure, you will send your docrc files with an description of important information, for example, documentation uses to be used by the & quantaplus; -Repository. you will not be rich, but we are proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; they are not alone anymore. it is possible to divide the Resources (DTEP packages, tool bar with actions, scripts, templates) with other places. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent to friends, partners, or else to whom are sent. in different places, there is an email address, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, tool menu from files and folders in the templates and in the scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be done in our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download and make use it as correct, for which it needs a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origins of the resources will be ensured, both for our team as well as the later user.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When you invite you to the passpase for their private GPG key (the Passphrase is not stored), or in the case you will have to pass a look for you. in the dialogue New Resource must be filled (URL preview, empty), and with click from OK.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The port can download from the menu DTD DTD package (DTEP) to upload, toolbar tool bar, and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading of an resource, even before the installation, the integrity and Significance. in the case of problems, please note the warning messages. if the integrity and the resource has been signed, appears a message with the author of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It's possible to work on XML languages by using a DTEP package. however, the creation can be more complicated because hundreds of day files in dayXML format could be needed. there is a simpler track to convert a DTD to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD store and conversions to a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which should be used. afterwards the following dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Objective name: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep file.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE definitions: the character set which is released! DOCTYPE day, such as HTML PUBLIC / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / alte.dtd should be released.</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if activates, brings & quantaplus; after the conversion of the new & DTEP, you can be adapted to the details of the newly created & DTEP. it is recommended to use this opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there is some key concepts. in order to understand these benefits and full benefit from & quantaplus; this chapter has to place them with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to accommodate these concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; little use brownish.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the work area has divided into three areas: global, locally and projection, this differentiation concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for each, the & quantaplus; it is available in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; it enables the group of administrators in a global tree to secure actions and patterns in a global tree that will then be available in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements provide a personal collection of web development for a single user. these are custom-specific pattern and toolbar. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-based elements are available only within a specific project. this can be used for the files of a specific project. simply, this is the most restricted size. all elements are put in the files of the project, which means common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editors window, the construction site, the Karteireites with info and the tool bar. please turn in, and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can get the card-in with the right mouse button to get a configure menu with the current document, such as the current, other or all card, reload, delete, or return to the document, jump to a read sign or version of CVS commands.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-down menu in the Editorrange, as well as basic handling steps (cut / copy / copy), processing of the tags under the mouse, using the file named or open the file, if the character is named after the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the upper end of the editors of the editors are currently working & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of tool bar will be shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus; they are adapted to the new features and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool palette is really easy. if you want to add a single day, then click the symbol which you want to enter the day. if you want a day to add several attributes (such as anchor), you can fill up several fields you can fill up several fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The Baumants (QIT;) allow to navigate in information on & quantaplus; to navigate it, to open and go through. in the presentation with carteireites stand for files, project, pattern plants, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation construction.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool designed to provide & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows the files to be carried out in the project with correct mouse click. promotions such as hints, removing, removing, or deleting the files from the storage medium can be carried out using the context menu menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a model: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on it, in which context it can be used. global templates are always available, local templates only for the corresponding users and templates in projects are only used in the project. more information is available in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripts. the concept of structure in Global, Lokal and Project works here. on the left mouse button, you can find the information on a script. further functions are available, such as the script is to start, edit, edit or email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view is showing the internal structure of the active document. through the links section of an element, the cursor is set on the position of the element. by right-up of an element, a list of commands in relation to navigation and collecting of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other construction views. with him, manoeuvinged attributes and naming areas, which allows for the contents of all available attributes with a few mouse click on the contents.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of Web-technology for your development. we can download the documentation for & quantaplus; 'Document of the documentation, you can create own documentation, and adding a Regulatory doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be edited, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two antitrust in the lower end of the Fensters, about the easy-to-use information can be reached: the news window and the problem is window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This box is more information about each in Quanta running Skript. such as the used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cartons show all error in the market-up of the current document. & quantaplus; -scripting, which will be carried out, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; workmanship are extensive and easy to understand. they appear on a symbol and they get the appropriate command. the chocolate site of the tool is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus; to define.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool with e-mail. & quantaplus; if they get a tool bar in an e-mail, you can buy this in & quantaplus; like any other secure and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adapt the site of the & quantaplus; -files on your system. to get a complete list of options that give the configure script. to get a complete list of options to understand. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand, and here are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems at Starten of & quantaplus; you should check if your path contains the & KDE; 3 program folder, you should make sure that no older version of & KDE; 3 in PATH before their bin file is. the same applies to & Qt.</seg>

<seg id="2199">Observes, everything is not available. it can be any file with text, so images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; can be inserted in documents by linking (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / URL). some examples are available in advance with global templates. additional information on the templates are available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from each text document. normally, we can specify a basic documents in appropriate subfolders to be efficient. some examples can be found in appropriate ways to be efficient. some examples can be found among global templates. see also for more information on the templates.</seg>

<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on file. alternatively, you can save the selection as local / projectors. alternatively, the selection can be easily drawn with finish and lay on the construction sites.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binders is simple: the file is simply copy in a prevalent file. you can use all file management functions for it, such as gypsum and deposits, or add about the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can check in the file tree or in the project files for a file on a folder, and site template create a name for the model and secure. by default, the project is secured, but of course it can be saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project pre-related templates. you can shape the headlines, or dynamically with & PHP; design, files or with them. in addition, some things can retain some of them in the eye at a very deep-depth at the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The prevalence structure on the ground window is based on the $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / Templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / template. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as seen above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">In order to specify the behavior of a file, in the prepress overview with the right mouse button on the folders and choose to choose in the context menu properties. the following dialogue appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A select field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is abducted, as soon as possible Attribute to the attributes.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is activated by default, and it would be checked out in this path, it would be checked out in this path, except they would be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with anything like the text building. if nothing appears, you will probably be in a trunk file.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The previous text allows for pre-specific headlines for a specific project, enabling headlines for a particular project, enabling headlines in a file with special headlines / footlines an entire presentation already with the matching headlines / footlines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, we are using the context menu (which, right mouth button press) on a complete command collection for the execution of folders or copy, and add the templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source text editor, which allows the source code text by VPL; -Editor and second item the editors window in two parts: the source code editor and VPL; -editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: he invites the document such as a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor position. then, you can download and refer to the source code editor, which carried out changes in the VPL; editor in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -Editor on a document; it's not possible to edit these directly with the VPL; -editor. to edit & PHP; it is not necessary to edit the source text editor. there is no plans to change these behaviors.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode does not work in the source code editor as well as the VPL; -Editor synchronous mode. with pressures from F9, this mode is activated, the button on the active cursor of a window into the control, whereby the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; -editor and source code editor, can be set between synchronisation after one click or automatically choose between synchronisation. basically, the recommendation can be set. basically, the Recommendation: a small barter for fast computers and a big donation for slow development.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, meaning the document of unvisible tags in the working with the VPL; editor is also called, as soon as a new document with the VPL; -Editor is created. this allows you to change the reduction of the Nordic Col. so you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags, storing information on the document itself, e.g. stroke on internet search engines. meta elements can be added to the list of content, e.g. keywords on the column and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to add pages in the browser. you can add CSS rules on the list or delete the screen. a change of the list is exactly like the meta elements. the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It's possible to connect an external CSS style by using the file-button, and select the appropriate file again.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursors is like in a text processing, due to berries. under rare circumstances, the cursor invests itself. the marking works as usual. text may be inserted by inserts and attached to a button or distance button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The entries of the tags will be done in the same manner, as in the source text editor. it's to note that there will not be an existing tags, i.e., when a anchor-day, surround with text, each other surrounding anchor is removed.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools for the same. why is why & kdiff3;? let me explain how I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merging was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes made at the same time. another programmers had changed much text in the same file. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result were a lot of conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2283">I used this program to me, but I did not see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there were no evidence to the places where maybe only the changes had changed. these changes had changed to a small Albarian.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could show differences within a row and changes in white signs. later, a lot of more useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare the text, simply copy it into the clipboard, and add him in one of the reference window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made much work was the same and merging by folders. these function related & kdiff3; almost in a complete file-browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">It is useful if two people are independent by one piece of changes and changes. the original file (the basis) helps users to do with correct changes. in this editor, you can even edit the result. the screen photo shows three quell files at the connections.</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you at the same and merging complete files. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; in the folders:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; the exact differences can be found and catered to the possibilities of their real colour monitors. if you need frequently, you'll need to check this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabators are visible. when lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see at a look at the summary of the column in the column on the left-hand side. (no trouble more if somebody changes to changes.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If one file is equal, and the other is differs in a row, then the color is shown, which file is different. red color means that both files are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same names, but in different folders, you can facilitate the tipparable work by using only the filenames of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">3, 2, 3 files, 3 folders, 3 files, 3 folders, 3 folders, 3 files</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialogue allows you to select the manual page by file name, the selection of the file-browser. if you don't need to specify a third file again; if you don't have to specify the third file, if you have the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences are carried out with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">If you choose a folder, select the files and merging files. if you choose a file, if a file is chosen, for B and C, a file, then use & kdiff3; the file name from A into the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is crossed, the input field is to be actively involved, and it is not necessarily necessary to specify a file-file. you can also do this step later with the memory.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The file button opens up a dialogue with settings. here you can specify options before you start with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text box. compared to this comparison, you will then select any files. in the opening stage, you don't have to select the dialog, you can simply connect the dialogue with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use Zither and Abdication: simply take a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let him fall over a reference window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">This thought is behind it? sometimes it contains a file, such as they would like to create such a relatively large amount. you would need to download two corresponding files, they would like to copy it into & kdiff3; and then, you can simply copy all relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at the moment you can't go out of & kdiff3; only the thread of the text is supported in a reference window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpreting the brick and place of text into another program than cut and add (instead of copying or add). in such case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text box, the Info line contains a different color. (note that window is optional). (note that the window is optional). (note that the mouse is optional). (note that the mouse is optional) for a while, you can rest a while on the line. then, a small relief window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these default settings can be changed over the settings).</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, one can distinguish themselves, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings) is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is seen in the next section (merging) good.</seg>
<seg id="2306">In addition to the text, the column is indicated. in some programming languages where white characters will not be useful to see the relevant changes. (at C / C + + for example, white characters only are in character and commentaries, for preprocessor and in few, rare single cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which determines the summary column from the text, where the number source file is interrupted. if the line is activated, the line is activated, the line will be displayed on the broken rows.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparative windows) also has a info line with inscription copy:, the filenames and [Gechanges] when you have processed the result. usually it contains automatic processes already, but often contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! - all conflicts is dissolved, the memory is deactivated!!!! (use the buttons Springe at nächstem / ungelösten conflict around the remaining remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative windows, each difference is used at the same time a conflict of the manual must be solved at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking on the left mouse button in one of the window is displayed in the windows, where the group is displayed in windows, where the group will not be visible.) This group will become the current group of background colour for current area and to the left a black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, there is no more line in the group. then, in these lines of the text, you will change your mind and perhaps again a other source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marking, you might have to copy it and weighed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & be set; however, in the clipboard, however, appear in the clipboard, if you want to copy such text from the result window. go wrong with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if you select the options to ignore the options are ignoring or Ignoriere C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This will navigate to the screens and the mouse, but you can also use the arrow. if you use in a window, you can also use the arrow guides you to other programs, as well as you can use it from other programs. you can also use the vertical column next to the vertical screens.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other keys to edit. using the insert button, you can change between insertion and transmitting mode. (preset is set-in mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group (as already in the section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The workmanship contains seven buttons to the current / previous difference (Ctrl-down to Strong-above), or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrg-picture above / Strong-above), even after the manual dissolve as a conflict. therefore, it must be distinguished between the solves and unquestionable conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the mark into the clipboard, you have to copy the copy of the button. if it is activated, whatever you must mark the clipboard and the manual head. be careful with this option, because you might write the contents of the clipboard may be mistakenly deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeiling is stored in accordance with the groundbreaking system\\ r\. KDiff3 keeps the copy of the source code files, you should not use the source code files, you should use & kdiff3; even with binofiles.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the most recently used files are stored automatically and restored with the next start. (menu adjustment - &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a writing with a solid width. (in some systems the dialogue also provides information with variable width to choose from, you should not use this.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate these option, differences are shown in curative scriptures. if the chosen scripture doesn't support this representation, nothing happened.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colours could not be displayed in their pure form. but at these systems, the button is automatically an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is activated, the respective of the tabulator button will be added to the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tabulator is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or Return, the final row will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is activated, any selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. manual copy into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which Zeille type, you prefer to use it. the pre-set value is the general selection to the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">At the same step, you tried to find white characters 3; first, all of all identical lines are ignored. in this step, the second step is ignored every row. in this step, the white signs are ignored. also in this step, the white signs are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) you can look at the end of a row, but then files with different sizes are available; however, if this option is enabled, you will have a white signs, but as a white sign will be disabled. however, this option must be deactivated. in the default setting this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default setting this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and related characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. however, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In the default setting this option is deactivated. changes in commentary are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intense after smaller differences are looking for smaller. the option is activated in the default setting. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Automated-pass mode, this setting defines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next ungosts continued conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solves automatic conflicts in white signs by the chosen file as a source. (preset is manual). if you are not only available from time, then use the automatic selection of conflicts in numbers or comments, if the options are ignoring or Ignoriere C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options will be treated in Chapter for scanning of folders and conduct a merging. look for details under the documentation for the directory comparison and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already exists an older version, then the original version used the Suffix .original file, when such a backupfile with the Suffix .original exists, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts the language of the user's user. you must end & kdiff3; finish and restart the change is active. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language will be set there over the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be adjusted for every entry separately. if you activate these option, you will be used for all the top setting.</seg>
<seg id="2340">About the selection fields for the coding appears a short note which the local code is. (this can not be modified here and has an informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Fit the file for source code to source code. this affects such as special characters and interpreters. because the encoding for each file can be adjusted individually, can be compared to files with different cosican.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have a file, you can designate here, which should be used, encoding the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you want to define pre-processing, you could not work with your codec. (for example, your files are 16-bit Unicode, but the device command can only use only 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can designate the coding of pre-processing output.</seg>
<seg id="2344">To switch this, in order to suppress highlighting changes in white characters in text or suggestions. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring or Ignoriere C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is available only if you have three files. in normal mode, you can see the differences between two or three files. if you are looking for A & lt; B, A & lt; C or B & B; C or B & B is provided. in addition to the normal still a second overlay column with the necessary information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available room on your screen for long lines. Blend you simply use the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arranges the comparison of other lines as well as each other. this can also be useful to advertisements of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you can see the differences and select the files. a simple click starts to take the file and uses the filenames of the last source file as a preset name for the file's file. (if this function is used to restart the merging again, then the name of the last used file is retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will be given first to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the issue of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor, which is precisely your needs. for example, this function can be cut-out parts or the correct this function.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will be given to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the issue of the command is used. you can write your own preprocessor, which meets exactly your needs. each input line must have an additional issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind it is that users can allow more flexibility when developing the diff results. but most users would not need a external program, and most users would like to program this message. however, the good news is however, that in most cases, or perl totally out.</seg>

<seg id="2354">While you experimenting with experimenting, you might understand it and perhaps you like this regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The Ignite of numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as example for a further pre-processing command for Zeille. read it / [0123456789.-] / / g 'each of the signs between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each Treffer will be replaced by nothing, so many could be deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you want to perform several settings on once. then, you can use the semicolon ';' we use the creation of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead, you can also use some other details like perl. perl -p -p's / REGEXP / Erg / SCHALTER's / REGEXP / replacement\\ (\\) needs only a few details. where\\\ 'required\\' needs only (and) without the previous year's\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data is retained according to normal preprocessor, and maintain. other operations are set only the data that can be used to use the ignition equal to Algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal preprocessor, the processor-preprocessor-preprocessor the output of normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful but as with each function, the text changes or differences hidden, you may accidentally't notice certain differences and in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">You often have to edit programmer in a file so many files. for this reason, you can compare with & kdiff3; complete file-recursively and summarized.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... does it take a suggestion for any object; you can adjust the suggestion before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate simulate and shows the simulated changes, without they really do,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected action either with all (F7-key) or only with selected objects (F6 button),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the same and merging of individual files. you need to open only folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are related, the file is used as a base. if no goal is specified, it uses & kdiff3; files are specified as a target file.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of files automatically starts, not the merging. to start the link, you need to select the appropriate menu entry or the F7 key. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While the folder informs you a small news window over the current progress. if you break the scanning of the file, only the files are listed, which were compared to then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scanning of the file is complete, & kdiff3; a list of windows with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folders during the scan was shown here in a tree. you can choose a object with a simple mouse click here.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The files is usually assembled in a folder, by clicking the + / - click on the object double or by adding the arrow keys to the left / right. the menu menu includes two functions of subdirectories, and all subdirectories - that allows you to cover all folders and check out.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you click on a double click, the file comparison will start and it appears as a reference window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the date type in the first file (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type in the other files is differently, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane. in such case the concise watch can not be selected automatically. if the merging start is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As in the above picture, in the columns A / B / C the colours red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">However, in identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries are different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Files are identical as the same as its whole content is identical. then, file also have the same color. when files, the age is unsignificantly intended for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea to this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colours reflects the colours of a leaflet, then yellow will then be yellow and later when it is old, red is red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy from C (or if C not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not a: copy of A (or if it doesn't exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C not the same date type (e.g. A a file and B one file is): mistake: conflicting data types. as long as such are faulty objects exist, the merging are not started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B did not have the same date type (e.g. A file and B file is a file): mistake: conflicting data types. as long as such are faulty objects exist, the merging are not started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">Mode for synchronisation is active when only two folders and no explicitly stated target file, and if the option is synchronize with the option. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action out, so they are identical to both folders.</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merging and the result in both folders. (the user look at the visible file name only B; directly after the conforming & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are required, the date of the files and the newer file is required. however, the files are different, but the same date will have an error message: files are different, but the date is identical.. solves such mistakes can't be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="2387">As a result, a file is looking away, if the merging is successful after the merging it was successful, and according to other messages, if the merge is completed, you should see a last review, and see if the status is everywhere in order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog, the file comparative method is selected, KDiff3 will show more columns. these contain the number of vertebrates, dissolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for dissolved conflicts only appear if three folders compared to or together.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either lead either the selected entry (file or Odner) either, or all entries in once. if you have chosen any additional watch actions (even in all subfolders) you can start.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you don't have any target file, then in the Three-file-merge C is used as the goal of using a two-file merge, B is used as the target and in the synchronization, A and / or B is used as a goal.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have a target file, please verify that all entries should be displayed in the target file, even in the folders. there are some options by certain entries can be overclock. check these options for uncompromising surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To meet all the entries: choose the directory start / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the key / button) to take advantage of the current element: choose promotion of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If caused by conflicting data types always, a message appears to exist on the faulty elements. you can choose to select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you perform all entries, an analog window with the options have to simulate, simulate and break.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Then, if you want to see what you would like to see what really the changes are made, you will get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then, certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is necessary (together a single file), then a merging window (please note the screen photo).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you're done with a file, select the directory-assembled directory start / continue or press F7. if you are still not stored, a corresponding dialogue is continued. then & kdiff3 will continue his work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">When & B diff3, you will see a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you can try to take the cause of the problem. so you have the possibility to select another action on the entry or to solve the problem to any other way, before you continue to continue with the connections.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been put together, it must not count all the entries in the recent session, but if here the merging are not stored, or not stored, these entries are considered to be done. only if you change the connections, these entries are again assembled.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The menu menu of & kdiff3; (menu settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory-merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that are displayed in the elemental area. it can be given a pattern with a semicolon;. valid space holder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. file must not correspond to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders are indicated by this pattern, you can't use the semicolon; as a partition: '*' and '?'. default: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders are indicated by this pattern, you can't use the semicolon; as a partition: '*' and '?'. default: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are ignored by CVS. many autmatic files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this files are specific with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files are hidden in some filesystem. in other filystation, one file is hidden. this option lets you decide whether this files are indicated in the element tree or not. this option is switched on in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When links to files: if the option is outdated, symbolic link is compared. if the option is switched on, the files are compared to the links. this is activated in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2407">In case of links to files: if the option is set off, the links are displayed and recursively. (note that & the option is switched on a file for yourself and & kdiff3; shortened.) This option is outdated in the default position.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs an complete analysis of each file and shows the statistics columns. (the number of soldered, unicals, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when they are used on files that do not contain a text. (give an appropriate one of the anti-patterns.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare great file on a slowdown network, it might be faster, just the change date and the file size. however, this speed limit is due to safety. please use it with caution. this option is in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the change of change, there is no real comparison. these files are as identical if they have gone up equal. however, this option is going to be worn out. please note with caution. this option is in the default setting.</seg>

<seg id="2412">If there is differences, the copy of the newer file is proposed as a action. (this is considered uncertain, because it is not altered that the other file is not changed. you should check this in any case.) This option is outdated in the default position.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file is replaced by a file, or deleted, the original version was renamed. if an old backup file is removed with the .original file, this does not require further backup. this option does not only implement the appropriate file. this option is switched on the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Usually, the file-lead-view dates back to the conform of single files. if you don't want to change the window with the mouse buttons. if you don't want to switch the option directory & text windows, the window on the window and text windows can be changed between the two views on the window.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulated one mouse click on the same place. it is thought to help people who suffer any mouse click in any mouse (RSI), and each of which any mouse click in pain. however, it requires a bit of exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; may cause pain, who is being able to use the mouse without pain. unfortunately, you may need to carry out pain when using the computer of your computer, you should check out a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In order to avoid it clear: even if & kmousetool; pain helps to use pain, that is caused by pain that is caused by the mouse being caused by the mouse being used, and as with all ergonomic aid agents, the result can fall in each case.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitored your mouse movement and enter a mouse click, once you break the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is intelligent insert, turns & kmousal pool; a break after the end of the movement is carried out by the end of the movement, and you can run the mouse button. this way you can easily rebuild a bit of exercise but you want to get spoiled quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This compares must be enough after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; a mouse click runs.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If it is ready to go on, the turning point is ready (1 / 10 s). here, the time is set to get & kmousetool; after downloading the mouse button, before it returns the mouse button if the mouse is not done because of the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can move the sound time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go on sound & Multimedia, choose sound system and here the riders General, where you can adjust the sound system, where you can set a lower value to reduce the response time.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, & kmousetool; at each start of & KDE; it is currently available only under & KDE. in GNOME or other window environments please take the specific documentation to figure out how to start there a program.</seg>
<seg id="2508">All the settings are back to the opening of the dialogs. have already set the button on the button, the settings are placed on the stand according to the last pressures of the application.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The best you use & kmousetool; first of all, you should run at first. in particular, you should check out the automatic mouse click you will then take you to the automatic mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you want to use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response rates of & KDE, with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should aware, in which places a mouse click without effect stays: the clicks on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window, which does not respond to unused reactions. you can therefore use the mouse in such places, until you want to use them back.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse buttons, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is easy, that you don't want to clean the mouse, but also the roles that enter the mouse balls.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to take the mouse balls, as it is done by mouse to mouse. but it should be clear but if you need to view the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have the ball, you would have to see the ball. these are in the sides of the hole, in which the ball has been used. the trick and the pollution can easily be easily connected with a flat blade or the finger nails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system has started the design of & kmousetool; if you do not use the intelligent switch, this means that & kmousetool will not end the operation and the operation can't end up by the sloping button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; using a different window manager, use a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you have a mouse click. as a result, the status of & kmousetool will come back and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter the text, trying to run & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: do not use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you don't want to have a button on a neutral area. safe zones for mouse buttons are unfolded. safe zones for mouse buttons and menus and the cover lines in windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart locking, but I don't want to edit the text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">It's an intelligent function of & kmousetool; and it needs to take it back to mark the clipboard, if you want to move into the mouse button, but if you want to move the mouse when they move the mouse button, but there will probably be a few problems here. here are some counselections:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent loading, if you only use a mouse click here. mark the text instead of a mouse click in the end of the text area. if you move the mouse button, while you move the mouse button on the other end of the text and move again the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">It is possible for every time when & kmousetool; the mouse button is played with a sound like a mouse click. later, you can use the intelligent loading and play without the audible mouse click. but it also needs a few exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool, you must be installed, the Xtest extension for & X Window, must be installed on most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers.</seg>

<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text-orders. each order you encounter each of the card orders, is a textbook. KSayit is an example of an application that uses the text orders. text orders are intended for the issue of an issue, which does not need any special drumming.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order cards are marked in waiting-long, with the exception of the Screen Readers. if an application has the issue of a screen Readers, while & ktts; just like such an application, this issue will hold and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">At first, you have to know that filter has never been applied to the issue of screen Readern. you will be applied on normal warfare, messages and text orders, as well as & KDE; -news.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter process the text and give him to the next filter. at the moment there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filter are executed as modules. in the future it can still be more types of filters.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; that allows the administration to network interfaces, the routine and the DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows users to manage a range of system and desktopsettings via a single, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by K Menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf file system was developed to provide users the administration of TCP / IP network settings in the same way, such as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; create for the users a simple interface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installing a new module network settings in & kcontrolcenter; displayed. network settings (knetworkconf;) can be launched through a selection of kcontrolcenter; Internet and network networking settings in & kscreen.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware doesn't install them. physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured, so that & knetworkings; the device shows all the device and setting the network characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2803">Most cases will be added for the network hardware and other devices with the installer / Linux; installed and equipped. network appliances will later added, the drivers will need to be loaded by adapting to the following files, according to the core version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module settings is loaded, if the option is selected using network settings in & kcontrolcenter; index index is selected. when using the module's network settings, this platform is trying to detect the platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform is not recognized, the platform is offered. it is the platform to select the distribution and reease. because of the setting up non-once again, the platform can be set permanently. while the next start of network settings will then be set automatically, this selection will be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">The change of network settings are available only in system management mode. before, all options are gray, meaning that settings can only be viewed. in the system management mode, you will click on the right lower end of the module mode. it's the input of the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The Reiter Network interfaces serves to manage the network appliances of the system. all available network appliances are displayed. from the riders network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings can be realized through a selection of the desired device in the list and click the button of the button, set up in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. ankle the Knopes Advanced settings shows the dialogue with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The TCP / IP settings are specified for the system at the same time with the start of system services. the DHCP or BOOTP servers will be required for any system start. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP, can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">The TCP / IP configuration can be performed on the TCP / IP configuration. in the input box IP address the desired TCP / IP address should be specified. in the input box network mask is the subnet mask.</seg>

<seg id="2815">It should be sure that the IP address in the network will not be used for a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the console, you can find whether the desired address is already used in use. in doubt the network should be asked to the network administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network appliances can be activated, depending on demand, or switched off. ready-to-out network device is carried out by a selection of the list and click on interface.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network appliances can be activated, depending on demand, or switched off. a activating network device takes place through a selection of the list and click on interface.</seg>

<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworking.sourceforge.net, you can download the latest version of the source material.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binders distribution (usually rpm packages) it is sufficient when & KDE and Qt is installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced user. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm like this follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphic surface such as cold or the installation tool of your distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & KDE is sufficient, but in addition, development planning with libraries and others needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only experienced users for users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; to compile it. the following commands should make this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on fundamental network technology, in the second section are acquitted all of & knetworkconf; change configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace further knowledge via IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration into a small (home) network is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv4 has never been found. of IPv6, it is expected to keep in the near future. this description focuses on the spread of IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to assign IP address to network interface. in foreign networking sites, the network is the contact location which can be valid for a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can't be used any case any case, the IP address can not be easily elected!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When creating a own small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen from one especially for this purpose, to avoid IP address with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not redirected at the Internet, so its use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, the access can be enabled to the Internet for such machines by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are used in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is used for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the net mask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so all computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things are 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route that requires the loopback address (localhost = the own computer). the standard route will be required for the IP transmission.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The power address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine. normally the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files, which are affected by & knetworkconf; they are affected and where they are in the different districts.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is dynamically changed for DSL connections, so it's not surprised if in the case of active DSL connections to find another content as specified in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; it has the possibility to create several archives on a band. moreover, the first thing was to create a surface for tar to create a question. the second goal was to question a question that my wife introduced to my wife: how much longer takes it, if you are driving?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be operated by & kdat; that can happen in three types:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; spult the band, and reads the special information of the Bandes. recognises & kdat; the act on the tape will not be asked if the band will be format.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the prespear, looking for the matching index on your plate. may not be found, you will be asked if the band index will be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went out, the symbol changes the tape drive to indicate that the band is integrated. in the status of the status, the volume of the band can now be looking for the volume sign for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before the out of the banana, first, all the integration must be solved. there are three methods to apply this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; a change of symbols for the band has been solved that the band has been solved for the band and shows a corresponding news release. the band can now be discarded without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat; can be used, it must be used by & kdat; format.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band must be formatted before you can't use the format. this process does not happen before you use the band of & kdat; if you want to use the band of & kdat; usually, floppy drives are usually using a formatting of the band, the DAT drives cannot be used.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band, and the capacity drives & kdat; with the format of the band. all data on the band is lost! after completion of the formatting process, the band will automatically be integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup procedure, you must select the safest files, which can happen to three types:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or a file in the local file tree. it is backed only this file or file-file.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a profile profile in the tree. it is backed by the profile specified in the profile.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Mark your files in the local file tree with a hooks. only the so striking files and / or subfolders are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu of Shechem...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was launched, the dialog elements for backup. in this dialogue, you can check the selected files and modify the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you confirm the settings, the dialog, the dialogue shows the progress of the securing data, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Mark a file or file in one of the archives in the file for the drive. it only uses the selected file or file files.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the archives in the archives for the band with a hooks. it will only tested the selected files and / or subfolders.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry for testing....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure started, the dialogue applies for review. in this dialogue you can check even your selection and support for the review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the review, the dialogue appears to review. this dialogue shows the progress of the exam and the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can connect the files, the files must be restored, marked by two types:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or a file in one of the archives created for the tape drives. it is restored only the selected file or the subordination.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Mark the desired files from one of the archives with a hooks. it will only be restored with the so selected files and / or subfolders.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Click with the right mouse button to a file or a file in a archives and select in the menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restoration process started, the dialog for recovery. in this dialogue you can check even your selection and recovery to recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for recovery, the dialog, the dialogue shows the progress of the recovery and the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to create the band indexed. on this process, all existing index files for this band. you can create the index to two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">As a result, a profile profile with the just marked files and the default settings. you can use the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work, in which securing the backup should be done. the list of the safest files are automatically updated according to the appropriate work file.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders, which are listed under the backup files that are stored on the same file system, such as the file. folders such as a file that can be found on other filesystem. each entry is taken from tar independently from the other.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an inmental backup of backup. to determine which files have been changed since the last inmental backup, a snap file is used. it only secured the files that have been changed since.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to ensure changes since the last inmental retardant has been used.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Calculated the snapshots file before the call of tar. this causes that all files are backed up and a new snapshots file for the next backup is laid out.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons & gt; gt; and lt; then, files was not fully implemented entirely at the time of the preparation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be installed via the menu item KDat... in the menu settings, the following settings can be:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file system for the tape drives (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rety version of the tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the band is involved, the command load will be connected to the drive. some running units is this necessary, before read or write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, tried & kdat; the yield of the tape drives. possibly, this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, when using the integration of & kdat, the band is done automatically. use this option in Floppy-Streamern.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, tried & kdat; the hardware blocking size is required for the tape drive. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you must be able to use & kdat; in any case the blocksize is to be able for your bandage.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band format, it writes a file at the beginning of the band. this file should only be given a memory block on the band. the contents of the file is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The band-ID. this drawing is the complete name of the system, where the band was formatted. seconds, the number of seconds, which have been passed since the era have passed, in which the band was format.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $HOME / .kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar -archives that can administer directly with & GNU; - tar manage. even other tar-versions should work as long as it is not inmental scents.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the content of a safety binding. this symbol is only active when a band is included.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystem log, you can't know where you can't know information about your system, or where the system can be stored on your system, or where the system allows users to access the different protocol files. in addition, & ksystem log has experienced users quick access for example on information about problems that will occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users to understand your computers in the background. it's a simplified presentation of the protocol files in your own system. the program is suitable for unexperienced users, don't know where you can get information about your system, or where the system is stored on different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystem log has experienced users for quick access to the example of information about problems that will be appearing on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, some extended functions can be filtered by using the protocol files (filtered) files.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog; a range of useful functions. among other things, among others:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of protocol files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included in the other chapters of this hand.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Like you see in the following screen photo shows, & ksystemlog; functions are available, with its help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file is easily filters and sorted. the individual possibilities for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this hand.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, it tries to open and open this system protocol, and it will not be open to system log messages. the protocol files are usually found in the file / var / log file, for the normal users usually do not have a permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter system to filtered according to the chosen filters. in the standard setting, you can only find a protocol which is displayed in the standard filter. then, a protocol line will only appear if in one of the columns the character set off the filter system.</seg>
<seg id="2949">Of course, you can choose one another entry in this point. select the column of the filter process, and you will also select the filencode of a process that shows you & ksystemlog; all the protocol lines are sent to which this process was broadcast or created.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the standard setting, and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level bug are displayed with a eye-catching color as a protocol lines. the colored illustration of protocol lines can be outdated.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to use only certain process (for example in system protocol or in the Cron protocol), so you can be useful if you want to investigate the issue of a certain command, such as the start of the Samba server. in this case you can use filter options.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump the option to view new lines jump in the context menu of the main event, to allow all new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to use multiple protocol files in a separate windows. to open this function, use the entries in the window to open up additional subwindow and manage to manage. once you have selected a window, select a protocol for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has a own website on http: / / ksystem log.forum-software.org. Dort you can find more current information about the reference sources of & ksystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you also find in the following file of the & KDE; -Subversion Archivs: csystem log; in & KDE; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & KDE, System V of the Editor, rather known (and in the following also called) as & ksysv; this section goes into a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V apt system develops fast to the standard for control of the program starts at the high-speed system in the & Linux; so it is why it easier to use more powerful, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD columns.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know anything else: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The loaf binary file is therefore important because maybe someone could try to take a machine on the V of the wheel, without a new installation and new formatting file. that's why you need to be sure that the old apt is removed from there, if there was there.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV lineages also differs from the BSD, that the configuration files in a subfolders of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this file is rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, system services include such things like network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such stuff like setbacks that will only start once again. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be on the one hand under / etc / rc.d if you're not able to use this file, even if you want to run a rc.js in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something to do with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Kernel is looking for various places after the program init and starts the first one that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard run-level is in / etc / inittab. you should see in the starting area as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can look at a look into the second column and you can change it / etc / inittab of hand and change the 3 change. if you are looking forward a bit, then you will repair your system by setting the system new and restart the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do you start all the right scriptions? if you enter into rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this file. instead, each entry is here on one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stops init actually System services? quite simple: each of the scripting is that it accepts a argument like boot and stop. you can actually start this script by hand on the command line in the following manner:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would be the httpd server. it reads the name, and if that is an K, the script will be called by the argument. when it includes an S, the script will be called by the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to install a simple way to use machines for many purposes. I could run it on httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc; running up. furthermore, I could even have a user-service level, which will start & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be difficult to be difficult because the program is so user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another time mobile device is simple to say to say trivial: pull out an entry of your sharing system services to one of the six run level to start him on this level (or stop stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also modify the script also between Runleveln or change the position within one levels by changing them. this is done by its original run-level (or its position). this happens not only if they pull out an entry of your initial system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are shifted to copy it into a new area. to copy it only to a new service level, you must choose any copy of the menu or from the context menu and in the target range -- even if the same entry was already in the target range of action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The Sortir number of a entry can sometimes be calculated. in such a case you must edit the sorting parts of the surrounding entries before you can try to include the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present, there is no possibility to restore entries that were cast into the paper basket. let's be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the table-button to enable the different areas of work (sharing system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to meet a selection.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To postpone entry into another run-level, take him into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired Runlevel with inserts (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorrow, or modify the name of a entry manually, press the input button to change between different fields. do not use the dialogue through erect of the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to get the changes to the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Due to the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file is a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. if they are stored by & ksysv. otherwise they will be restored from & ksysv. they are stored in a local sysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I used the standard Runleveln with the standard runn, and now starts the machine-resistant. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard run-level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be usually in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under the run-level X, but they will not be executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) you will need to be able to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The species, such as system services are started in these distributions, is simplified the configuration of proprietary entries in this district, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using any other distribution, please check whether all the configuration files are available, and if they are in the right directory. some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just stop without news, if their configuration files are not present or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be used from version to version different. if you use another distribution, please send us information about the running level, so that this manual may be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you have to store this. either use the corresponding symbol of the tool bar or entry to the menu in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser is a simple application. the main window is made up of two cartons, user's user interface list. you can select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears to be the dialog and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are shown only if you have extended system settings. only if you can install any system settings (Quota) for user interface. additional maps will appear, if Shadow -passwords or e.g. / etc / Master .passwd can be installed in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card card's card appears, if Shadow -passwords, e.g. / etc / master.passwd like in BSD - Unixes are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card will only be activated if required for at least one-page file system limits (Quota). the file system can be changed on the file system. here you can change each user on each user, with the limits on data in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set for each file system individually. the current file system is chosen with the help of the file system with space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card groups informs about the group of the selected wearer. the standard group, which is part of the user, you will find in the field primary Group. furthermore, the user can become a member of other groups, by setting this in large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog features include a list of all users. to add a user to add a user to add this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, you add to add a group or a group or click on the matching execution of the tool bar. edit or use of the selected users or the selected group.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can add the LILO-BootManager, which can change it and change times up to the boats of the standard operating system, remove the default operating system, remove systems, change systems and change more.</seg>
