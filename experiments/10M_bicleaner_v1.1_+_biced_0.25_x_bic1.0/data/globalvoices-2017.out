although I visited the U.S. since 2012 at least once a year , I would now living there for the first time .
and that was very exciting .
my dear to America is highly great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American films , I made American authors read and his sport .
in fact , this country had a very profound impact effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the grand D@@ enz@@ el Washington , a terrible re@@ porter that covered with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura @-@ student , who covered the top military tribunal of judges who had to occupy its interest .
I was caught .
free to Method Man , &quot; I was , when the absolute truth is , lack@@ iss everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year , which I lived in Arizona , had only strengthened my help to the United States .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country , where I lived there , whose diversity is so welcoming , that you can always be that you &apos;re , and it &apos;s easy acceptance of a community of gender people .
I even had a very good love story about its size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the bre@@ asts and Rac@@ ism this man .
the exceptional aspect of its asc@@ ension is for me , as he goes with his bott@@ len@@ ght in his face .
it keeps with his mind never behind the mountain , as you say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he think , as a former colleague wanted to express his death for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ American and women .
nevertheless , people have re@@ acted on his statements and shot himself in Sch@@ ar for him .
the 13 million votes that he won at the Republican con@@ gres@@ sional elections , the highest number ever won by the party of the nom@@ inees .
I was speaking in English .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte person , I asked me ?
I was able to jump and his vot@@ ers do not bring with the people in keeping that I had learned during my time in Phoenix .
as of example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist of journ@@ alism , people from all over the world , is a deep gl@@ ass@@ ment of man , with whom I was able to keep in Islam and his past .
also , Tr@@ um@@ ps met the Welt@@ anschau@@ ung with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present publisher of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met us at our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to play the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; in the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps intoler@@ ance is also on the contrast to the gener@@ osity that I am at Sandy B@@ ahr , who fights for her life on the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as their son .
even she fits to the dedication of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with patience and wor@@ m@@ ingly , and my colleagues helped us to per@@ am@@ per@@ ate to the complexity of American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me much in my career .
these people , and the help of they em@@ bodied values in America .
while lac@@ ed his way to the nom@@ inees of republi@@ can candidate , they offered myself a stop and the counterpart of its limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the Presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his dis@@ regard against non @-@ white people .
the dispute with the idea that humans have failed because they distributed either his rac@@ ism and fan@@ atism , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , I broke almost the heart .
perhaps it &apos;s possible to design@@ ate the tr@@ ump @-@ vot@@ ers as ra@@ assi@@ sts .
in one of my friends , one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and resp@@ ectable and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who want to act on a different kind of manner and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the h@@ ec@@ tic changes will not be taken into account in their communities .
could it be that this vot@@ ers could have , of which most white are , for tr@@ ump , because she would like to win over a country because she dis@@ appointed over a country ?
in other words , they wanted to say they say that they are still important in this United States ?
perhaps .
however , one can &apos;t forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man , who looks back on those who look after those who look differently .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( c . ) : as much as &quot; The White Ag@@ ainst any other Eth@@ ics &quot; ; vocabulary of white in recording on the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as it was called the great Van Jones , exactly the killed what the America did so great .
millions of people around the world will appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - any faith or background you may have so much , America is to welcome you .
for this country has chosen as his President , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers , whose history as he says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with multiple , religious freedom and all the term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the America after 9 / 11 the white man will be back on the ruin that they say .
at all , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a client for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the human quantity .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ent , my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the amount answered with a loud @-@ strong &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; were Muslims in place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; hat@@ ches the amount .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answered them .
have Af@@ ro @-@ Americans a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they had called them and their voices were no@@ isi@@ er .
&quot; if someone who doesn &apos;t matter how to make a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and strong &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan finished with the words : &quot; God be thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was correct .
the country , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the news .
and all people who look like Mr. Khan , could no place in this new America in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality located in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ an town C@@ ate@@ ura ?
that music , which is played on both sites , not only the life of the children has changed , but also a very close connection with ...
music , which lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a big land@@ fill , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; one of the old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists , but turns away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous kitchen .
for some years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Music ban@@ de ) is now working in the municipality : a children and adults of existing symph@@ ony orchestra that has found a possibility to over@@ flow the surrounding poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , which is located in one of the poo@@ rest provinces of Mexico , is well known for their drug abuse and violence violence .
but this did not change this after a random meeting with a French pilots who started a musical project , and the Youth did a rare hope .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , the local press No@@ ti@@ cias O@@ ax@@ aca NV@@ I :
as soon as they come from the school , they go back home and immediately after lunch running they race through the well @-@ known roads to go to their great passion .
they always come back and play with shiny eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you can learn day for trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clar@@ inet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , B@@ ong@@ os , and the Con@@ ga .
music from gar@@ bage
more than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village which is practically above the largest waste land@@ fill of As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital city - on instruments that are made from renewable waste material :
music with repeated instruments , made of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycling under F@@ avi@@ o Chávez began to turn samples of departure into instruments .
the instruments were produced by spirits , bro@@ ods , C@@ elli , contrasts , guitars , fle@@ dged , sax@@ ophone , trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one and percussion , which were all produced from the gar@@ bage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music , and music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article by Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez re@@ members a local en@@ ologist and musicians of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , on the starting point :
first , it was very difficult because we had no space for rehear@@ sal and we had to place at the same place where the parents worked in the gar@@ bage . children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something that he had never seen before : a waste made of waste .
today , there is a complete orchestra that plays on instruments from all instruments and is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill ha@@ R@@ mon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ land ) draws on the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tonnes of tr@@ ash each year .
those who live with him and of him are the poo@@ rest - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill ha@@ R@@ mon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra also played his music even before Pope Francis :
those East African countries show how technology and team work successfully combat illegal fishing .
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing was fought .
this entry , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published in En@@ si@@ a@@ .com , a magazine that targets international , prac@@ tis@@ ing solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication occurs in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for joint use of content .
in West Africa was then known that this ship had already been operated in Li@@ berian waters of illegal fishing and sought the other coast of Africa .
the Eastern African countries were up against this , and little gen@@ otyp@@ ing , a bill of this kind to welcome their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the compress@@ ors , Mozambique , and the Seychelles mobili@@ zed itself against the ship . they refused to teach , one of its har@@ bours , and refused to use a fishing in a fish@@ eries .
suddenly , the prime minister of the country was surrounded by country , the Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the Ken@@ yan Fish@@ eries authorities . he is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed .
in 2013 , the ship was sold out from the waters of the region : it was not succeeded to catch up there .
ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia , because of pl@@ undering of fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , the criminal practices and resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal Fish@@ stop ) .
the members of this network are next to Somalia and Madagascar who had six countries that had been displaced from their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are able to work together with them . &quot; she says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable project En@@ ding Il@@ legal project En@@ ding Il@@ legal . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition , is hidden because it is extremely difficult for it . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fish from regions .
by deliber@@ ate abnorm@@ alities of existing laws , using which certain habitats and species are protected , the illegal fishing ecosystem damage , which have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing have been committed by bureaucra@@ tic against illegal fishing and also through the Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , and the tra@@ ce@@ able actions will present in real time , tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , individual countries with each other for example , lists an existing licenses , news to suspected activities or details , which had noticed during a harbour in@@ spec@@ tion or learn .
fish @-@ i pursued the activities of ships also very much , when they move at the open sea , using satellite towers .
this allows to meet the authorities to meet ships which are found in verb@@ ot@@ ted areas , too - about such that indicate that a ship passes away from fish to other ships on other ships .
in the idea of ideas , such investigations show whether the participating ships have a fisher@@ y license , where they were on the way , and possibly whether they have a stra@@ ster .
countries that are against illegal fishing in their ports . what means that ships will not sell their cargo ships in their ports . so that the ships could not sell their cargo will not be forced to be forced , as in case of Prime Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s then significant financial losses for the owners , which means the illegal fishing cat@@ fish are not worth it anymore .
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , head director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a Ber@@ ater@@ company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also F@@ ISH @-@ i .
closed front .
the already @-@ called platform was created to win approximately 20 million USD to lost sales by estimated 20 million US dollars , which lose the eight members of the H@@ ISH network every year because of illegal fishermen , penet@@ rating in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish plants , and is essential because of the region of commercial fish from all over the world . also , those of illegal fishermen .
their practices , such as sailing under fal@@ si@@ tic flag , f@@ ake license paper , indication of Phant@@ asi@@ en@@ ames , f@@ ishings protected species and fishing in the nature reserve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you want to use the lack of international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ wing control system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; , a ship was illeg@@ ally illegal and a country could not say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are not running my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Kom@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ale can@@ yon tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
so far the closed front .
since its inc@@ eption F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in more than 30 investigations to have been involved in more than 30 investigations .
it has been criminal networks to spread the f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . discovered ships that used several mo@@ urn identi@@ ties and were found fle@@ eing ships and were found .
based on his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for crimes committed , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing through large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations perform rather far into the networks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system , the F@@ ISH @-@ i can help to help ships to be more precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , helps to hide the illegal ships .
the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; and we try to cross the cross , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , editor at Tr@@ y@@ gg Mat Tra@@ cking , an N@@ RO , which also offers fish@@ eries data and the F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
some of the ships turn off for example , for example , your automatic identification systems , which they cannot be taken from satellites .
Cop@@ eland helps to build up a system that links various information technology with each other . it is supposed to help fly with more precision .
a model program
yet F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s Team African nations have indeed influence the influence of global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth - with Google and the marine conservation organization Oce@@ ana , opened the platform Global Fishing Watch , offers a platform to satellite satellite system , and with which the position can be viewed every single tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide .
in fact , with the neighbours to get a better picture above , he who does - that &apos;s just meaning , &quot; he says , &quot; he says . &quot; here is a chance for countries to combine and join their resources on the investigation .
we should do this on a global level . &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts , we should run a similar project , which is a global system for the persecution of ships .
there are indications that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only weak@@ ened , but it also sh@@ opper .
ships that so@@ cks earlier without license , hardly with consequences , know that it will be observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i participating countries now accounted for a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , since fishing boats more licenses .
after F@@ ISH fair in Somalia , Gre@@ ko 1 showed up doors , the insp@@ ectors found on board tow@@ s , whose use is forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries will notice this successes . &quot; the effect is strongly that us also have other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we have become a study objective . &quot; in West Africa disappear several hundred million dollars annually by illegal fishing annually .
there will be six countries together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . even they fight the illegal fishing trade according to the same model such as F@@ ISH @-@ i. e . &quot; This is the goal of let , even more such initiatives , and structures can be used in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s younger member states had his first major triumph : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was on the wrong flag . and not only was the ship without a license and have been used , which now has been prohibited .
the ship was also still in served waters which are reserved for fisher@@ man from Somalia . &apos; with the neph@@ ew of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they put a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing @-@ fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time , proof that a special , collaborative work on the oceans is actually working throughout the world . Emma Bry@@ ce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition .
her article appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TE@@ D Education , New York Times , and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela has become more : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of bringing &quot; the country &quot;

after the government postp@@ oned the application of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , re@@ acted the Veneti@@ ans , in whose eyes had been running the negotiations on the political and economic crisis in the country , where they gathered together on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both images from these demonstrations and arguments against them .
the debate is also led in other parts of the country - including in the Flach@@ land area Bar@@ inas , in the central area Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central North of Bundest@@ ur@@ at Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ part@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation deteri@@ or@@ ated continuously , in the everyday life of the Veneti@@ ans , through an acute lack of food and drugs .
many representatives of the Opposition saw in the ten@@ ment of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , the chance to a fundamental change ; however , the re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ance was blocked by the official authorities .
Marianne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises in their latest article in the context of the government &apos;s context :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , which is the highest in the world ( inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and that is the only way to return for many as the only way to take the country to take their institutional structures to conquer and a new government investment .

there are protest@@ ers in the local cathedral , to protect themselves from the police in order to protect the police and determination of the government .

in other parts of the country , a few protest@@ ers tried to hold a police force , including these woman in the An@@ den@@ staat ( T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira ) :

meanwhile , this is a Info@@ Comm @-@ round , which forms the magnit@@ ude of suppression per day :
thus the dictatorship of the country was supp@@ ressed .
many representatives of the government had the vali@@ dity of the demand for a ten@@ ment process in question - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the street .

other words these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which led out of their vision is little against the devastating economic crisis and would prefer to be more critical votes .
they have taken so much - but the fear !

the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced from his father to take the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian town of Cór@@ doba .
in the course of the big La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Cór@@ doba , in the province of Cór@@ doba , in the province of Cór@@ doba .
on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship were committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not been looking for his life .
starting in the Bür@@ de , the same name as his father bear to the most brutal military associations in La Per@@ la who observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family fur@@ y .
in the situation at that time I believed that this was in order .
I felt like a secret mag@@ ent .
as a child , with 15 years you don &apos;t notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I was able to recognise that my father had a di@@ eb , fol@@ ks and murder .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983 , his father from 1976 to 1978 , he became a deputy commander of the intelligence department of 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the lower @-@ gl@@ ands that was indicted for ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had seen the extent of the atro@@ cities , which he had experienced as young , and who had said before an army against his own Father .
his story shows which great power has a parent over his child , and like this child has chosen a way to salvation .
from the Sports Hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I went often with us in the sports hall . there I made me with a young , the martial arts .
all known him &quot; Kent . &quot;
I told my father of him , and some days later he showed me a black &amp; white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you &apos;re a Ar@@ sch@@ loch , you have completed you with one of the ERP .
pass just that they lead you not one day , and I need to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; Party .
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back into the sports hall . some days later he took me with the work on the military base .
he told me , I would be secret magical .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that was in order . for so my father had made me .
at the military base , I had to destroy paper , which had belonged to the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : Universitäts@@ medizin , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simple everything .

over , the prisoners will be tortured .
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in the year 1976 .
for the first and last time he met me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he commanded me to switch to me . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just all possible - stood there .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little in a blanket of pop@@ es and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ums@@ y silver .
at this day , I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ho@@ e , where the stolen items were ab@@ sent and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he said on an open space and said :
over , the prisoners will be tortured .
I mo@@ red into , and saw a song , on the people were tortured .
they looked like a single bed and metal springs .
later , I found out that they had put an end to the end of a cable . the other end was fixed at the body of the person who had been fixed there .
they f@@ ess@@ ated a man with hands of hand over the bed , shot him with water and hunt him a charge of 220 Volt to the gen@@ italia .
photo : Com@@ isi@@ ón Provin@@ cial de la Mem@@ oria
the gest@@ ank there was quite ... how a dirty Win@@ del .
later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body in need is in need .
I never forget to forget this smell .
and I asked me : how is it only possible that man can do one another as much .
&apos;@@ ich knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were found with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and eye bind .
he talked with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who was also charged in the process ) and I took the opportunity to look at a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a series of matt@@ resses , on which bare people with the face down , - all were in hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the s@@ unk humans quiet on the matt@@ resses .
when my father noted that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ st du as , Ar@@ sch@@ loch ? &quot;
I was oppos@@ ing the enemy &quot; Why hast thou me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and was buried in a pit by soldiers .
I know that my father said to the house of it .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms which have been identified as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero went there for a man and killed .
the civilian from the civil society is Jorge Rom@@ ero , who also was indicted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera , Stu@@ dents Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .
in the following video , Emilio Fes@@ sia , the head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , was named by the former fol@@ li@@ ars .
the way you came here on which you came here , is also the way to come back here .
when you look on the map , you &apos;ll see that they were about this track and were then tortured for the first time .
here , their names were changed and they got as part of the process of the process a number .
if they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the arrangement of the above came , they should be laid out .
this was the lies - the Eu@@ phr@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War Crimes &apos;
my father brought all possible stolen things with home .
at that time , at the age of the age , I don &apos;t know what the &quot; war of war &quot; - as it was called it .
but when I was in the military , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that war of war was a Baj@@ on@@ ett or maybe military rab@@ bits , which you have w@@ alled to one enemy .

but if you go into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ tables , clothing , painting , money ... sti@@ cky , then is not a war@@ eness but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always asked me , like my father , the head of the security forces , with this V@@ and@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and me would never noticed it into a house and to steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do it .
once he called me a criminal and I answered : and you , who thou wil@@ t cars on the road sti@@ p@@ st ?
you &apos;re not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded before W@@ ut , smote me and cried :
if you are so far , then I will find you and en@@ cir@@ cled you .
we need no one another !
this was my father .
I have not only good memory to him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I had a jacket and a roller swe@@ aters in wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defense was accused of having committed to his crimes against this crimes . I did not resist , no problem , they can set me at the burden what they wanted .
I was so@@ ak there , to announce that .
&apos; the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ om@@ ful act of the body .
now , where I &apos;m older the age of I &apos;m gre@@ e .
I have children . if you &apos;ve got only once children , you recognize the value of a life .
we are developing and det@@ ects that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have gone out during the dictatorship of people . but to do the body should leave disappear ?
why can lead me ?
one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost as a dog - only that it was a little girl .
I always got the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
it would have been possible to bring it to the prison .
I guess , it was simply decided to kill these people . but to how to keep their bodies disappear ?
in these people , these people had not had their families , which could be given up their remains of the remains ?
the disappearance of the body can be the last ab@@ om@@ ful act to do one man .
my father spoke to me when the democracy was re @-@ introduced , they hol@@ ed them to eliminate the remains of the prisoners .
they were cr@@ ushed and somewhere - no idea , where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my Father .
but anything remains of course .
I saw , as you have killed people ! &apos;
just about it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I even went even with the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just have spoken about the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought to indicate my father , originated during a meeting when he was placed under house arrest .
I had the accus@@ ations because of all of the grot@@ esque , which I had to experience himself due to him .
he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I haven &apos;t killed . &quot;
I felt sad , and asked me , that the whole of the Patri@@ otic Patri@@ oti@@ ation and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; that they are supposed to have def@@ ending well .
then I sent :
how can you like to me ?
I saw , as you have killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes , and you have forced me as a child , to participate .
he only conflic@@ ting only &quot; Na then I am going to . &quot;
exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I ref@@ und@@ able to receive the first indication .
I finally detected , that he was a re@@ aker .
no one can cause me that I am the default . I finally spoke against my own Father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest and still before the end of the process .
he was indicted for 4@@ 16 criminal cases , torture in 154 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 cases , torture with subsequent fat@@ alities in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of one under 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .

after four years , more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial due to crimes against 7@@ 16 victims between March 1975 and December 1978 .
in 28 cases , 43 instru@@ ctors was found guilty of crimes against humanity . the court ruled in 28 cases , sentences and in nine cases , sentences between 2 and 14 years .
eleven of originally def@@ endants were killed during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ iming : murder , torture and rape by officers through counterpart . # Es@@ War@@ heads
all def@@ endants were during the dictatorship of the military , including former military officers , former police officers and civil employees .
Pi@@ ero De Mont@@ i was ab@@ duc@@ ted together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death plant designed by un@@ human minds .
the Court ruling is a historical milestone for human rights organizations that have been working for years on justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , founder of the Argent@@ in@@ ean organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represented the children of men who were murdered in the dictatorship , were killed or disappeared , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ in@@ ean government handed over the country to La Per@@ la , so that there was a memorial site where the human rights have been led by human rights organizations .

a translation errors makes older people in K@@ YO@@ TO , &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation errors can be extended to a centre in K@@ YO@@ TO , where you can extend his license .
the photo was spread in the social media .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of K@@ YO@@ TO , customers have opened a newly opened center in which one can rely on an extremely happy translation in the last month .
on a sign , the Japanese word ( co@@ ach@@ et sh@@ a ) , the &quot; older driver &quot; means that maybe , maybe also with Bö@@ sem , &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; and &quot; terrible driver &quot; was translated . &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September at electronic ads in the entrance hall and in the building itself .
machining of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , divided into the social media .
the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , one inhabitants Ky@@ ot@@ os , retired . he was also aware of the local time at the time .
the Kyoto Protocol , K@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
how could it come to such a English translation ?
this shows that no one has read the translation .
this is a reward for older people and in an international city , such as K@@ un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes .
the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; reception &quot; ( english : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate name , albeit a gramm@@ ar not quite correct name &quot; elder &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police killed in the Kyoto Protocol for the translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the mistakes was already shown in the text , and that the translation was not checked for her judgment before she was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; it is sorry that older people were wor@@ ded by inadequate correction ( translation ) for our part , &quot; said the police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News has a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; was den@@ oun@@ cing as an appropriate description by the police . according to the police , the proportion of elderly people who are involved in accidents are involved in accidents , but quite a reason for concern .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , in 2005 , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , caused the sen@@ iors 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 oun@@ ces .
this share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents decreased in total , the proportion of sen@@ iors had risen in the same period .
in particular , the following re@@ porter in Yahoo published of the article published in Yahoo published in Yahoo published of the article ans of Light , which show the preliminary parts of the Japanese , against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo on the translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible driver &quot; ) about the reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if there is good , the translation is not really not , or ? &quot;
- &quot; I find not find that the real translation errors is . &quot;
there are not a few of these comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread
translation errors are widespread in Japan and Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true locality for this bizarre error in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation items are diverse .
to over@@ lay two important functions : passive language skills to understand the starting text and an active language skills to transfer him into the target language .
the latter requires the active language of the target language - something that is in the case in the case in general , is the conviction that translator in the target language - not in the initial language - mother@@ boards are supposed to be in the initial language .
for example , a French mother , for example , should not translate the French in French - not from French into English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ a staff of English as a mother tongue , translations in English to English . this may be a lack of understanding for the transfer , cost wings , or the relatively small number of English mat@@ ures , the Japanese learning .
some companies that have no foreign employees have to manufacture translations , but then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is actually made , as the translator made - no matter how good or bad to a language skills really are .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
automated translations are also widely used - often with fun results .
the ver@@ ren@@ ches and stock sets , which are taken through mechanical translations , show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human trans@@ lators . this applies to some languages for some languages .
some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the most common prints , often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for stylish reasons - not to be read or even understood .

translation errors like jewelry still acceptable , or at least harm@@ less . but of great companies or by the government , which means the means of ensuring higher standards , you can expect careful translations .

Venezuela : protests and Z@@ ens@@ ur@@ anium measures on the Internet and TV .
main site of Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , mel@@ ted Venezuel@@ an Internet users , that they don &apos;t have access to the online broadcaster Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the Internet performances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible .
other online transm@@ it@@ ters reported cases of protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ position@@ ist groups , which Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government officials .
protests started in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and the tasks of Parliament on the Executive and the Supreme Court himself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tra@@ cer@@ an . he pointed out that the connection can be cut , and recommended the users , V@@ PN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Z@@ enz : activated your V@@ PN .
it seems to be locked to the internet pages Venezuel@@ an provider to be locked .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay , the Veneti@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of ri@@ ots .
traditional media have been around protests in the reporting of protests . at that time , the commission for Telecommunication en@@ forced them with monetary policy and closure after they would continue to report about the demonstrations , as the Commission looked up as a call on violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I applied me at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing , that the lower is lower than two litres of lim@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ let confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay through a sper@@ m of the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online transmitter . this also applies to the website to take their meetings on the National Assembly .
previous research studies of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , showed that the local Internet providers use buses . this is a technique through which the DNS server requests your domains .
if your website is blocked by the DNS , reply the server , or ref@@ uses the request at a call of such website .
we confirm a DNS sper@@ re : @ el@@ ic@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
in V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV @-@ camera Elvis Flo@@ res was transferred to the protests in Caracas , was transferred to the protests in Caracas .
Flo@@ res was beaten , while he was found in police .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again .
even though some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government reported that the government has been regulated by Internet connections - so the Veneti@@ ans will keep access to multi@@ medi@@ al reporting on the current trends in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls get to slave to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was one child a cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visited the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina for the rights of children and collects points out of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , which were exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following item is the short@@ ened version of a report by Kur@@ tur@@ ally , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; flying cows &quot; ) , which will be processed from Global Vo@@ ices , processed and re @-@ published .
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga lived eight years in a household , where they didn &apos;t work together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her study &apos;s gradu@@ ation , she returned once again into the house and heard the owner of the house , and heard about it . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has become a little bit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ enga has never been treated like a daughter .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to work to school .
the shop is quite simple : a great family with little money exceeds its min@@ der@@ age @-@ old son or their min@@ der@@ year @-@ old daughter to another , small family . in the case , the child will receive the child food , a training and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned , it is that the children must be paid for countless days of house@@ work , never to be paid and victims of abuse and missions can be raised , and all that as part of a contract you can not lift .
these as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go called the practice in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of the society and despite many complaints by human rights organizations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ enga has been a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - raised doubts and den@@ oun@@ cement .
they tried to name the things out of the name , because the feeling of gra@@ titude , which is vacc@@ inated to Cri@@ ad@@ itas , is in general confi@@ dential .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double bulb , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga .
it is one of the family to improve their daughter in faith , that they do so their training to improve their position in society and &quot; somewhat out of themselves , &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family , which takes care of the girl , and whose exploitation was justified by faith , making them a chance that else didn &apos;t get any training , otherwise no training would be hungry .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is mis@@ fu@@ elt , his family will experience many years later .
sometimes they &apos;ve never learned about it .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but an face of face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín began to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of hard stro@@ kes . shortly after that she died .
it was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the budget of the former military @-@ owned Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as the government in an area of population .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants on the east of the capital , As@@ unci@@ ón .
by the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira proposed on Mar@@ ín as long as they suffered fatal violations .
this should be the last punishment on the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made deep practice in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s practice for the death of the girl .
they recorded the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest in protest together and demanded that there are no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the Girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows than children , &quot; be@@ aded Tina Al@@ var@@ enga .
without papers , it is much easier , un@@ pun@@ ished the rights of children .
without official documents , it is very difficult to control , under which conditions were boys and girls .
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations were required .
they want to be Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of girls who had sentenced her Cri@@ ad@@ ita to 30 years in prison .
if the case of judgment comes , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín &apos;s landmark might be the case for the first time in history &apos;s history to the case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s history .
everyday life of an Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , Con@@ course , and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to go back to all work and began to sell on the streets or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
they went all to the school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita into the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ enga has taken place between four and six hours each day .
at the time , they had to divide at the time , so that she was still time to start learning .
they stood every morning against five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
Fri@@ days for example , it cle@@ ans the refrigerator , p@@ utz@@ te the living room , polished and to the ground .
when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learning .
ever more she was ready to learning with learning , the more leisure had them .
however , this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ enga says , they had never been hungry , but did not be hungry food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the land@@ lord as food from the fridge , &quot; reminds her .
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the households , an old military and sympath@@ isers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which had been in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in addition to some appearances of the households in Al@@ var@@ enga , next to him , and to read articles from Op@@ tions such as &quot; Sen@@ dero , &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince her , to convince the reports of the official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator .
he kept at home for intelligent , but not by her . &quot; the households had to meet someone who heard that he spoke about politics , &quot; she says .
I don &apos;t have to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I would have to learn &quot; bad An@@ sel@@ ections &quot; to do so that Al@@ var@@ enga that belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , to the native home of Guar@@ an@@ í , to home again .
her Lord feared , that they had the formation they had , but again , she explains her .
her was , however , it was quite clear that she had paid for everything they had paid from them with her hard work .
also in school , Al@@ var@@ enga was discre@@ te . &quot; a thing about which is about ever spoken , are M@@ ob@@ bing and the schi@@ sts of which Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed to school .
because the other children of parents have , they immediately recognize that someone who doesn &apos;t leave their parents to have a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I could not invite anyone to me home . I had no friends as a school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , at the time where friends arise , I felt particularly clearly , that I had belonged to none group .
the insulation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga .
the company cheap to the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can see job all dresses for cleaning and nur@@ ses in Paraguay .
the administration of the Group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ovsky , a city dreams in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter , who plays in the morning and in the afternoon .

please note you .
from Monday , if possible .
the ad got five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place of Ñ@@ by wrote that she would have had a full year old girl and gave their phone number .
another wife , which came from Ñ@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she may be little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
in the third review was written by &quot; a girl from the interior that would like to work . &quot;
then , the Constitution of the ad said once again :
dear friends , I have found . I saw it , if it works with it .
thank you very much , I write it if something is .
the shop was completed .
in Pro@@ log the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long still ? ) , a collection of testimony to say former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes :
in our history , we had made it possible to create systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go , and the Spanish conqu@@ ering of the cant@@ een in Paraguay . that is why we could still use it that many girls and boys are put into a system of slavery , where they are easy for abuse for abuse and exploitation in the country .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the look at power are the key to understanding the phenomena of phenomena known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
legislative bill writes Egyptian social media in front of the government &apos;s business .
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changes from Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliament , recently ordered a bill to &quot; the regulatory submission regarding the use of social networks and social networks . &quot;
if he is adopted by the Parliament , users of social media will need to register social media in Egypt at a government &apos;s government to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
based on the law , then a place was set to use , citizens and citizens have been using permission to use social media .
within six months of acceptance of the law , users would have to register users and users at the site with its right name and number of identity numbers to register social networks .
if you want to do this , this could bring a punishment of up to six months in prison or a money bu@@ ck .
the bill , which consists of six par@@ agra@@ ms and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt , the social media defined as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs on the Internet and is used to communicate with other by voice , video art and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is caused by the law , as Egyptian authorities can use the users and users of registration . not clear , in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation at the stage of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary report and sponsors of the law , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a password for a user name and a password &quot; by using the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocks . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to use a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to those who would be able to submit for the Egyptians and the Egyptians , information on their identity , to access the network .
but it is not known that such plans exist .
experts and experts in front of site are skep@@ tical to the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the Vor@@ um .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Technolo@@ g@@ ist ( based on German ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , on German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , Global Vo@@ ices :
I have strongly strongly encouraged the technical capacity and understanding the understanding , neither authority in Egypt concerning things that do with technology .
in my opinion , they make it so before that as they are violent physical and private rooms , it could also be done online .
when I take it seriously , then it means that they will apply a strong super@@ vis@@ age system to apply citizens , or not . this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people , and also to bring them to a court process .
this is not far more realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
to be adopted as a law , the design must be discussed at the legis@@ l@@ atures of the Parliament and the constitutional committee , before it proceeds into the plen@@ ary debate .
whether his acceptance and suspension will be successful , or not , the design &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in the parliament , in whose sense that no change of nar@@ ration will be present on the image space , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
in the past year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y ordered a bill to the sentence of cy@@ ber crime that was found guilty of life imprisonment for those who are found guilty to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest . &quot;

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of the Iraqi Kurdistan , the Tibetan Buddhist H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from non @-@ governmental organisation , was involved in the spiritual Persian Gulf .
a sub@@ species of the Leop@@ ards are Leop@@ ards by Africa and Asia . overall there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the fra@@ grant of their life &apos;s life and there are always less prey .
why is this certain species of Leop@@ ards so important ?
as R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining people in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem &quot; and the body and the ecosystem of ecosystem depends on it , that there is a large smoking tier .
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards in the free wild cable@@ way is low and goes against zero . when the team in video would therefore be determined that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera , breaks R@@ aza in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza is passionate , one side of their country , not only from war and conflict .

in early March 2017 , for the nor@@ theastern Japan daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o achieved progress to re@@ build the life of those who had been affected by the &quot; Thir@@ ty Cat@@ astrophe &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an Atom @-@ accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its registered office in Sen@@ dai the prefecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture with Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture , who had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring fields of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had to disappear throughout the coastal cities .
at the Fu@@ kus@@ hima City , Fu@@ kus@@ hima City had an accident , so that alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o special report shows which progress had been achieved in the past six years , to re@@ build the life of the local resident .
the detailed report of the newspaper covers both statistics of the Japanese health authorities as well as pol@@ l @-@ results of the people .
the residential building of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that , by December , 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts are registered at the pre@@ fec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate , in the pre@@ fec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ata .
in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , a total of 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has finished 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hima forms the final light with 70 percent .
even six years after the cat@@ astrophe and six years after the cat@@ astrophe and ev@@ acu@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ and@@ ular ( for example , cas@@ u@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) to the final spare parts .
after the three @-@ way cat@@ astrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live from Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ ck for nearly 80 000 people .
in December 2016 , more than 36 000 people lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such elements .
almost 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hima ev@@ ac@@ uation out of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in 2011 , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i lost its successful day . more than 75 per cent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation who have signed after Des@@ aster in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ ck have been res@@ ett@@ led in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is here at 34 percent .
the work of the work and everyday life in the three affected by the pre@@ fec@@ tures
just like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newsp@@ aper , 10@@ 74 from 1100 schools that were affected by the evil forces , its gates until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction is far more difficult in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
while almost 100 percent of fishing pipes in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now operating in operation , Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of fishing pipes have been re@@ taken into operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the at@@ om@@ are accident , have moved in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land in the area of rural area .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed ar@@ able land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is unlikely that only a result of the nuclear power is , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed ar@@ able land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , lies in the &quot; nuclear &quot; nuclear zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , the tourism has recovered back again , but also remains of Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
the tourist rates in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same state as before the evil . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , however , can have only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that , since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their habitats .
is the native population to the next major earthqu@@ akes ?
in order to determine a complete picture , the newspaper brought numerous findings under the native population and under the ev@@ ac@@ uation by . she asked about the stand of the re@@ building and also , as you have changed to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in its introduction of the article describes the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o brought a survey through to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness under the native population of experience .
the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the local resident population , measures have been cleared to future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ ami@@ s in order to be prepared .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of the respondents said that still not enough to be used in cat@@ ast@@ roph@@ es .
as it stands for those who ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima prefecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
in their issue of the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper increased their attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not only had the massive earthqu@@ akes and the disast@@ rous ts@@ un@@ ami - no , the Pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was a witness to the worst disaster of disast@@ rous , at@@ om@@ aren accidents , who had to experience Japan ever .
nearly 63 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were transferred to the territories outside the prefecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent replacement stores .
according to the 2017 stand , there is still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside of their home prefecture .
most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation @-@ areas are most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation which are still going to be able to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima City with massive construction projects . this is a building projects that are part of the Olympic Games , which will be held in Tokyo .
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
if one had met people from other countries , who had a other language , the differences seem to be larger than the church .
after a while , you can often find that more links than it appears on the first glance .
these global compounds are important to challenge us to challenge our perspectives and remember to remember that the world ultimately , however , is very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we cover topics that occur in reporting often less attention than they deser@@ ve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember to remember a moment in which they have a very strong experience with somebody for language and country limits .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ con@@ i talks about the church of Greek and Turkish ; Viol@@ in Cam@@ ar@@ asa speaks about the time where they worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences who has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

the forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso included almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the parish Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , who is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as central Central and Spanish sugar mill - known that there is no wet sugar @-@ specific sugar@@ s on site .
it is two years ago when the activities have been laid down in the sugar tubes factories .
after the result , the sugar tubes in the region was quiet , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the rum@@ ors of steel and concrete remained remained .
about 272 workers had to find new .
some cases the work .
other re@@ signed and pen@@ ile every day to factories , which still ma@@ hlen .
N@@ ene , a soloist of veter@@ an , who stands out every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar tube industry didn &apos;t offer his sleep .
he heard that there are no more active in the east of the sugar cane factories which have been in operation after a long time because they have been preserved .
this was something that he was not expected .
N@@ ene is reminiscent of this , that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , the sugar cane sugar would not be kept , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar tubes industry is already the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the I@@ ne@@ ff@@ efficiency , the bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 the production of 1.6 million tons of sugar , produced less than the 1910 produced quantity .
the news would have been a motive for some decades a motive for the country have been a motive for the country , but the poor did not have any curi@@ osity .
why the Cuban sugar cane has been switched off ?
the old railway sti@@ g of the church saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economical need : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ portable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate on the more efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
only the factories will be left to produce sugar for most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) .
solution for unemployment ?
the motifs , which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar plant@@ ations and the access crisis on the world market .
nevertheless the sugar price climbed to about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar will stay between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report &quot; Land@@ wirtschaft@@ skammer &quot; from the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations .
if the current production would achieve the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar would export roughly 85 million dollars for the country &apos;s country .
not everything was done well
&quot; today &apos;s Day is going to go with safety in history , &quot; that were the first words of the Cuban President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from there , the process of re@@ structured in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the stri@@ pping of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar tube factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked since 1967 in the factory .
if N@@ ene is known as a soldier , about the closure of the factory , the word that he is repeated on most , &quot; fraud . &quot;
nearly all those questioned , same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to get the place , it was a full time working group .
before the first day , the first letters began to come .
this was officially abol@@ ished in the documents that are only distinguished by the parts that are removed , the address and the date would be distinguished .
all were signed by Ul@@ rika &apos;s Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could not confirm any compensation .
from there was the responsibility of the responsibility and the letters came to more frequently .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for two years , and he was one who received the letters , and he received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for that in operation , there was no money , &quot; in@@ sured .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , is waiting for the pension in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was accused of having participated in the dis@@ closure of the factory , where he helped him to be involved .
with every part , he removed , demon@@ ized one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and major work generator was removed .
in many cases , no alternatives for the work@@ places and services , which were generated in the municipalities of the municipalities in which they were found .
we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present people saw that factories for the areas whose factories has been in operation for five years , everything would run good .

after two years , the parish Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , that many things change , but not always the recovery , when a factory closed .
when the sugar be@@ asts factory completed , or better said when they began to mix them , they heard them to asph@@ alted the streets to asph@@ alted all the dis@@ advant@@ ageous people as well as other companies .
without work in the region , and with an advanced age , had to search for N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy other factories .
you have to share spare parts .
without any future , there were also many young people the region .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not used for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene was back to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .

first Nations young people use hip @-@ hop in order to press and maintain their own culture .

youth of the First Nations communities in the whole of Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them . they do it with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
since 2014 , as part of the N &apos; we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour will bring mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were directed by a teacher David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Quebec with ten C@@ ree communities and then worked with the C@@ ree hip @-@ hop group of the North@@ star .
the workshop ends that the young people in talks with discussions such as &quot; cultural identity , language , dispute , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; or whatever you come in the meaning .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which the young people are the main actor .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o , in the territory of the Kit@@ sum@@ um First Nation in British Columbia reveals the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway &quot; in western Canada , on which nearly two dozen were mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were not clari@@ fied .
the next video of the Nem@@ aska C@@ ree First Nation uses the motive of a video game to communicate how important the preservation of traditional seat and customs , despite the influences of the global@@ isation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people , the languages of the First Nations are not always available in English .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First nation have recorded , the refra@@ in on C@@ ree .
the here participating young people received some help from Gary J@@ olly by the North@@ star Hip Hop Group , who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is available in the inscription , as well as translation into English , which is translated into German here :
sometimes I feel me , than would be interested in me for me
but I try my days on earth
that is the day to take you our j@@ rei .
because we lost our way in life , we lost our way to life .
but I believe that we will collect us one day ,
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life .
so , they can grow and go as well as our youth .
so , you can do what they have determined the cre@@ ators .

in Japan , one can see almost each restaurant plastic dishes .
to show potential customers exactly what exactly on the menu if you are at the menu of sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( first @-@ out , &quot; plasma models of the courts &quot; ) from each dish that serves in this restaurant .
the clients see these plastic dishes and decide if they enter the restaurant .
there is an entire industry that dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic meals .
in the to@@ bog@@ gan district Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small companies that made those plastic dishes created by the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a , over 20 years ago .
most of the Japanese have these plastic meals are so usually that they are not able to rely on them . however , a new trend is turned into most striking mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos which show this unusual Twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic sh@@ ew@@ ed cell belts , as they are shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
many of these artificial food were turned into kit@@ esur@@ fing objects , such as in this case , refriger@@ ated :
here are a few sho@@ cks and refriger@@ ated for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the essence is increasingly elaborate .
in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel shell with seafood ) turned into a cell phone .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand .
this part is also part of the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is a apple that make your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , that is a great design for the phone , this is a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight to the Comintern .
some mobile phone and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case i@@ cur@@ a or salmon has been used , a popular t@@ opping , served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
for someone there would be someone who say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can di@@ gesti@@ ble my mobile phone with salmon ? . &quot;
I think I will probably be the introduc@@ tory .
this interest in plastic j@@ acks can also accept a less@@ er loss form , for example , colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant .
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting the ice .
in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ crafted from dried salmon .
another qu@@ op@@ le plastic meals can be seen under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter on the h@@ ash@@ tag # 6 .
if you want to learn more about the origin of this trends , you will find an insight into the Pu@@ ab@@ ashi district , which is dedicated to the restaurant industry , for example , for example with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic meals are actually made .

in reports and foreign media about the inf@@ amous &quot; struggle against drug trade &quot; in Mexico , there are missing and Get@@ y regularly only in statistics on this mirror , however , not the extent of the human tragedy is against that battle with themselves .
reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Ch@@ apo Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ ells , ur@@ ged the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone on the grape or to the municipalities that learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone bank in a hundred and heated tom@@ bs , the stories of numerous parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , their legs may be healing .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal &quot; A@@ pr@@ un@@ a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; to learn the drug to learn these victims , and the stories of people who told them to en@@ forcement agencies in the fight against en@@ forcement agencies and anti@@ trust authorities .
the project describes the project so :
organized crime , we do not only fear our lives .
the effects are much lower @-@ reaching .
for example , if shops include , because they need to be threatened by drug addi@@ ction , and all municipalities like that many kilometers have to go to buy a little bit like milk .
the pain of the victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a major character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who search@@ es every weekend secret graves after his son .

there is also my mother , which is also here with me .
at the moment they have no income .

where should we get the past ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ un@@ a vi@@ vir con el nar@@ co , &quot; why the project is so important :
we don &apos;t have to show the faces of those who are fear of fear . we need to show the conflict and show the conflict and state leadership .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a writer of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico wrote this post of Tax@@ co , set up in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that man should never be regarded as normal as normal , in which form it occur :
yes , illness and Sens@@ ation journ@@ alism is now I &apos;ve been a few years ago .
I come every day to newspaper ki@@ osk , and see the title pages with pictures , that &apos;s actually only consist of a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists .
it comes from the version .
sometimes I feel the feeling when I am the her@@ mon@@ ed or sad . it acts as a lack of respect for the person who had once belonged to the body .
I cannot be even valid or be normal as normal .
she writes :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old C@@ ous@@ in consider that he is big . and it is not normal that people can hear songs about the &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ ations &quot; of the Stra@@ ins , when they go through the streets .
for me , that when they would have those who have lost someone who have lost someone , and those who fear have so much happens .
I see our weakness when stories are to blo@@ oming numbers in a statistics .
the Tat@@ en@@ nia of man is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbour can be justified that they were &quot; s@@ acked . &quot;
I think they try to talk about such a load of ships if they are not stir and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. out of Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; four months of salvation in the main city district : &quot; it describes how armed crimin@@ als for month money was destroyed by the end , but by the end of not only the business was destroyed , but also their family torn apart .
you think about everything you have lost , and how some people may change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain is never done , the g@@ ma remains , the fear is high when you are alone .
habits have changed , telephone numbers also .
we only ask us even if it is absolutely necessary .
depending on the other , it is better , the better .
she completed her report with the words :
we want to be arrested that the others was arrested , because we don &apos;t know when they lead you or kill you .
I asked me into this terrible days , if wines my deep root feelings would cause me , but the answers is no , because I don &apos;t forget to live with the pain . I have to learn with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a new generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction , he performs questions on how : who care about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by the organised crime ?
how is it , in a settlement on the edge of the most endangered city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents is to take care of her age .
Bryan is a orph@@ ans and he tells himself that he &apos;s himself to bring a egg , Pot@@ atoes , Tor@@ tillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for Bab@@ ies , who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of small bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year old .
however , they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ le@@ ased for a boys for the whole life of violence and they had to learn to live .
when he was five years old , he said to him that his mother is gone .
but this was not the day where his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years ago , when he was just a few blocks from his home , the bloody bodies of his father saw , who had been shot by armed men from a driving car .
when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez , looked like :
Bryan was born in 2006 , as violence as violence and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most endangered city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Civil Council &apos;s Security Council and the government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the Public Prosecutor 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this is equivalent to 8.5 murders per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that organized the organised crime in Mexico , and perme@@ ating the soul of the country .
only few stories live in view of the new head@@ lines . this project reminds us of those who we don &apos;t forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ un@@ a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; a project organised by the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ a a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; whose goal is to know the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trading , which has undergone the country in the last four decades , in under@@ stand@@ able manner .
if a picture of a thousand un@@ true words is worth
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this entry and pages , which he is left , all images displayed on which violence is depicted .
the facsimile check is important in a moment , in which it &apos;s going to lift up or a counter@@ f@@ eit , or a counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing .
but how is the years after the first time it is di@@ pped ? content in social media , regardless of whether true or un@@ true , tend to exist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accidents seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first release it was irre@@ voc@@ ally used in action since its first release , they have taken place in Nigeria , Nigeria , which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this wrong copy of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; fal@@ cons context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
it comes with questions about our long @-@ long images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC )
in 2010 , a tank trucks crossed the village of San@@ ge in the East of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ ed and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been negle@@ cted by Africa . the streets in the region have become dangerous p@@ itta , which were difficult to keep difficult .
however , the tank trucks fell victim to the victims .
it is described by a fire@@ ball which bl@@ asph@@ alted houses , including a cinemas in the vicinity , the full of people who had the football World Cup .
houses and mixed cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets of the streets .
many people were burned to non@@ knowledge .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur users Mysti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ multiple photos of the event make the gru@@ es@@ full scenes of this day .
above , an example of this is an example .
it shows rows of fo@@ als , which are on the floor , during people they look .
but here the story is not its end .
over the years , the same photo goes on several times to social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , but certainly not to be attributed to the lifting of life , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar .
on 3 January 2015 , the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the remote village of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported to have to flee from atro@@ cities where they had to flee .
homes and shops were burnt down in the streets and bones were burned in the streets and Geb@@ a .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one stayed back to count LEICA , &quot; said a inhabitants of Human Rights Watch .
many were cr@@ ushed , shot or burnt .
only from satellite imag@@ ined the follow @-@ up period could be depicted .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army corps in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military in Nigeria and the attempt of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , to win the country ( examples of the year 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here &apos;s the picture of the DR Congo is back on , when it was more suscep@@ tible to the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
you are not Charlie .
you are dead .
in fact , this fe@@ a@@ sible use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of patches with flaws ; Africa check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was launched as a reward for massacres .
yet another step further bring to personal comments such as this example , the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the image from San@@ ge appeared also in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash , published by the United Nations , those who could escape the stro@@ kes , rape and several dead , some of burning .
while others reported violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya reported Po@@ sts , such as the following , that these descriptions brought together with photos from the DR Congo , brought together :
this picture comes from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab news page , who claimed in 2012 , President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s expressed himself in the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to get this information .
the original contribution , on which last updated on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations that AFP shared as their source was also fal@@ sely seen Th@@ one His His statement , but did not allow the image out of the DR Congo in connection .
the worldwide operating range of false statements
tracks of this wrong coupling &quot; goes back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
you can see how far the borders , can be seen as far as information limits .
a moving picture search with the search engine at the Tin@@ Eye has seen under 18,@@ 8 billion paintings ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the above picture of the DR Congo .
they come from a mixer , private pages , platforms , social media and community and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have false reports , united , have others tried to make counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing .
we have examples of the use of mis@@ use and use them in conjunction with the respective countries , on the basis of which they were published , on which page they were published . therefore , we want to reduce the reach of more than by the language alone .
from the bottom of listed countries ( which were associated with each other cases ) , several examples of mis@@ use are used for mis@@ use .
some cases which can now be fully shar@@ ded yet ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : news frames .
country examples of false copy of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria , Myanmar .
the orange countries are still available on pages or server , via the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ings or Fal@@ con@@ messages are still available .
the countries in grey are examples that are available according to the met@@ adata and information which have been available on the Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ f@@ law@@ suit .
as a memory , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma , Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture of the DR Congo was held in an online discussion forum ( attended by Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a threads for the &quot; War of the Budd@@ hi@@ sts . &quot;

Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia provides two extreme example of the image from the DR Congo , with one role , the sympath@@ y against the Nig@@ erian massacre , and on the other hand of a blo@@ gging , the alle@@ g@@ ations of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , but the photos of them were ab@@ duc@@ ted .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the government of Myanmar published a judge , what they worked as &quot; ab@@ orted news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create abnorm@@ alities regarding Myanmar . &quot;
this judge , which has been published exclusively in English , has also been used on f@@ ake images of rum@@ ors , those who kill the Muslims of Budd@@ hi@@ sten , and the other rum ( what often used by bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox church , demonstrates that the image of the DR Congo will NOT be Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news site has been revealed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ a His 2012 was alleged that Mön@@ che and politicians participated in the kill@@ ings of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim , and brought the story with the image from San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication , the picture is still included in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article , published by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic news site An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly stated that the image was not from the daughters , but it claims that it was a &quot; similar d@@ schi@@ p attack . &quot;
as a picture later , in connection with the massacre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am of 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to prevent it to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burning , the world ) .
the image of the DR Congo , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and saved a discussion under Muslims following the massacre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 and at Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities took place these events that took place in the name of Islam , a larger attention .
United States , 2015 .
the image was sh@@ aken by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ ains ) , but the messages that were linked to no religious context were taken out of religious context .
instead , the objective of attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of media coverage by Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( 1 ) , 2014 .
after a message that allegedly was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ erian massacres , in circulation , discussion discussions like this here on Vietnam and explained it to Fal@@ sch@@ berg .
from the message , in which the image was included in the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ an mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are further confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other Ac@@ counts , generator and pages in the following countries ( at the portfolio in Grau ) , the Tin@@ Eye also boasts more completely re@@ tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data agreements with UR@@ Ls and time / data stamp ) exist on the web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and have en@@ acting on image file in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , that was only published in the original manuscript from 2010 , the image may probably be correct , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and images
there are two strong topics or frames ( sub@@ frame ) that these po@@ sts go through . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence of Christians through Muslims , or in the defense of Muslims - the victims of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as .
a second Fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how a African life has been assessed by a European or French life .
religion understand , and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it &apos;s worth to investigate how images are used in connection with these efforts .
another question is however , what happens when reading these images can not give longer faith .
with social media , there are two people who have un@@ intended to practice the water around a tragedy .
the mood of the mistakes and false information is that actual gent@@ le@@ fts are un@@ true and im@@ pe@@ eled it the actual grey of what is actually in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the spread @-@ violent images was already presented at detail in detail ( here , for example ) .
a argument is that the return of images is rec@@ eded to detect the tragedy . from time to time , these pictures can even be carried out by the victims .
at the same time , the concern that they are violent images , readers , and viewers , and to see them the ability to emp@@ ze emp@@ athy ( such as a violent media to help others ) .
while some are violent represent@@ ations in the news media , we are estimated that they are indispensable for the present news release .
Technolo@@ gical experiments with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; you &apos;ll have to think about the situation , in which a picture is somewhat different , but in which context of the context or on completely mis@@ use type can be used .
one of the investigation is supposed to be taken into consideration , however , how international them can be taken into consideration .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Sim@@ mons use according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name of Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. d@@ t. unbe@@ atable ) , language classes can do a selection of words from all over the world , which would not be difficult to translate difficult or at all .
such words are available in each language : you want certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ affected words are already well known ( as the famous Portuguese acid ) and others , which in a special culture is deep ( for example , the Spanish Sob@@ re@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all conflic@@ ting are hard @-@ looking any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes something background are necessary to understand exactly what a word is meant .
these unique words were collected for a whole time in an online list .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese , or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird chose to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog , we find the words of the VAT from Van@@ u@@ atu , as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ü@@ h you need to recognition your parents in recognition how to have been around in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik , spoken in parts of Brazil , as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or fi@@ aul@@ ness , which one feels feels to be washed at the cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog Over :
they de@@ grinding other cultures , reveal other reas@@ oning and w@@ rest@@ ated our curi@@ osity .
sometimes , as we do not affect our world around the world , and classified the lingu@@ ist on this site even more of these &quot; invisible &quot; words , and how different , evalu@@ ates and impressive this small languages .
speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are very estimated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite here .

as Sri Lanka with the worst flood cat@@ astrophe of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is located at the moment of the worst flood and flood cat@@ astrophe in this decade .
triggered by the Mon@@ sun , who normally operate at the end of May , through strong rain@@ forests the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ t@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to a statement by the Kat@@ ast@@ roph@@ ages of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missing due to the flight and mor@@ amm@@ ers .

the rainf@@ alls left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and water resi@@ des in some areas went back .
health and hygiene conditions of the population provide a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the subsequent pictures and videos give an impression of the size of the flood cat@@ astrophe :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water stands of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka are providing regular updates to high water sports .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of cat@@ astrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s fatal crash , the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ ddle crisis , save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls have already been on the way .
tomorrow , the clo@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also was floo@@ ded because of the world &apos;s water peg@@ yl@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for emergency rescue operations and further five will be completed to transport of emergency deliveries in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and start @-@ ups have explained to the help of various organizations and start @-@ ups .
Facebook pages like help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ cent Sri Lanka deliver important information about the flood situation and humanitarian aid .

the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f app Pick@@ me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to divide their site data with the help of the app that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ Center is informed .
last year after the trop@@ hy of the trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ anu , picnic a &quot; flood aid &quot; button , the users allowed users to call for a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then re@@ directed to the s@@ wis@@ s Red Cross .
as a result , they launched a &quot; SOS &quot; button , which had more than thousand requests and 150 successful bo@@ ret@@ ali@@ ases to be carried out for high tide and dr@@ ut@@ ational people .
the unified efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka are fully exhau@@ sted with several social media platforms , will bring people in need in need of security and provide assistance .
this has prevented the loss of further human life , the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to recovery of the norm range .

use g@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and friend .
I trusted you my four years old daughter , they are familiar to me their children : she is my rock in Bran@@ ch .
in one minute , we call Par@@ olen for women &apos;s rights .
next year , we will en@@ code the rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the icon@@ ographic picture of a woman with s@@ ack@@ cloth , bound from an American flag , and other channels the par@@ abolic against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
my girl@@ friend is looking forward to me , saying , &quot; these things are not affect you , or ? &quot; why , because I don &apos;t have Musli@@ ma ? , &quot; qu@@ ery I am .
I have already led this entertainment .
people who work with whom I work , or people who have been know me since years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar which they know - from the extensive concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their notion .
you arrive me .
there are around 1.7 billion Muslims in the world .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practic@@ ing our religion .
we may be able to be Muslim to be aware of different kind . but somehow we will be able to invite all in the same Muslim dra@@ wers .
this dra@@ wer work is so good in our collective presentation that as soon as Muslims who can &apos;t fit there as I do not fit .
Muslim men will be Muslim .
I am not alone anymore .
this is even the poet , whose poetry is sold in America is : Rum@@ i .
what pictures come from one in the sense when you think it &apos;s ?
love ?
peace ?
as Jal@@ alu@@ able in Rum@@ i as old as I am now , he was a Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and scholars .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day , at which he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the Western show , religion were deleted , religion , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this lion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of the induc@@ ing images of Muslims , the Western books had already been colonial since the centuries .
these lock@@ able image is determined by the dark men that should be fear and the exotic woman that should save .
the pioneer of Palestinian @-@ American scientists Edward S@@ aid fell down the history behind these images in the 1970s .
but this pictures may also be out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood news will continue to continue .
I worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I saw , like this powerful , faul@@ ty inter@@ locking of our News@@ feeds .
this nar@@ ra@@ tiv amounts to reality , which have led over the past three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries while the United States were not able to choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .

back then , when Khan was re @-@ out the Sky@@ line of the world , my parents were un@@ avoid@@ able by Muslims and Americans .

I sh@@ ear , we do not bear all T@@ asch@@ enk@@ or@@ ane with us .
we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or by almost always for additional security check in the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholar , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists , which are depri@@ ved of Islam , widespread over the Islam .
these lies will be produced by the ongoing band of a well @-@ captured Islam@@ opho@@ bia with money transfer , Thin@@ k tanks and experts for Fal@@ sch@@ information that are already faul@@ ty image of which a Muslim is ; or which is Islam is manipul@@ ated .

I want to declare .
I was born as Muslims in 2008 , but a Musli@@ ma was born , when I was four years old when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social activist religious life , they attack on the following terms : believe , Behavi@@ or and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim belief and behavior are maybe not always visible , but they are here .
maybe I would be my girl@@ friend , my neighbour , my rock in Bran@@ ch that I am to see Muslims in Bran@@ ch when they could have a 15 @-@ meter @-@ concrete structure and air take out our homes .
she would like to see the all@@ ure of my daughter with my daughter , if I pray them in my arms , and to protect the Arab verses to protect the Koran and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them come back for three times .
so please note that she is protected before the evil , E@@ vil , you can see and the evil that you can &apos;t see the evil .

the initiative of stor@@ yt@@ elling wants to keep urban language diversity .
lending list , from Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
may it be a possibility to enter here and now in spite of a language barrier with somebody there ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the stories of stories in its original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently over a different initiative of Steven Bird , the Un@@ re@@ cover@@ able blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is a try to get the language variety of big cities and to recognize them .
indeed , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in the United States , where T@@ LS have already been carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not completely so small languages are not given to the children born there .
for the purpose of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided , when we create cities , diversity - secure spaces , in which people don &apos;t forget to belong to them .
while &quot; listening to it , &quot; to understand , &quot; check out these events instead , &quot; the listeners will instead to estimate that &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , exchange counter is their history first in their own language and translate or explain it to English .
even if the participants are not a professional counter , their de@@ vo@@ tion and their representation make sure that the audience could be realized .
they call for laugh@@ ter and emotions , when the language should not be longer a barrier .
the following video shows a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which is tells of a traditional story of Burkina Faso . during this round , R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou cons@@ ate the opportunity to explain their land typical of stor@@ yt@@ elling of stor@@ yt@@ ale .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the be@@ ak of the bun@@ ni@@ es and the pas@@ sports in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe .
after he explains the importance of his f@@ be@@ ak , John Ny@@ am@@ ara asked me : &quot; how is that in an audience that your language does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide condition , he shares his feeling of the inclusive :
you have heard !
they were attention ...
they were very happy with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organizers aim to extend this . all who are inspired by the project , can enter contact with T@@ LS in order to organize their own interests performances .

this is your call :

we require immediate action .
the island - not in the states of integrated territory of the United States , is suffering from a major financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a pro @-@ independent non @-@ profit organization without party leadership with focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing State Court .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ri@@ cos require a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
from the outside , measures have to be taken without the participation and the conviction , the citizens can be rejected by the people .
the demonstration was called &quot; Nach@@ tw@@ ache for Light and Truth . &quot;

but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , supporters and members of the campaign for his freedom , and remember the contributions that he has paid for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , which is annual conference on the digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , dedicated to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ ai , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara Rü@@ hl@@ ing , Managing Director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house within three to five days , las@@ tics from the book cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ qu@@ iry ( The cost of Freedom : a collective post @-@ research ) .
the book , which was released last year and is freely available , includes a number of articles which employ @-@ free culture in the face of suppression .
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is :
this book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge and how the true costs are associated with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researcher , researchers , and authors have worked on the movements for free knowledge , to look over the ne@@ b@@ ula , who gives our news@@ feeds and create a little sense of our experiences .
this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , to liber@@ ate the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteers who has been in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was taken from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
we have since then do not have any information about his current state or position .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title of collec@@ tively , gives his friends and his family a voice that , for his release , and who want to know it back in his normal life and freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel has a high price for its participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own fat@@ alities , deeds and decisions .
are we here ?
we decided to do ?
what we found in this process of extreme transition effects ?
the web developer for open @-@ source and digital activity has been in the detention of Syrian authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel from A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility was transferred to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi told that the &quot; military police Bas@@ sel was based on the basis of a &quot; strict ban &quot; in the military court of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it was cont@@ acted on 12 November 2015 by people cont@@ acted himself as In@@ si@@ der of the Assad regime and put it out of an alleged death against her husband .
the residence and condition remain still unknown .
a pioneer in Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a decisive role in which access to the internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ v , a designer , Technolo@@ ge , and at the moment of the head of the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that Bas@@ sel founded , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
maybe none of Bass@@ els of cultural prototypes was pre@@ dic@@ tive as the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologist and 3D artists around 2005 , designed to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the way of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and of the Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with hi@@ es@@ cent traditions and per@@ si@@ can influences .
in that time , Bas@@ sel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS was doing everything that architecture is not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world em@@ bodied .
this strip , into the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a period of time created for the public , as well as scientists and artists in the future of un@@ inv@@ alu@@ able value .
this project was not able to close the project so far .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her man to share his knowledge with other , even during his time in prison :
my whole life spent my whole life to dream of freedom and bas@@ sel teaching me , she was poor .
I am overwhel@@ med when I am his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English in English , even when he was found in prison .
I learned English to read English on to write and speak English .
he always has given his knowledge with each person who asked him . he has taught other in@@ gest@@ ed , English to write and speak .
Bas@@ sel has opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones .
he brought me the Internet for me .
he has also brought other in@@ sured , as they use the computer , at least theore@@ tically , without that it had actually stopped in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a commission , which she wrote in prison in the years 2012 to 2015 .

Mos@@ ambique &apos;s : due to corruption prosec@@ uted director after arrest warran@@ ts back on previous post
Mos@@ ambique &apos;s re@@ acted with wrath on a corruption case in which a government member , after half of his sentence , returned to the workplace in the state of corruption .
this is the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment with four other accused of accused of genocide by 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( approximately 800 000 Euros ) .
the money came from public money of the airports of Mozambique , the Council of Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good lead and demanded immediately its restoration in the company , what happened on April 19th then .
in accordance with a statement of the General At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s Office of the Republic , which granted the application to refer the request to refer to Cam@@ ba@@ za , back to its old post since the company had no disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , hot many inhabitants are not good .
the center for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle , the decision of the company , to put the director again :
represents a backward step in the fight against corruption and clear the feeding of transparency and even a backward step in respect to the efforts of our legal system , the C@@ IP .
what we refer to the knowledge that the company would have to carry out a disciplinary process against the influ@@ encing trade .
however , the company sch@@ wie@@ g seems to be there and causes no appropriate legal steps for the application of the appropriate functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Muslim social media , reflects this behaviour and considered the case as &quot; contradi@@ cting &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be advis@@ able to be convicted after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them saved .
he could not paid presentations and motivated words , he could advise and his Image pol@@ ishing .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has been involved in the company that he helped to add damage to the company .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will be paid for his silence .
resistance !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique , and student of Political Science in Brazil , he says the director of no mor@@ ality :
Cam@@ ba@@ za will be rewarded by the state , because he did not believe it to someone in such a way that the state has already been massive massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing the Mor@@ al and return to the state , * he had already serve a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead , only himself served on the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state , as hand@@ ing it himself to become an in@@ exhaus@@ tive money source and the state itself , this man has become tired and finally sentenced to a long sentence of prison .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why the man was so rewarded .
Fran@@ ce@@ y Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , remember that a di@@ eb was in prison .
Di@@ ebe belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el the Mos@@ ambique &apos;s not only for ever as the first independent president in memory , but also as a scar@@ ves , and as well as sharp - A Proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations , when he confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is being able to be able to sell his own interests , its own individual interest , to sell his own interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that not so . he changes the tac@@ tics , but he does not change from his ambi@@ tions .
an ambitious Man is a criminal law at the same time . &quot;
in Twitter , reactions were also wor@@ sen@@ ing :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down in 10 years and was free .

according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network gave her podium from the net , because they were the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although above the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin or in general as Ad@@ jek@@ ectively . &quot;
Facebook tells the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or so @-@ in @-@ mice ( in bur@@ mes@@ an Scrip@@ ture ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of Hass@@ elt in Burma in the social network .
over the past years , the ascent of radical nation@@ alist movements has given an extremely low account not@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by Ultra nation@@ alists as Hass@@ elt to Muslims in which a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat the language in Myanmar in Myanmar , the company has a lot of sensu@@ al content on his platform .
today &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be brought together with rac@@ ism in conjunction with rac@@ ism , but the word is not allowed to be removed from Hass@@ elt .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that po@@ sts , in which they have used the use of the word , or doubts about his use , have been committed .
in addition , there are several bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic different mean@@ ings which have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ mes@@ an even &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , as well as other words as &apos; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( age @-@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ch@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was er@@ ased today , because he contained the word of Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends to spiritual kind , whether they could re@@ using his back pain , he made a word game .
the Batter@@ y la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + The question word ( la ) is very similar to the ra@@ ci@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ur is the opinion that they would be a group of radi@@ cally nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook analy@@ tic will have to spread all Po@@ sts sol@@ dering to spread over the killing of rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; is no manually manual . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it automatically filter the word automatically .
the monitor will not understand what you don &apos;t find on the Fac@@ eb@@ ox .
what should make it instead , the mail is carefully sent to analyse and check it the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; ( age @-@ age ) .
the good thing is that these three @-@ called nation@@ alists , have spread out a rather good lesson .
now it is at the time to contempl@@ ate their nation@@ alism .
while the promotion is a strong signal to everyone , the Hass@@ language could spread the efficiency of this strategy are not long .
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proved that the users of social networks are simply plug@@ ged to begin to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the set word to press their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to er@@ ase his podium when he wanted to know his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
ir@@ on@@ ary , my post was removed by Facebook and me , the li@@ ken , item , and parts of contents for 24 hours , because the Post Community Standards are not assigned to &quot; the Facebook Community Standards . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of Po@@ sts from people who don &apos;t have negative inten@@ tions , or simply try to show their opinions against Hass@@ elt &apos;s radi@@ cally nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post has been removed to do nothing with Hass@@ elt :
post @-@ speech by Facebook is removed from Facebook .
in the post , the author announced his mind about how extreme National@@ ism and religious grounds are po@@ alism in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook is said before the beginning of the initiative more , for example the bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community will ask the Council :
Facebook may have a charity intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work .
such words to sh@@ aving , will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
in addition , it seems as if they have begun a local context or technical support , and as words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; have been banned .
even when they found out that they have made error , they did not tried to make the random podium .
if they were only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefit , which had a great turnover , would be a great .
bev@@ elling automatic c@@ ens@@ orship has provided users with plenty of spending under the users .
instead of getting serious , users can now look forward to Facebook and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ elt to see if their podium will be taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts who don &apos;t have Hass@@ elt , but still removed :
permission used .
the bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and see an Indian film .
only to try to try whether Facebook contains the post , the word of Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot , with approval .
the Post states &quot; If you are a doctor if you are healing for people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot , with approval .
in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fin@@ alists , have used social networks to expand their votes and their influence .
among other things , Hass@@ elt is believed to remove violence in the municipalities in Myanmar in addition , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where they were forced to flee from Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sten to flee .
Facebook was said to be for his say that grew up in Hass@@ elt to his bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but rather than just like the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to work on the context as a code concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is finally filled with the children &apos;s before .

the kinder@@ garten is now illeg@@ ally illegal in Trinidad and Tobago .
on 9 June 2017 , the country of the country has unanim@@ ously adopted a law that this practice is to provide , so that the heat @-@ able age now at 18 .
before this amend@@ ment to the E@@ hot law , a group of religious communities held in practice , and in May 2016 , the leader of the inter@@ religious group ( IR@@ O ) , a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state did not allow the state to have the maturity of the maturity . &quot;
this happened on the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is one of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a Parties to the UN Children &apos;s Convention , the min@@ ors who is to be defined as people under 18 years of age . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married with 15 were married , in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical division confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social @-@ media movements that were cast down , laws of children &apos;s disease followed , followed at the foot of the foot and fre@@ ed with great support . however , they helped to bring this result .
nevertheless , not everything are smooth .
a Hin@@ du @-@ leader , for example , had no concerns the critics of the children &apos;s before , they should have to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition made possible for ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and sometime , doubts on whether the opposition would agree to the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided to participate - despite the 4 Senate ( including a woman ) of the Opposition and an independent that could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where he could make a simple majority him to law .
now only the President of the country need to agree , and approved the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave to Facebook an status update , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m again :
Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the Children &apos;s Treaty was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes in favour and none of the other .
after having decided in the Senate , the design can now be joined by the law .
the majority of social media users were thrilled to have been changed because the laws to child were finally changed .
Facebook is a member of the Lov@@ ell Francis , who said a Minister of Ministers of Education , said :
it has a lot of time and un@@ question@@ able Ger@@ ede , used the core of the thing , but you know what ? the children &apos;s before is in Trinidad and Tobago now , and that is almost every prize .
while Abel , the opinion of the opinion was definitely lasting enough to create the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas took the very happy that the day had finally come :
public status update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ ent@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , , Tra@@ vor@@ ing News !
the E@@ DC Act has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 - for - 0 against ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group , which was quite openly said , how important the adoption of the law was observed :
the hei@@ g@@ able age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of religious den@@ i@@ ority 18 years .
the draft for the amend@@ ment of the E@@ DC Act was today , on June 9 , 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 MP and of which 35 were present in the vote .
all members of the ME@@ Ps , voted against the Law .
the children &apos;s disease is not allowed in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # el@@ age@@ ish@@ il@@ d@@ ashboard .
many thanks to all activists , who have exp@@ elled him .
congratulations to congratulations .
a Dan@@ ke to our ME@@ Ps .
but there is a possible hook in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , as Secretary General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ organization of the country .
before months ago , Mahar@@ aj has proclaimed his intention to promote judicial steps , the law should be passed ; and he appears to dis@@ solve his promises .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney of Paris , Al Ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of law , said it is quite certain when Mahar@@ aj tried to go to the law , the most social media users would take the debate on the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rell struck in front of :
dear Sat , if we want to talk about the problem , in a way that we want to keep the state in our bedroom , so that it may be possible by big , tough men that are likely to be ab@@ sent to them in the advantage , &quot; would you ready to continue the discussion ?
or believe that it is not a problem ?
however , whether it is an important step against the law , or not , these legislation is an important step - but there are still places of places in the world where the children &apos;s disease is legally binding or even the standard , even though it is the laws containing them .

by the spy web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again Wikipedia content .
the English language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright laws in the United States , internationally .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than a month , Turkey has been the popular and popular on the crowd sourcing principle based enzymes in Wikipedia .
day for day , more importantly , how important the platform is to find , helpful , as well as reliable information and share .
both students and re@@ porter and fans of TV series are against the sper@@ m .
although many independent website uses Internet users to use , change tools for block web pages ( a current article by the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest V@@ PN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most important Wikipedia users will not fall in this category .
although Turkey has been revised by Wikipedia articles , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , held regular block@@ ings of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
to China , Turkey is the most famous land in the world , when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remain locked , there are several Mir@@ ror pages ( pages , which will be updated with the contents of Wikipedia ) and often updated .
a solution was made by IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform conver@@ ters all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( e.g. calcul@@ ator computers ) , which is based on the system of domain name and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult .
the content is published in spite of the legal ban , however .
in a blog post reported IP@@ FS about his efforts :
after having heard the messages ( about the sper@@ m of Wikipedia ) , we put it all that sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the ability to read the content on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed way .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if you can &apos;t reach www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pp@@ org website himself .
IP@@ FS also gave the fact that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation and is merely a screen@@ shots and no Live@@ - or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia participated in other efforts to avoid the sper@@ m .
Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy , as also the Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can take advantage of similar Mir@@ ror sites to ho@@ sten when in the respective country will be closed .

it &apos;s no complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , one Mir@@ ror .
it does not take action to another URL which is not the original . that &apos;s what you see , is from Wikipedia .
essentially that the server leads the request to the right Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the content from Wikipedia to Wikipedia if they are locked in Turkey .
because this is executed by a server , which is not in Turkey .

used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos which he saw around it , never be satisfied . they were missing , with bad positioning of mo@@ tive and balanced colors .
the motivated him also to bear a camera , and try to try the situation .
he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , she endeav@@ ors to bring Sag@@ ar to bring Nep@@ als of wildlife to the international stage .
and his hometown directly next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos , who are the attention to Nep@@ als animal world .
it described on Facebook as well as this first @-@ class location with his work :
I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage site . what could be better for a passionate wild photographers ! !
I just finished home , when I suddenly got in Navar@@ aj ( the Manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my Father that at the bank of the Rap@@ ti River would be a Leopard .
the river dam is just a few minutes from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I went out with my camera and was in just a few minutes there .
my father had observed him , and showed me the place on the other river side , where the Leopard was left , and I started to be tri@@ cky ! !
Sag@@ ar is seeking to achieve a collaboration with the authorities in order to achieve global recognition for Nep@@ als , and would like to realize that wild animals not so fear@@ ful , as they look like them .
and he should know , because he stood as Tig@@ ers already from the face to face :
a tiger can not be heard from the opinion of sheep not at sleep ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
also , I was because of the darkness in the darkness , when I appeared to the king of the book . he is immediately ready to see us and he star@@ ed down by the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for &quot; ( lit . : I cli@@ cks for the environment ) on his photos .
his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als and wild , however , is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , mostly in a tent in order to make the Bar@@ dia National Park footage from Ot@@ ches . up to 12 days it took place until he took a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist accommodation .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a , and originally appeared on video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community of media organization from India .
a revised version was again published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women with the greatest care , the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead , they use a P@@ ron@@ omen or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pradesh , women thought to be respected as well as fear of the consequences , they ought to be ab@@ ide with the norm , those practices on life .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced to O@@ dish@@ a by the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a , and by their family and the village community , after having had a secret relatives with names .
the tradition of wives also do not name to name , even under the name , is also common under men . however , they will be far worse by far , if at all , they should not be retro@@ sp@@ un in this practice .
in the small village Wal@@ he in the village of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health staff , house@@ wives , a unique Club , and thus became the main theme of the city .
it is a place just for them alone , on which they discuss the enemy of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss .
as one of 56 clubs , which is located in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , operated by the community of Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and is taking advantage of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine worked for seven years with help of her video am@@ era at the lifting of practices , such as children &apos;s council , and AIDS In@@ ds , and manages this clubs .
it is reported how this clubs has created a safe place for these women and at the same time , they have made a secret place at the same time .
the first video to show Roh@@ ini in her discussion round , was the name of women who did not call for their hus@@ bands .
it has chosen for this subject , because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with an issue , to identify which women can easily identify .
the name of their hus@@ bands do not respond to the question , is an Br@@ itt@@ ens , not guilty , and have not guilty them in question .
Roh@@ ini said :
this tradition has testi@@ fies that a woman named her husband and wishes a long life .
a woman that doesn &apos;t exist . is regarded as a woman without Mor@@ al .
the tradition is so deeply wor@@ shi@@ fted that we have made us up to this discussion round .
at the beginning of the Roh@@ ini , who wanted to work with her husband so never called , at home , in order to try out how it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ law mother .
Roh@@ ini told :
my wife &apos;s mother and my husband had a long time after the video was at the end .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , has made himself to me and said , I asked him from now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first Dis@@ cussion Pap@@ ers .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it meant a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pradesh .
after the video projection , the women tried to bring the discussion with a exercise in speed .
Roh@@ ini bat any participant in the name of her husband with various feelings - happy , ref@@ uses , sad , lov@@ ingly and so on .
then she asked them , &quot; If we can &apos;t say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they may call us how they want , means that they don &apos;t have to mount us ?
should not be the same as good ? &quot;
some of these women have been married since 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought up the name of her husband , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the break of a centuries @-@ old tradition that would never have to speak for the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini told :
a woman was so sh@@ y that during all the exercise there was only about k@@ ich@@ ri , one another decided to allow the entire fru@@ stration against him and his family to allow him to leave him .
the expression on their core was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in the case of A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ ine , in fact , with an old Br@@ itt@@ ens , the women have decided that they would actually trying to try their hus@@ bands to name in their name .
and they held their word .
in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what they continued to say women in the head : his wife was not able to hear his name .
another club member states decided to do it with dinner before the whole family .
she was her father @-@ in @-@ law , she was afraid , and said that it was a mistake .
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I thought to do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less common and the situation art@@ ete in violence .
Roh@@ ini reported how women tries to stop many practices , such as the interest of interest in red dot on the fore@@ head , who shows the adul@@ est@@ atus .
why only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would bear the interest in the red point when he was too .
he l@@ eighth only and I heard him to bear him .
the other women do not belong together , but my , they are now in a better position , even to choose him to some days .
for many women , the Dis@@ cussion Pap@@ ers is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives .
&quot; we do a trip at every Dis@@ cussion Pap@@ ers .
normally we have lunch and water , and go into the field .
I don &apos;t want to make the women to make those who could hear what could hear , &quot; says them .
in the last few months , she celebrated her own birth days in her life , she danced with cake ; they danced , and s@@ essed them about things that never had never thought of them .
Roh@@ ini said :
I &apos;ve been working on this problems since so many years , and I have also been about some things , for example , as our identi@@ ties in our hus@@ bands are not so honest .
it &apos;s feels great to say that certain things can be said , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talk about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothing .
some women in the group have been worn since their marriage in Sar@@ is .
for most of most , the okay , but some wanted to have a Sal@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta , a vast Hem@@ d of a trousers , they have not bad .
after a lot of battle and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes , the Mor@@ al inter@@ connected with the Sar@@ is and much more , sh@@ mu@@ g@@ athers their own pair of course ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so that women could carry them .
next , they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where she can bear je@@ ans , and Roh@@ ini can be sure to create it .
on the question , whether in the five months have been changed for the first Dis@@ cussion Pap@@ ers , Roh@@ ini says that the things come to the roles :
we have made small steps so far .
some women have pro@@ visi@@ oned it a few times , but heard it again to say the name of their hus@@ ks .
some , including me , are still included , but only if they are alone and there are no other family members .
only one or two say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women do not bear at every time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their fore@@ head .
the women in Dis@@ cussion Pap@@ ers know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the flow to freedom of movement or their own hang@@ ers - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river .
by making other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
as Roh@@ ini explained :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
it also have been too .
but this club gives everyone from us the confidence that will change something .
and I know that there are not only limited to 30 families . it is a chain reaction if any woman in the club goes home and other people , what we speak , and what we do .
we sit all in the same boat .

the visit of the Beatles in the year 1966 in Japan is considered a hon@@ our@@ se in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war era .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Ru@@ mi@@ ko , who was inter@@ viewed in London in 1964 , observed during the 50th anniversary of the first visit :

Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a town or a country ?
the question may be dum@@ m , as Singapore is recognised at the international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was considered to be regarded as the city .
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of a meeting of the International Relations Association of New York , the ministers noted that many people have critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because it was compared to Singapore with other countries .
supporting the city of Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has put on question whether New York is a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , although most people go to an error .
I tried to declare that we are different .
we are a town .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ erio accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; The logic , &quot; to defend the existing exercise of the power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and lifts , this valuable land to create , you can say that we are finally not an country .
it was so vul@@ ged to vul@@ ged it , so it had a escape of a flight before the responsibilities , a mandatory injury .
Singapore if you are not my land , you eat land ?
the reasons were not very no@@ ble : he defended an idea , according to which it could not measure the political system of Singapore not with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of which he appeared un@@ crowded .
in contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equal to cities which are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democra@@ tically elected .
once you reach the core point of the river Th@@ as , it will be the good old dead bodies of the authorized power of Mach@@ th@@ ab@@ ern who kno@@ cked to demo@@ crats , since it fits better to their power .
in the end of the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ te , the answers to its American guests regarding our press , our Ju@@ dik@@ ative , of our political system really non @-@ rep@@ lies .
appropriate questions tar@@ red with non @-@ answers ration@@ als .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls to Shan@@ mu@@ gam , his opinion , as they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
when Singapore is not a country , but a town is , so far , our city is one of the city ...
shortly , I understand nothing .
I would be very grat@@ eful when our current K Shan@@ mu@@ gam would take trouble to clari@@ fy this point when he was able to clari@@ fy this point when it was to be part of the government of Singapore .
by adding An@@ on on the blog about his comment , he should begin to read the entire tran@@ script of the conference to read the context of the testimony of Shan@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore was a city , and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
as he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city , &quot; be regarded as a country , &quot; he declared why the elections in Singapore has so much easier , even if we enjoy free and wonder@@ ing elections .
he was able to win Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw decades had won a party ? ) .
when he said , Singapore &quot; was not a land , &quot; he did not take it in this sense !
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment over Shan@@ mu@@ gam , the leader of a long @-@ growing generation , such as the leader of a growing generation .
I &apos;m talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said to ...
at least , I knew about Lee Ku@@ i@@ Y@@ v , and the members of the old Gar@@ des , which I expected to agree with them or not , but that is another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I &apos;m sure I &apos;m not sure if he really believes that he is right , and that he is aware of what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review breaking down the weakness of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam &quot; Succ@@ ess@@ ful a mistake , &quot; or was it a pleas@@ ures speaker ?
if Singapore is not a country , we will only be regarded as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on what land continue the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equal to the land and city .
as he plays an important role within the government cable , the testimon@@ ies from Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam of serious significance .
why do the people are more expensive in their military service , they only defend their city but not their land ?
if our Prime Minister have to pay our Prime Minister ?
what is the value of our pink identity ?
are we citizens of a country or the residents of a city ?
if the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade on the preservation of Singapore , Singapore has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have not told what I said &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence appears to have many people more expensive ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city centre / island state .
I can understand that we often hear how &quot; the defense of the country is above all &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct .
we should talk about the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; net@@ ten Canadian &quot;

screen@@ shot of a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked me short of his editors : what is the most ab@@ used aspect of your residence or home ?
their answers are displayed here as part of a ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world , and another Fac@@ ette will be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question of which is made in Japan by most , is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I am coming from Canada . &quot; I &apos;m coming from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan .
depending on the situation , the conversation is taking place , it is considered cour@@ te@@ ous , interest in his disc@@ ern@@ ing partner to show personal questions .
on my clarity the standard response follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans perhaps inside before W@@ ut if they are kept for Americans , but also un@@ spo@@ iled .
for anyone who don &apos;t know , there is little that differs from the Americans of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans create a Canadian flag visible on their back@@ pack if they travel to their back@@ pack .
all love Canadian .
by contrast , the American ... .
it was also that 20 years ago , when I began to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ung , before the invasion of Iraq and the 11th September .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn out small A@@ hor@@ n@@ als on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons !
the same E@@ hen I have been legal since 2005 in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are obviously a very often &quot; resolution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is reportedly considered to be considered the toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as such as these types south of the border .
we are nice .
I h@@ asse the same .
first of all , I have many American friends , which I have very wonderful .
it would not be sure if one would change me with Johnny from Dallas .
Marc out of Austin .
Adam from San Francisco .
Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first : as &quot; nice &quot; is to be referred to as &quot; nice &quot; is basically , we are basically - as the cargo , soft , but the most significant figure N@@ ed Flanders out of &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian twin home ) .
if Canada is truly a nation of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would be a step forward . but the actual problem is in fact that &quot; nice &quot; have no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing that you encounter .
harm@@ less his , is in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting , and no attention to earn attention .
that may be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , down from the things that happen around a round .
I would even go as far as far as to say that the desire , free and alone to be one of the Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own matters .
what &apos;s standing as &quot; nice &quot; can be viewed , perhaps simply cool hum@@ or .
Canada is not often talk about the fence surrounding the neighbours .
we are missing the hot , open kindness , which I now integrate with my American friends .
luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Jus@@ tin Tru@@ de@@ au to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans more than just &quot; kind . &quot; our Prime Minister has made a sexy .
music video , pop band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one of Thailand &apos;s famous pop band has been published in Thailand , that the j@@ unta was par@@ odi@@ zed in 2014 , to restore the civil government in 2014 and despite their promises .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( Pha@@ det Girl ) , the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who told him his girl@@ friend .
although not expressly politically politically , the music video gets indirectly upon the persistent military power of Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users to describe the situation of the country .
the video for song was a huge success .
within the first three days alone , the Facebook was divided into Facebook for the first three days and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; Der dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand , following a group of activists from the public , to view this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics as a special and entertaining introduction to the Thai policy , as it resi@@ sted with the situation of the country under the j@@ unta rule .
once a look , look at the videos of the video which relate to some of the political themes , Thailand in the past three years , Thailand in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section of 44 of the preliminary Constitution , which led to the Commander in Chief of the He@@ eres , which provides important national issues .
the 11th Ru@@ le : &quot; change your setting , &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are regarded as a critic .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear regulations often be used by the authorities to bear the activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , as well as online content and persons accused of having accused the monarchy to de@@ filed s@@ lander .
Thailand is a strict committee against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic stones ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was right in Thailand .
two days later , it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems faced that the j@@ unta &apos;s decision is to buy U @-@ boats , even though security experts they war@@ med it that the purchase are unnecessary and a waste of control .
in the video there will be shown that people will be thrown into a black delivery van before they take into a Inter@@ ni@@ zation camp , another problem .
some journalists sit in prison because they caused the confusion of &quot; confusion &quot; in the society , and they are threatened for a long term of imprisonment , they should leave the monarchy .
meanwhile , the Te@@ aser of the songs of the band , which was used by the Sal@@ ut of &quot; The Tri@@ bute to Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by the coup during protests in the protests .

there are now over 20 years now , since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ian war officially ended , but his sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic .

villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mara , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Kh@@ arch@@ il@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ basin of Ab@@ di@@ ah .

many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the largest part of the Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases are living in the area .
such settlements are called to the gh@@ ost cities .
there are more than 10,000 people in the pre @-@ war period , there are only a few hundred people in this gh@@ ost cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district of 16@@ .000 people , after they had hardly increased over a decade .

people who once lived in this place and their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have left the district .
in the Gei@@ ster@@ stadt D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha living about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mara there , in the other villages it looks like .
the chron@@ icle of the chron@@ icle , which is still one or two families , can be seen in the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out from the window of a destroyed house .
when she re@@ discover me with the camera in the hand , they go back immediately .
&quot; our mother has forbidden us so that we can let us that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is simply forbidden , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl were fle@@ eing her girl@@ friend , and suddenly leave it to the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence industry ( cultivation of agricultural products for the own needs ) such as livestock farming , be@@ ekeeping , and vegetable .
it &apos;s difficult to come into the laps .
the district administration provides free candles and bread on the villages in winter .

many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , there are rather somewhat with pl@@ ings .
after the war there was hardly any work , and all they lived as it was quite .
I remember every day , as the city and the war were once . &quot;
as our conversation , at the end of the end , ren@@ nt the little boy to us .
he runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball from the window and another young boy gave him back to him .
he plays with the ball , then fry the hills .
a group of children are pursued at the ball .
while they run , some of them stones on the ver@@ ty buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood that make for accidents in their lives .
you don &apos;t know differently .

in Mexico , &quot; m@@ um Africa &quot; houses with its long journey
Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez is a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our Partners PR@@ I.@@ org website and appears here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants , Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located at the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city centre .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink Bri@@ ll@@ en@@ coder and gold @-@ coloured ear@@ rings in Ted@@ dy@@ bears @-@ Form .
she is called Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather they themselves ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian , who are on the journey through .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,@@ 50 dollars per night , the guests can sleep in simple rooms , with cold , cr@@ um@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom , there is a par@@ rots in a c@@ age .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless , hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants are here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , come the people in full mini@@ bus and from the upper part of the coast , they start to call : &quot; m@@ um Africa !
where are you m@@ um Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also sle@@ pt outside on the box .
it would not like to reject anyone .
they also helps them to hospital , and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , they buys them to pay them that they cannot pay them with a Bal@@ sam within the long journey .
Ty@@ chic@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , is arrived in a short time ago .
I asked him to asked if the Mama is a reasonable nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who gave a jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ ard ) posi@@ ert with Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to her , as African women are very nice women .
very aff@@ ection@@ ately .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very well here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to Boston to come to Boston to get there her husband and the three children .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for a few Afri@@ cans , who are on the way to the United States , normally make a normal stop in South America and then go toward the north .
the family had heard a well @-@ known name from m@@ um Africa . &quot; m@@ um Africa is a well @-@ known name on the circuit , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest of Haiti .
he tells us that the Hai@@ tian and Afri@@ cans often come together to travel together and that Afri@@ cans already say to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his com@@ b@@ ills , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in before and has worked as construction workers at the Olympic Games and the football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy , he began his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa : it sells SI@@ M cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I qu@@ ery him if he will contact us in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; m@@ um Africa &quot; is our mother and we will never go back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reply . &quot; we &apos;ll always stay in contact . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells you to send their guests her often text , when they continued to leave them , or to get her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of their work .
they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her , chicken like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only spark@@ s hope for migrants , who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valencia and his family are recorded in their little house .
he is Poli@@ z@@ ist and has found that the bus services have sold numerous African migrants .
he started to help them to help an reasonable price , he then offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment , 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tian .
some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
in Valencia , Valencia explains that he knows what the guests make the guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; I experienced what she experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we have suffered .
there are places where people help and others help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was transferred to a raid on his work in the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels across Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other residents open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez told me that he fled in Honduras with his wife and his three children before people fled from him money , without a plan to have a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked after an accommodation and a unknown , omni@@ directional , all its roof , has offered him a roof .
a few months later , the family lives still since and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of m@@ um Africa , everything was full of guests .
in the hall@@ ways the travel@@ er can consult your phones .
a small bus is now arrived and has 20 new guests , a majority of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about that its house is full , but it is also the nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother , she sh@@ aken her album with many photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair , who has made her a client , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travelers more , kids and old .
they battle sad , while she is brief for me .
&quot; Ya , &quot; Ya , &quot; repeat them every time . &quot; she is already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users &apos; s &apos; s &apos; s &apos;
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in the west of China , are forced to install a Spyware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi a mobile phone notification in which she has called the District government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
in the notification of No@@ tification , the app is said to get access to terrorist information . &quot;
but k@@ ò@@ n@@ í the authorities also use the app for more than com@@ b@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h prefecture , because she had installed the app that had changed messages with a private and chat group .
in the notification of the police that the app can determine the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists and would follow , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs Website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system @-@ categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Tel@@ ecom .
the main function is the block@@ ation of por@@ no@@ graphy web pages , by online sc@@ am , Tro@@ ians , and Ph@@ ot@@ @-@ pages to make users how much time they spend online , and to control the own home network .
these app with the filters for min@@ ors will help to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can be used in many different ways .
for example , the &quot; remote remote control could be able to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person to manipul@@ ate the home network .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while news information about digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly on the experiences of users in major cities in the east and south , is the reality very often of no@@ ster@@ er for those who live in remote , ur@@ ged ethnic minority regions , such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
for un@@ rest and un@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities are often linked to extreme poverty and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ inely and rout@@ inely on the Internet .
based on Twitter based media out@@ let &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( for example , the zen@@ ith News in China , displayed photos by a Check@@ point where the residents of the residents are viol@@ ated if they have the over@@ flow app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian represent that the people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
mobile notification demanded that the people will install the app within 10 days .
if you have discovered a check@@ point with a device without these software , they could be imprisoned by up to 10 days .
this is a refund for the technological development .
you have forced to re@@ sign the people that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity via Permanent monitoring technology .
we are back back in Ma@@ os China .
in addition , &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( for example , a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which means that the software allows the ability to lift up of a Windows operating system and receives un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard disk .
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and cell phones to X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city party , to minimi@@ ze dissem@@ ination of illegal content .
all the government , authorities and related institutions , including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office for operation of their computer and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , a US @-@ American Human Rights organization , mentioned this new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a call on your personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards .
the intention is obvious that &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy this promotion . however , this promotion was given three million inhabitants , and gives them straight draw for a whole range of other possible associations , such as those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : all sh@@ opper to death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo of : Cor@@ rie Bark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activist , Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane is accused of his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world , you know you and stell@@ ar that you &apos;re completely gone on a place where it is perfect .
everything has been following and dissolved a truth , the clear is clearly recogni@@ zable , both from inside and outside .
one who makes its name all honor .
one that has beaten in a list of feelings and expres@@ sions , that doesn &apos;t allow the met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if you take off the reality once again and you are behind the scenes , beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and convenience - turn the characters in nature , meat and blood , and all scre@@ aming to death .
all doubt dis@@ solve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the Earth is caught between the walls , your parents are caught between the walls , that your parents , and in front of them your grand@@ parents , stone are built around stone .
they have made me and my father three times , but this was not enough to say &quot; my L@@ ection ler@@ ne , &quot; as Chief of the Security Council , stated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he exhibited his power about us of proof by even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we didn &apos;t know .
five young people were torn during a peaceful protein such as we@@ eds in the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to write the city in the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; write .
all the urban districts , just my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ ur@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I don &apos;t have a high demands on a city , which up to the arter@@ ies with state security life and its compli@@ ments .
in the third night the things had a little cal@@ ming , after the power supply took place in the quarter .
I got through the silence that I used several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice by the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends leaves great enough to work enough .
I wasn &apos;t alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we conducted ourselves with a splendid picture that my expectations were full and fulfilled .
in such a moment you &apos;ll be aware that you have the Spirit out of the lamp , but it is interested in easily in the barley .
I got a call from my Father : &quot; makes you ready to meet us at the military safety building . &quot;
he laid on .
then I learned : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can return to your voice , after you have sent you all the way up to the office of security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father had already been there , as I have now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak , &quot; Let me listen to me as you &apos;re &apos; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; . if you are only courage to write enough , if we are not nearby . &quot;
his h@@ ass@@ ess@@ fulfilled eyes were made in me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you sad about what to look at the eyes and not on the floor ! &quot;
what I did I did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my door@@ ness , E@@ it@@ el@@ dest ; perhaps part of the Revolution .
I was my thing to me , when I answered , &quot; I have not thought that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I never heard it to look you in the eyes , so why should I do it ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such a fat@@ alities for me , and yet I have not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is equally true and his father with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal to &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gest@@ ank of this con@@ flu@@ ence , it lies in the nose to the nose .
he was exposed to a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a lack of torture which I was exposed to monthly .
I crossed the farm .
in the first office I leave everything that I live with me .
afterwards again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through an corridor to the single cells .
I pre@@ dicts all details exactly one , before I decided in the room .
otherwise they have shared a bigger cell in this time .
I have to share me with just one single prisoners , and may now be able to wait without any other permission .
after a few minutes , like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I left the back of an old communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my tick @-@ rade was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ sth@@ tive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long pause , he answered me .
apparently , in none of the surrounding cells , there was a highly respected man @-@ aged , which is similar to me and called the doctor . &quot;
in the total darkness let do not recognize any striking facial features , and doctors are not here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; perhaps someone , whose voice is similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all rep@@ lies with an existence of existence .
maybe he was transferred to one of the major cells .
maybe he is immediately interro@@ gated .
the investig@@ ators had as@@ sures me , they would keep him free discount when I keep going back .
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
I would like to have had a bird number , in order to distribute all these crow@@ s , who lab@@ eled to the fruits in the garden of my head lab@@ es .
from the he@@ arken , I don &apos;t hear &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be approximately 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always at this time , the terror , each day .
the door opens .
I was always confident that Schwarz saw the color of the earth , until I saw the yellow light that gave us the grey in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ ts to 13 S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
you are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot;
this was the secret of money in order to protect us . in order to prevent the heads of security against us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect , so they played their s@@ ect@@ ur@@ ry card and give the close view of your world view .
here is no house which is here is no land ; it is a curse that they call Ko@@ enig@@ ma , to turn the crimin@@ als of her c@@ lans to a hero .
I spent the hearing and faithful at Abu I@@ mad , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes with me so before .
he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; Con@@ vers@@ ation , despite the face of face , &quot; my boy , you &apos;re still young , you can begin with your life , when you want to join this diary , and to protest demonstrations , that may be soon to be found at the end . &quot;
I was not answered .
I have heard it to reply , not to reply .
I can really say no more exactly , when Bel@@ ei@@ vers@@ y and stro@@ kes have become a friendly conversation for me to a common communication .
when and what happened , was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to be pre@@ am@@ per@@ ed to me , though I had to be pun@@ ished , even though I had done anything to earn this sentence .
on penalty of all its diversity .
his command is to ri@@ p me as much meat like possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is called the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , that probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker erg@@ y@@ t herself write to your write .
give you the pleasure , you can not measure you with him , and you can &apos;t keep your voices .
my Schre@@ ie fell not enough because they were the tube through a cable .
with my first arrest , I asked me whether the investig@@ ators worked earlier than waste , or whether it was one of the normal working equipment .
they had four cables in each other , to present us , from their view , great invention of a huge cable .
within a single hour , three of them left , while I was still working on the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and even my voice , which I heard them heard .
the hen I noticed the cooling and found no essence of everyone , which is why he is one of the most invited staff .
electricity through my whole body , enough to supply my entire quarter .
my semi@@ n@@ ack@@ ter body , which was stretched to the bottom , was the perfect power manager .
the Tau@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had filled its mandatory for this night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep myself to sleep myself ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours went to me , who came to me as minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
I response with the voice of a used young people : &quot; my lord , my father must make a terrible wor@@ ried . &quot;
&quot; be silent , and save you , you will go . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
wherever they run me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b speaks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , free differences and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b screw@@ ed a cigarette in his studio .
the picture was recorded by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b is bringing the most of its time inside ; times it up on his screen to his computer , and again at its couch .
what you can leave , however , you can discover a cigarette between his fing@@ er@@ adi@@ ers or with a Niko@@ tin lips .
he lives in the upper floor of his family house that ended them since 1967 ; in which Israel finished his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ da@@ i@@ b family looked forced to move from their village in Palestine in which she had lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : Farmer ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is an passionate activist , who is the conservative majority , and their well @-@ approved opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality , and free differences between art and Rap@@ ture .
with his music , which often refers often with topics such as ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of the whole Arab world . all these topics could not only be found in his hometown of relevance but also in cities , which will be in Yemen from Damascus to San@@ aa in Syria .
with its 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted through limits , and he can feel that according to the disast@@ rous consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he is not open , he is a special landing against the US American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b believes that his comp@@ assion of those who try to survive in war @-@ areas , anything else to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian poultry &quot; - that he was born himself , even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own life , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b .
then it adds : &quot; I think we have rede@@ emed one man , while he dissolved the nest @-@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; in this period it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise up to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law states that the public distribution of food during the Ram@@ adan was illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness in order to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee was to do little with protest against Islam .
basically the mud @-@ l@@ warm coffee and the wa@@ ders of Kent @-@ cigarette in the nose to the first line of freedom .
sometimes it feels like a prison in opposition to the neighbouring countries , above all when you have a look into the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it &apos;s easy to do basic things - as in the public during the Ram@@ adan water - to drink not in prison .
recently the Interior of Jordan did a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
a few parliamentary election , the Islam@@ ist branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual fron@@ tal , Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , speaks of the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , speaks to the country &apos;s cultural and traditional grounds of the country .
the MP and former press review of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN reported that the concert was &quot; just &quot; due to the sexual orientation of the singers .
many claim that the band &apos;s commitment in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free differences in the Arab world was endangered in the Arab world , which represents the old legi@@ timacy of the whole region of the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;s L@@ eil@@ a inv@@ alu@@ able the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters , &quot; which continues to use &quot; intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not easy to be s@@ ne@@ yed by the rhet@@ oric , but actually an even clear @-@ out @-@ crystalline reality in Jordan , however , is clear to the privil@@ eges .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b traditional Gender an@@ men came to Lei@@ be , having formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vo@@ re@@ hel@@ per sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently unknown woman whose arms and legs were up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who are actually confidence .
in the past years , the number of &apos; honorary mor@@ de &apos; took place - the un@@ official outside in Jordan .
Human Rights Watch reached its cli@@ max . however , the number of honorary infrastructure reached their cli@@ max in 2016 , however , the institutional infrastructure is missing to support women who attempted to support women and domestic or domestic violence .
according to a law on the crime effect from 1954 , women who have been suspended in prison for un@@ certain period , &quot; and for their release is often a years of bureaucra@@ tic effort and the guarantee of the family needed to happen that the woman is nothing happened .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs Music is pleased to announce great popularity and is well known for it , also not before subjects , who in his country have been a tab@@ u in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b , at the time , his work is politically , it took place , however , that he can record his music , the full of explicitly claims to sexu@@ ality , freedom and opinion , is not able to separate politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , a man .
I hit politics , &quot; he says .
in a song named &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question according to the Palestinian identity in the attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs , which are politically active in the core .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , a verse is repe@@ ating in a verse :
you are free , and every other is it too . &quot;
in the course of the songs , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market that can get in his words , &quot; which you can get &quot; - be faith or non @-@ faith , h@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he realized that hardly anyone in Jordan on the rights of gay , and readers speaks and that comments on the equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were still held up in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ anic Online program RO@@ Y@@ A to remember that his comments made from the context , turns off and his opinion .
&quot; on You@@ tube , it was uploaded without a cuts that was stretched , but was only a working version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is open to the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that Int@@ oler@@ ance on homosexu@@ ality did not say to Islam .
he mentions Abu Nu@@ thing , a poet of the eighth century , who still remained with his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems today .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks : when Abu Nu@@ thing , who later should work on behalf of the cali@@ bre , was supposed to write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jordan could not do it ?
the actual problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled , too .
in the h@@ ash@@ emi@@ an Kingdom it is nothing new , that the government attacks on free differences , and the progressive votes will be brought to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service took several former government officials and members of the apprenti@@ ces@@ hip , with the accus@@ ations , they would have vo@@ iced on comments in social media about problems that related to the land of corruption .
in view of this , the concert is H@@ da@@ i@@ b , according to the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the actual challenge is , a structural change in the next generation of Jordan &apos;s next generation .
for him , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a is a gig in a row , but the way of progress - so it &apos;s h@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought @-@ thought and inner changes . it is certain that these changes have take place every day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
finally , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also , of an Arab world without inter@@ interventions from abroad .
he has not only dre@@ amt about his work until Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will be using music , art and literature of a real and fundamental off@@ ences - and not caused by bombs , streams and in artificial kind . at least he hopes that he hopes .
until the way , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to pass and dem@@ ise with the resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these great , extra@@ vag@@ ant soldiers are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is believed that there were a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festivals , which are usually represented in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us , and during a period of time today , in the northeast of Japan , in the northeast of Japan , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , to ob@@ lige the K@@ nie .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to let us a few great seats , so we have a great view .
it can only be difficult to imagine how large these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( dic@@ tionary ) .
I watched the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two mo@@ vers are just to see .
nevertheless , for many people who take trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the only truth - and it &apos;s a breathtaking way to spend his sum@@ mers :
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the North of the country .
I was there and I &apos;ve seen the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 metre @-@ high drive was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , outer appar@@ ition and body are so important as in this history , as they help to promote the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dress@@ ers .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us major port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , in the vicinity of the historic centre of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where road rau@@ b and illegal drug stores are daily .
one in April 2017 , published that 5@@ 1.5 per cent of the population do not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - how many other medium and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and saf@@ es are also the unusual hair@@ style of famous sporting events such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Peru ) , led to that there are more normal citizen into the experienced hands of hair@@ style which can give these complex hair@@ dress@@ ings .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ style , which go to the extreme borders of fantasy and creativity , even has an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dress@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; has been taking place since 2014 .
here , experts get back to , who can select from them the ex@@ centr@@ alized L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( other videos to current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
education facilities such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found himself in El Call@@ ao , found here a opportunity to see their weapons against hair@@ dress@@ ings and instead of bad advice on a hairdresser in the hair@@ style that makes them possible to find out work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school was offered by the school year , beginning of the beginning school year , and reported on some of their successes :
we were the only professional school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud , because of love for children , we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love brief@@ e to Guer@@ ill@@ ak@@ apo

use with friendly permission .
the following article is the revised version of the Beit@@ ra@@ gs , &quot; Liebes@@ message of guer@@ rilla forces , &quot; which has published an international online magazine , Tea after T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here in a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write a love brief@@ e to people who we know ?
is it not yet much more important , people who feel out , aff@@ ection , aff@@ ection ?
this question was the question of the young Colom@@ bian activist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga by the foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ art and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os on the campaign of Cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people tend to sign up letters .
recently , her country was the site of a historical event and they wanted to contribute her part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the guer@@ rilla movement F@@ ARC ( english : revolutionary Armed Forces ) that forms the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
international was the sub@@ mitting of peace agreement as so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , before the column is still a long way , until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
it has lived for many years in illegal camps , many years in illegal camps , and around the clock have contributed to their weapons during the clock , and have to integrate them into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society in turn led to life in continu@@ ance and in some cases , deeper hatred of guer@@ rilla forces , these now have to hold their ranks in their ranks and support it to build a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young column will close together and help with the integration process .
and they did that they were too : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - Liebes@@ message of former guer@@ rilla forces to welcome them back in the society .
the aim of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ rilla forces - that will then be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letter to reconciliation was held at the World Summit of Peace Prize , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to talk with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we love the people that we love , on Valentine &apos;s Day , thousands of love brief@@ e , but those forgotten that they want to know much .
he plane , he told , he told his love with people who needed his love with people who needed for urgent .
thus , the plan , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , which can now find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot;
previously , the campaign were collected more than 2000 letters .
the initiative is represented in all major cities such as Cal@@ i , Mani@@ z@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos; I have never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over at the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region on 19 March in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo by the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation , to bring the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC were so on how they had done earlier in order to take the commands of their leaders .
but this time it received no commands , but letters full of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck , and everything that in between &quot; says the political science student of Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a employee of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable event so :
after having responded to the letters , led me a former fighter through the camp of guer@@ rilla fighter .
when I saw one of the &quot; Cam@@ ry &quot; ( a kind of refuge in which the guer@@ rilla forces living ) saw , I saw a guer@@ rilla with a bit .
I &apos;m afraid to go up , because in addition to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ egran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Dorn@@ bracht sleep .
I spoke to him , saying , &quot; hello , what do it just ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I reply to a letter I wrote someone else .
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life , someone else has a little so nice , so that I am aware of . I suddenly got the che@@ eks with the che@@ eks .
I stum@@ bled him and put me in addition to the pom@@ egran@@ ates .
perhaps he was also tired of the war , it was tired of all the years of faithful companions , and he wanted to write this letter to this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never was anything else that the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the famine . &quot; I have never thought that someone would be given for my error .
but now I know that there is a company that is waiting for us with open arms to us .
until now I &apos;ve only learned about weap@@ onry with weapons .
but now in peace , I can learn many things and work in D@@ ign@@ ity . &quot;
new voices
to start students and several leaders of the F@@ ARC on a discussion panel .
the students were all up and raised up as a war , and the F@@ ARC were already acting in ob@@ sc@@ urity .
therefore , the F@@ ARC leader of the organisation , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process . now , where we have the possibility to develop ourselves with a political party , we can help to design the society in this country .
for a goal of this size , it &apos;s worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
those people came to hear , that never had never found out , and to recognise that people who were often seen as monsters , even people with beautiful feelings , who were shot due to their habitats and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality , in which the country lives , does not exist .
but it tr@@ ro@@ asted me that all people - who have killed , and so much damage , we could bring to us a smile and a smile can give us a smile .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , following letter :
Kolum@@ bi@@ an@@ ern was done that after the drainage of the storm .
but this is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always give people to attack weapons which are ready to attack the weapons , and allow for their rights to protest their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we run from the F@@ ARC on the peace , to a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all the defence of peace to - regardless of the race , religion , or ideology , all of which belong to all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word to make our post and bring victim , as we know from own experience that nothing is simple . among those who defend the life as the basis of existence , many trouble will be forthcoming .
on our way we will give many obstacles , but we will overcome them .

it follows the translation of an article that was written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ owa , and its first published on the website OC Media took place .
homosexu@@ als and que@@ ere people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - such as discrimination , physical and sexual violence and pressing .
with terror , activists of the reporting of the last months over the persecution of men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , like a D@@ amo@@ is worth it depends on the LG@@ BT@@ Q assembly , is not only created by night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who gave some of their experiences with us and has spoken to us what is currently happening in the republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q &apos;s legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya obtained several months before the international head@@ lines , after reports were published , torture and murder of que@@ ens men in the republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ an@@ ina in Now@@ ak Gas@@ eta ; they cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the suspected men of men , and they sent secret pris@@ ons at secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
you have launched a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood , it felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was growing , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not safe place for it , which was why she moved to Moscow .
the hunt for Sab@@ rina , after a group of sex , had experienced the hunt to Sab@@ rina .
from fear of her life , she moved the final of the USA in the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I was active as a volunteer hel@@ per in human rights organisation .
one day was told me that someone was my help .
it was a acquain@@ t@@ ances from Da@@ gest@@ an , a cross @-@ woman , in trouble .
she had no money , so I took it without hes@@ itation .
while I was trying to help me , a copy of my documents and spread everywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , which can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
afterwards , the photos from my documents through all W@@ hat@@ s@@ app took the round .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was just trying to get a few gro@@ unded by the back seat of my car , I heard a mighty man &apos;s friend : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I left me , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing else .
then I heard a set , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; as long as you will have the family yet , thou sh@@ and@@ fle@@ ck ? &quot;
I knew the person .
I only know that it was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and the final end of the hospital in the hospital again .
apparently , some women had got everything together and started .
the man was fled .
women had called a nurse .
in the hospital I learned that I had two samples in my right lung wings .
OC Media : in which nurse were laid out - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , as there is still my male name , but the doctor stood , and put me to women .
I am grat@@ eful to him very grat@@ eful .
when I read his name for the first time at his Bür@@ ot@@ ür , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ cas@@ us name .
but it turned out to be a good man out .
I am grat@@ eful to him that he has gone full of me with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February , I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ ger , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
the short@@ fall , to send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that everything was a lie .
they wanted to prove that I wanted to prove it out , by the streets of the streets , and others wanted to say that I have not changed in the official Television in Gro@@ z@@ ny and I say that I was not the same message , that everything was only Schle@@ cht@@ ing , and Photos@@ hop .
I have Kör@@ b@@ chen@@ size C - what would I say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family tries to move with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still difficult for them .
some older people spoke to my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the whole republic .
we can &apos;t stir in , because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and laid down a kn@@ ck to the neck .
fortunately the neighbours and ret@@ ali@@ es were the neighbours .
at the time I had to change several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the windows , a car with dark@@ ened glass windows and a number@@ ing plate with 95 on the window .
after it happened to the third time , I was clear that there was something that was la@@ zy .
my human rights activists , the number@@ ing of the number@@ ing - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how are you fled ?
Sab@@ rina : with the aid of activists .
out of safety reasons I want to give her name to me , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with its help , I left the country , but then a little un@@ believ@@ able .
I still cannot realize how it was able to realize .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SI@@ M card to my mother if I arrived .
I bought it , without meeting , without ID , without blocking , without everything .
I broke my old SI@@ M card and took it into the gar@@ bage .
came to and check@@ ed into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stran@@ ger .
I plug the SI@@ M card in my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother per W@@ hat@@ s@@ app , I got a message : &quot; you would like to say good@@ bye to security , just because you have left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you know . you know even your room number .
only to prove it : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still contact your family in contact ?
Sab@@ rina : just with my mother and my sisters .
however , we speak about the inter@@ course of sexual inter@@ course , but not the table is subject to Tab@@ u@@ ary .
some traditionally Cau@@ cas@@ us elements are still in me .
so much I wish I wish to overcome this spiritual barrier , I can &apos;t be overcome .
I believe that as long as my mother &apos;s life is , I will do my best to do it .
when we do with the camera , I give me good effort to look like the person I remember from their past - i.e. , to my male form .
but that &apos;s very hard .
OC Media : know something about the present location in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for whom I had recent information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke with somebody there , one and a half month in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during the Ram@@ adan did not be arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he finished a new shaft .
most likely they will concentrate on the family and relatives .
so , my me , it is probably the relatives of relatives , that take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end of demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; by blood Gen@@ ug@@ tu@@ ung .
OC Media : are now also pregnant men in this secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of me says , it was just very many .
if , above all those who have no longer have relatives or the relatives of their relatives have been left to place the Kad@@ y@@ row court .
as far as I know they are held there , so they can present them as a terrorist .
say , &quot; You should be brought to them , &quot; You will show your body in television and claim that they would have not attacked your village or a military base .
understand ?
when these people , these people would not have gone , but targeted to radi@@ k@@ alizing .
OC Media : is now only a ver@@ ge or have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just had to meet someone who was a half and a half month in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people had disappeared at this prison after her b@@ art had grown .
there has been nothing new of them ever since .
they simply have taken you .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself taken when these people were taken .
however , until now , they were not presented as a band that there was so far no reports . we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible .
why otherwise you would not allow to shave these people ?
do you know , whether these tra@@ ce@@ ans and demonstrations of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I wrote my hair as long as long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had Bob .
I think that in 2003 I was already known in the great ny when I lived there - and I never had any problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sch@@ aria , I had never problems .
on the contrary , it was much more saf@@ er than now .
Russia wanted to take us to the &quot; civi@@ liz@@ ations , &quot; we finally came to us into the stone &apos;s stone .
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were exhau@@ sted ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wearing a little t@@ ops .
the Security Department of the Sch@@ aria has never found a hair with a hair .
ahead of the Russian Theater in Gro@@ z@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , a whole group of people met for me .
it was a small place where several banks were stood , and the whole city knew of them ; they knew why males , young people met .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a Rede@@ be@@ on : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ otte not over the evil of another . &quot;
one says it often to children , if that have fun across the crane .
OC Media : so they simply have closed their eyes in front of you , because they believed , you are sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
you never regre@@ ts me , never ge@@ aring and never defeated .
OC Media : how long he kept this grace of grace ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row appeared on the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak in TV via Mor@@ al .
he didn &apos;t spoke about us by se , but also priority about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - we could see how people in the city began to change themselves .
who had to gel@@ elt and had eight , looked up upon once with Ar@@ g@@ w@@ ohn .
during the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time , when I came back home , I could see how the situation in the Republic has steadily swal@@ low .
OC Media : what is going to go right now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as cell@@ ars .
I did not have much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much too much in the USA .
besides , I still worked as an activist .
currently I have been responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communic@@ ated with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we perfectly organize te@@ et@@ ching , con@@ spic@@ uous , I beg@@ ging them to the hospital and hel@@ fe them to get there cards .
I don &apos;t have any cents .
I have discovered this man himself , when I for@@ s@@ essed to se@@ al@@ per@@ te .
I &apos;m Muslims and want to help people who need help .
OC Media : bear a hi@@ j@@ ess ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ erts .
so the nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to make you with foam before the mouth that there is no oscill@@ ating with them .
the da@@ em@@ ans who have the cab@@ ard@@ iner that have the Russians also ; on the planet there are they - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I &apos;m from there , that is why it &apos;s un@@ pleasant , to listen to me .
I did so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go into the mosque and during the Ram@@ adan - live with men together .
know , many remember with Tran@@ si@@ es of men , men love , and they believe that man might be a family to make more intimate experience . but that &apos;s a Tru@@ g@@ ation .
that are two different things - two different types of the sens@@ ory , in order to be exactly what different settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin , and do not feel me for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry that I would like to personally I personally , but my last in@@ time relationship is now longer than a year .
and I haven &apos;t sad why - I just know that I am now I am .
local groups in front of an increase in self @-@ po@@ den within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high labor and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
for the last months , there has a strong increase in self @-@ mor@@ nings since the last months .
the picture of the Arab worker in Iran was made by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran , is characterized by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Bay of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered under anxiety and depression , and he inherited for his own help of people , who would like to work out for his family , as Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights groups , who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anonymous .
one on YouTube video , the moments he held himself , after he had held himself .
some people made it quickly to er@@ ase the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the combustion engines had so strong that the doctors could no longer do .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority in August , and activists before the place warned that , even more men could take the life .
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month several other - H@@ amid Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Say@@ yed Fal@@ ah Mou@@ ss@@ avi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tami@@ m .
their stories have a thing in common : it was all of the fathers fathers , which , due to the persecution of the Iranian government , hil@@ ates and un@@ de@@ able to feed their families and work on a secure work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is located in the majority of the Iran @-@ living Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community , was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to make their life to the native Arab population .
in front of a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was one of the autonomous region of Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took power in 1925 , and in 1925 , the ethnic autonomy began to end up with Iran .
in Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the biggest in the next oil and gas fields as well as some of the most frequent and most valuable tips for the Iranian farming .
despite this valuable resources , the regional economy continues only slowly , and the native population receives only little from this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and relaxation .
the Iranian regime refused to produce the Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ Ara@@ bians work@@ stations in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also has a variety of roofs , built water from the Arab areas in the Persian territories , where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om are running .
these dam@@ s have only led to destroy which in the region , caused by dry conditions , as well as local agriculture as well as the fish and palm trees to destroy .
the unemployment rate below the Arab Jama@@ w@@ zi @-@ adolescents rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general manager for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , revealed that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who finished elementary school , 55 % of the leading school finished , and 45 % have completed a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... that targets to destroy the spirit of national resistance . &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights activist in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; a &quot; high @-@ rise &quot; number of self @-@ mor@@ alist among the young Ah@@ w@@ azi men .
Do@@ him@@ i said that particularly the unemployment has become more serious . the reason for this , a combination of a high number of Ah@@ wa@@ z has newly diagnosed ethnic cleansing and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since functioning and institutions do not adjust the Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi becomes access to working opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic political policy of the dominant regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs in order to destroy their lives outside of the home of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to hide their preferences in the ancest@@ or to the ancest@@ ry , and to hide them , as even the Arabic name will not be toler@@ ated , because the speaking of the Arab language or the Tra@@ ce of Arabic clothing .
in view of the given circumstances which have to bear the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi , the Human Rights of Human Rights , before the situation is explosive .
it remains to wait to wait for the world of w@@ aking up and knowledge of them .

the following article is a revised version of the opinion that was written by A@@ yo@@ mide , and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject to several discussions , where many different positions came on .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I don &apos;t have a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as an interactive fem@@ ini@@ zed fem@@ ini@@ sts - with Fr@@ ust .
you wonder@@ s , why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay well thought @-@ thought @-@ thought and social arguments before me , why I would be femin@@ ist and why we should be in general the femin@@ ist * .
for example , women are still selling less money in spite of the same education .
that women are still under strict observation , if that &apos;s why they may need to make it with their body .
violence against women a global epide@@ mic is .
or that cultural and social standards do not ensure that women , or later , in various areas of life , will encounter a gl@@ am@@ ser@@ ne blanket , and that discrimination due to gender , are still moving across the many different countries and faith .
all this is aware and known .
I am among them and I have twice double and thre@@ e@@ fold , among them .
I am a black woman .
and nonetheless , if I suffer from skin to skin , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community ; if I mentioned one , like that of which we were physically challenged , a lack of femin@@ ist and non @-@ verb@@ al movement , many white fem@@ ini@@ sts and white internal fem@@ ini@@ zed fem@@ ini@@ sts were destroyed .
however , however , all the agree that women - are coming together to take away &quot; their voices and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &quot; to sing the equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about sexu@@ alized violence is a institutional design , that we are exposed to black women on two times .
or about that , black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and country of origin less than the white men and women .
the black girl and girls are threatened with a migration background of the school as the white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women are exposed in black spots and women with a migration background to be exposed to higher risk of domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women .
on the one hand , I want to connect all men , all men and all men . on the other hand , I can connect me as a black woman to take part in their heart , that ref@@ uses to take into account the sake of sex as well as to the skin colour of a person .
I &apos;m afraid , and I don &apos;t forget to fight my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist , which always fight me and numerous other black women and ever rejected .
So@@ jour@@ ner passed away in 1851 in her speech : &quot; I don &apos;t have any woman ? &quot; and I refused me to get a ideology , in which the black woman is a human beings , a human beings , and mar@@ gin@@ ally .
I wanted me to join me at group@@ ings , which also absor@@ bing a seat to the cultural events of our seat and customs , to form their eg@@ o@@ centric program .
I will not try to try white women the importance of the over@@ clock of skin colour and gender . some of them will continue to try black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to try out a recovery .
although the inter@@ mitt@@ al femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women from different ways to give women from the white femin@@ ism , and is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I am going to join me of femin@@ ism and join me of femin@@ ism to join me and my status as a woman , rather than me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ ma , that is hard to say that Inter@@ sek@@ ality is being celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before , we define black women to define our own ideas and put us into the split , which are made from us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , says : Rec@@ la@@ iming O@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can do it ) , in which they are absolutely safe and in which the cultural , mental , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be consumed in which the black woman account .
although some white and internal fem@@ ini@@ zed fem@@ ini@@ sts , Separ@@ atism and exclusion may be read that these lines are read about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradi@@ ctions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in this para@@ dig@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this para@@ dig@@ m .
I am recognized due to my dark skin , due to my life , as part of this para@@ dig@@ mas .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment , in which my life does not translate , nor will be ignored .
p@@ aus@@ nd against the pollution : the mission of a man who protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations .
this entry of To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a@@ .com , a magazine , which reports about international efforts to meet environmental problems .
as part of an content @-@ sharing agreement , this article is again published here .
in the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ render or in can@@ oe - with a special concerns by the Kurdistan Regional Court . his mission aims to make people the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of Emi@@ ly Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of the pollution at its community .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river , which we lost when I was still a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a .
scientists from all the country are fear that the decades of the war , the construction of dust , the pollution , and the un@@ ly@@ rical development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation water@@ ke@@ epers when it works and works , &quot; the rivers , bro@@ oks and water routes in Iraq as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of this natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a Mus@@ a sm@@ el@@ iness and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we have no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia von Emi@@ ly Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary filmmaker , based in Iraq and multi@@ medi@@ al journ@@ alism , produced and produced .

the following item is the short@@ ened and modified version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of Kur@@ tur@@ ally . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ er Mu@@ j@@ er ( # Nu@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ ull ) which was reported over the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to the protection of the affected people .
a police force said , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she had nothing to have been forci@@ ble against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , its chief partner who has become a violent company .
since the end of its relationship , a little time have passed and the police said to become the acts of the acts , but more could not do it .
as a further woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena was found because of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , useful even the acute display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez .
a few days later , the second wife moved their ad back .
the Teu@@ fel@@ den Prize of violence against women , is difficult .
if women spend at once more ad , they do not receive any support from the Sta@@ ats .
in many cases , women are also dependent on the men depending on it . this explains why only 20 % of women who admit the victims of violence should be victims of violence against the victims of violence .
cont@@ ent@@ s@@ 1 stro@@ kes and Statisti@@ cs 2 Un@@ visible missions and a legal system , which is nothing inferior to ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 metabolic laws : good approach , lack of stro@@ kes and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women are really mis@@ use , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various data and reports that are not even ans@@ at@@ ly ise the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the numbers are al@@ ar@@ able , however .
in 2015 , in the district At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s Office 9@@ 600 displays because of domestic violence . at 70 % of them , violence against women .
86 % of the advertisements in the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 new ads because of domestic violence in the peace . here , 86 % of the advertisements came from women .
in the ads , 40 % of women that they were physically challenged , 55 % of women responded by psych@@ ic mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
this statistics show , however , does not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ res are actually shown just a few of these criminal in Paraguay . &quot; every woman who will be ref@@ und@@ able in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , come 9 women who do not do .
on any woman who will be ref@@ und@@ able for physical missions , come two women who do not do , &quot; says it end of 2014 .
because women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a own way , the criminal authorities can not be adequate , as many women every year are murdered by their current or former partners .
between August and August 2016 , journalists showed at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days died a woman due to violence .

invisible missions and a legal system , which falls nothing .
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she was named after all of their former friends .
at the beginning she wanted to do not yet , but then but after . this should always be for getting worse .
today , Mari@@ ana 28 years old and not more with Carlos together . but for two years , the psych@@ ic violence on the one hand , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe forms of violence against women .
I have never thought that I would have been victims of missions .
when I have read more , I thought that only women happened to sub@@ si@@ zable , because they leave by violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana took social media to report about the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions to Facebook , in which they described his opposition and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told them that it had isolated from them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked him , whether he ever made his hand against it and refused , that his behavior was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen in such a long time of Carlos , and it wasn &apos;t earlier .
it seemed almost so when they wanted to say that victims of missions have at least a certain fellow @-@ school .
Victoria Santos , who does not come from Paraguay , fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner did it har@@ assed .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o Cre@@ o ( &quot; I think you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way of missions .
in the group , they can speak with other over her experience , listen to each other , and support each other .
you do this what many others do not do : take the testimony of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as &apos;s case everything started with psych@@ ic mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
their prosper@@ ous partners may even be able to convince them that she was valuable .
then he began to beat them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as Advertis@@ ements were no support with the authorities and even from their relatives , she did not support their relatives .
it led to a trial against their former partner who developed into an unmistak@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her homeland , in which it was mainly money , power and influence of their former Partners .
g@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws , which are very well , but not used .
the ad of missions is a way full of resistance and a struggle against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organization for women in Paraguay , also looks great problems with the application of the laws in the country .
on August 10 , 2016 , in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , a bill that was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ E@@ llas ( # Für@@ y ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign based on Twitter that supported by Amnesty International .
the original design of the law looks forward to explain Fe@@ mi@@ cide on a stand @-@ standing shi@@ fted to explain and harder , as it was already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
in some points the legislative text was changed in some points , by also the ME@@ Ps for the law that would be afraid that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions , which currently are forbidden in Paraguay are forbidden in Paraguay up to five years .
the original bill had provided that the majority of the ( bureaucra@@ tic and economic ) process costs , which have to carry out the victim of violence , even if they simply fit only display and receive a safe accommodation in the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective , if the legis@@ lature does not give enough financial funding for this purpose :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment was seen as a part of human resources .
here , a revolution must take place , so that violence is no longer regarded as anything Nor@@ mal .
who , in view of these facts , he is found guilty and carries out that the perpet@@ rators &quot; perpet@@ rators are coming . &quot;
we have to out@@ fit so long display , until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer regarded as normal .
on November 10 , 2016 , the law was adopted at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law have been changed . among other things , a passage in cases which had called for the partner in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions about the changes are going on .
the Section on the reconciliation was again seen as an opportunity for the Ag@@ gress@@ or to attack his victims .
the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence , &quot; and &quot; sexual exploitation of &quot; parts of the law , however , is considered a big retreat .

independent media in Oman have been exposed to the ban on a newspaper in Oman .
&quot; this website was locked to read on the website of the banned newspaper A@@ am@@ n &quot; on the website of the banned journal Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
more than one year ago , the om@@ an authorities have signed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper A@@ am@@ n for their coverage of corruption in the Sult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be imprisoned in prison where he served one year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri were also arrested and transferred to court , but later was returned to court .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had passed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur by a state of state .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important branches in the country : Prime Minister , Defense Minister , Deputy Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Defense , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sult@@ ans of the Sult@@ ans is characterized by the har@@ assed efforts of security forces , in particular freedom of freedom , including freedom of freedom , and human rights activists , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists .
the authorities seek peaceful and legi@@ time activities in the field of human rights , activists , activists who have beli@@ efs about the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online as well as offline free .
the attack on the Newsp@@ aper Az@@ am@@ n , her closure and the appeal of three of their editors in the last year is a hard hit for freedom of freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on corruption in Oman ( a absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , was published in the newspaper on July 26th , 2016 . in this it was made by corruption in the alignment and the composition of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .

the paper was closed down on un@@ certain period after the information Minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and dissem@@ ination of the newspaper on any way , including online on August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , before the Court of Mask@@ at the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri was held .
the court sentenced three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .

medical research in Africa : chances and under@@ stand@@ able
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , image took place with his friends
medical research in Africa is only rarely or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that are addressed to the urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the demand on site @-@ run medical research , there are two reasons : for one of the benefits of global health , many medicines and vacc@@ ines which cover the particular medical needs on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , Tuber@@ culo@@ sis and malaria in the poo@@ rest countries in Africa , more than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the exploration of these diseases are a great problem .
secondly , research , which is carried out by African scientists himself in Africa . a larger role of science and technology can only be promoting the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Research ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s at Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic was the first serious effects on the national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doct@@ oral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself worked on the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the most effective healthcare system .
in Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and over abnorm@@ alities of the media about this research .
( Dis@@ cla@@ ves : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . supporting the most important national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just star@@ ed a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the important scientific science topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they distinguish themselves from those in western countries ?
R@@ W : there is no basic research here . we are only available solutions that wo@@ unds the wo@@ unds .
that must change , otherwise we will always remain the receiver , instead of them to be M@@ acher .
the solutions , which we get , are often used in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
g@@ v : where does the financing and support ?
is she sufficient ?
how simple or hard , it &apos;s suitable to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
R@@ W : from the United States and Europe .
projects are different well @-@ funded .
it &apos;s hard to find people who come back or back here , for financing and development chances are better than in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are available in your routine research work , which had not previously had previously ?
R@@ W : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries . it costs plenty of money , continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it lasts months to import it from other countries .
g@@ v : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
R@@ W : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools in order to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , which should concentrate on and how can we support the development ?
R@@ W : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there are necessary to special scientific training , starting at each age .
social sciences , computer sciences , Big Data , exploration of space , the healthcare sector ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and increasing diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will be benef@@ iting from it .
g@@ v : you can describe the advance and cons of life as a scientist in Africa over Western countries , based on your experience ?
R@@ W : often there are the limited speed , things to do , and the values have access to scientific expertise , which are here challenges .
the system , that magazines are only accessible to payment for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , limited also the amount of available information and speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers will change global food production .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this entry of Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky appeared on the website En@@ si@@ a@@ .com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on bred back in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ der , the first plant , which is by NASA astron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been consumed .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was only created by his own random number and the question how many sal@@ aries can get borders , limits .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he observed that more Sal@@ ate was patented and that he could not use them for the bre@@ edings .
the patents are not only available for individual varieties , but also for specific characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special rot@@ or green or green leaves .
over the past years , more such patents have been registered to more plants such as cer@@ eal or anti @-@ fleet varieties . because of this trends , plant breeding , environmental cont@@ actors , and experts for food security around the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia tradition , Mort@@ on was still salad , he needs now to be more than ever since its work is always getting worse .
&quot; it is when one would lie in a river a rock bro@@ cks , to whom I have sho@@ cked .
so we must now do that , but it is a split with the breeding tradition , &quot; says he says . &quot; I think these patents have to go far too far .
and when they hold a court , no one can stick to a new sal@@ at@@ titudes , because all features already patented &quot; . so he &apos;s so good as possible , and tries to talk about the characteristics that he wants .
however , it is very careful and easy to use , not a material which is protected as a intellectual property .
in addition , he is connected to a motion , which is always larger in the USA and anywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; bre@@ edings ) .
astron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS , red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the variety of Out@@ red@@ der in the &quot; greenhouse project &quot; the station bred and eaten there . there is also tested whether plants in space can be produced .

it is no coincidence that this name is more so sounds as the movement would come from the IT sector , and not from the range of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software and insp@@ ects the alternatives to ur@@ he@@ ber@@ legally protected software .
it was launched to life in order to ensure that some species of plant and species are not being protected by intellectual property , and so be used for plant breeding .
in the framework of the initiative , shortly O@@ ssi , US bre@@ eder can commit themselves to use that others can be used by them bred seeds .
it does not mean that they can do not make shops with their seed and sell it . &quot; Open source &quot; bre@@ eder allow to buy it to cross the seed , so it &apos;s not immediately le@@ es - two aspects that are banned by many plant species .
dozens of bre@@ eder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
dunes :
Professor Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , a member of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ssi @-@ board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , are important for food safety and environmental protection .
seeds plays a role in larger co@@ ats , such as biodiversity , rights of peasants , control over the nutritional system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eder would try to use last but not only use little to use the seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; Open Source &quot; movement is not employed with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all types of plants could be patented in order to achieve the presence of environmental sustainability in the global agricultural industry , but in August or September 2016 , we would like to buy food and sustainable vegetables as well as farmers , should also know that the way is far@@ med up like this vegetables is cultivated .
nutritional values no seed is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative do not commit their seed to provide for their seed . hence , her approach is patented in contrast , seed and plant characteristics .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ssi supporters argued that the future of food supply are endangered because the prize pool to be caused by the ever @-@ to @-@ use mental property rights to plant material , which is therefore likely to be restricted .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , the Director of O@@ ssi , has found himself in her PhD thesis with gen@@ eti@@ scher &apos;s variation in car@@ rots and its availability . it found that about one @-@ third of all anti@@ trust characteristics are protected as a intellectual property , so it &apos;s either for plant breeding , or not only useful .
for other plants , there are such estimates are not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suggests that mass@@ aging plants such as wheat in still larger style is patented as salad or car@@ rots .
a question of visibility
plants are so bred that they have targeted further features - from such that their taste or their color improves up to such , due to those they thri@@ ves in certain environments and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eder is increasing due to more patents . genetic diversity currently , however , would be much worse than ever before , as the changed conditions are much worse by climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to , that genetic diversity can be important and decisive for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture in the United States , the company is responsible for the preservation of genetic diversity .
however , she says , however , is the view that the intellectual property others promote &quot; patents and &quot; patents and the protection of crop protection products . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow , as soon as the patent is carried out .
often help this instructions , with another method to come to the same result .
such a protection inhi@@ bit innovations not , but promotes them by the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees the different : 20 years to wait until a patent , which certainly does not need any innovation .
and if you have to wait for a long time to use plants that are to be adapted to the changed environmental conditions , they have lost the battle already .
the main source for Mort@@ on is but that genetic resource has already been involved in general , and to continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeding , neither the time still remain the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ aries are not attractive for us .
we want to make farmers their work .
this is what we desire , and it &apos;s impossible for us , if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resource . &quot;
a total of interference from Mort@@ on on the concept to patented plant features : &quot; we are creating the characteristics not really .
the plants constitute them out of and as bre@@ eder , we finally have no idea how to do the plants .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding , in the US state of Oregon and O@@ ssi @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who bred a variety of species , bred his own values in it .
those who believes to the industrial agriculture with great hum@@ or and mon@@ ocular cultures , in which cultivation approach her@@ b@@ ici@@ des are needed , who sh@@ uts into its varieties of agriculture .
my concept is precisely ge@@ ared . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are in international markets , but smaller than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents have to survive the most smaller seed companies , even without patents they reject them , or they hold it for expensive and therefore not worth@@ while , or both are the case .

Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eder is pat@@ ron@@ ed by plant pat@@ ent innovative : &quot; it looks like that I was able to produce new efforts to produce new , more than companies that patented .
I need to do a new material for my catalog , because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is 20 years before the competition , to make it very easy . &quot; worldwide Reson@@ ance
although the United States seem to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept is spread over the whole world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes itself as a professional organization in the field of traditional food@@ stuffs , along with farmers and helps to meet new varieties to kill certain varieties .
it also supports it , to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed and sell their own .
the German organisation has been working on an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; license which ultimately gave a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ssi @-@ commitment to the European Union .
regulations concerning the bre@@ edings differ from the country , such as the O@@ ssi @-@ commitment is not easy to be taken to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive Committee of the European Union , the European Commission declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . thus , she speaks against the present practice of the European Patent , the patents have been bred on conventional plants .
however , an explanation is not a law , but it is now to bring it to the governments of the Member States , to protect these new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; by representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and global trend towards the Pat@@ tern of Saat@@ tue .
Willy Dou@@ ma , Head of Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; Open source &quot; seed systems explains that the organisation currently is a global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems building , which will be the planned next year of the official start .
a merger of environmental protection and development aid ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , international non @-@ profit organization Group , technology and concentration - action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food and other - published a report . it represents the view that farmers will need to improve on seed and improve the seed policy , thus making a stable supply of food .
in the report , the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems is stressed - a context , from the Lu@@ by von O@@ ssi will hope that they will recognize that more people will be recogni@@ zable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has barely seen above all , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to participate in the people that even more behind their foods . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are latest targets of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
still un@@ locking the Egyptian authorities in the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government passed the web site of the network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documented human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt as well as the Arab world .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , which critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step , critic@@ ised the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the &apos; Network for Human Rights Information - despite this encour@@ agement to defend the law in this part of the law , so it &apos;s never so important to do so . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are exhau@@ sted all of the people to overcome the Sper@@ ing and do not work . we are looking forward to meet our task to meet our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered to block the first web site of human rights organization in Egypt , as the independent news magazine M@@ ada Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar , Qatar , called Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is also no access to Egypt &apos;s blog of the column and human rights activists Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no access in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of Kolum@@ ba and articles which he is not accessible for Egypt in Egypt .
now the blog , he set up in order to avoid the Z@@ ens@@ ur@@ sor of the Egyptian government to avoid the aim of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider of which also native to Zi@@ adas blog , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he participated in the student protests and a video , as the police officers attempted against two students .
his article turn mainly on politics and human rights conditions in Egypt .
in a Facebook review , Zi@@ ada left the sper@@ m through the government and reflect what this means :
the blo@@ gs that blo@@ gs is very old , however , has been priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi . and even if the locks of blo@@ gs might not be significant for the world , it &apos;s not for two reasons for me :
1 ) There &apos;s them to give me the feeling of an siege to communicate ; a arrest , a dis@@ covering murder , sum@@ mons at the national Security Council , the sper@@ m blo@@ gs , and any other web page , for whom I worked .
2 ) They have proved that I did not plan for free . in other words , my words have the influence , if only for a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it for the item of articles to feed the c@@ ens@@ orship .
now , after they have locked him , and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or a second blog .
the mu@@ e@@ go down the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and expression ( AF@@ TE ) the Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests in the network of different Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , amongst others orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and Eti@@ sal@@ at .
AF@@ TE &apos;s documentation also shows the sper@@ m providers , by implementing an internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12th , we were able to offer how the sper@@ m Web pages , that began to offer V@@ PN@@ s .
such practice shows that the government of the government , continues to block content , and to filters , on the Egyptian users could have access to Egyptian users .
the situation , in addition , the situation will also be made behind closed doors behind closed doors , so the Egyptian population has no legal basis , using them to go against this acts against this acts .
now , the question : how far is the Egyptian government is ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship , and if they will be the next attack ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants are fighting .

quite a day of newspapers in Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city of the country and home to numerous posters were discussed .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
the 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot in school , &quot; E@@ vening &apos;s second day becomes a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; President Tem@@ ans sends out 8500 soldiers from the army , Marine and Air Force , according to Rio . &quot;
the economic wave in the middle of the economic crisis and in an established financial situation reached the highest level in 2017 in Rio for the past 10 years .
the Brazilian Non @-@ government organisation Global Justice , called even the United Nations .
reports how these are every day and this is acceptable to acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local paper .
so , published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio @-@ known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 , the article &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which they were able to set up a new section called &quot; war in Rio . &quot;
all reports about violence in the city are now published there .
in terms of decision , the paper explained the paper :
extra will continue to be reported on crimes reports which happen in each big city in the world , like the murder , Rau@@ b , sex , etc . Every@@ thing , which happens in Rio , will be published in the category &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our kind , to call : that &apos;s not normal !
this is the only alternative to which we do not close our eyes before the ridge .
in a four @-@ minute video that was divided on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper that this decision was no reason for pride , but rather a sign of the failure should be :
extra is probably the only newspaper to all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t even recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist announced that it will be controlled by the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territories that will be controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial article the newspaper continued :
we is aware that a war discre@@ et when he is broken , even if he can be broken , gr@@ aus@@ ing of the police , which only rule , and then ask questions , too .
but we defend the war on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners .
sch@@ a@@ det the name &quot; War &quot; more than they useful ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Brasil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira are argued to call violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is what about the media &apos;s legal security policy could cause the media and could draw up responsibilities at the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - including Extra with an analysis of military rates in Rio themselves - in combination with un@@ sufficient investments in personnel , education , and a historical and self @-@ balanced diet .

at the beginning , these actually resulted in a decrease of violent deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP would be in several reports about Schi@@ kan@@ es and repression against the poor commun@@ es which was actually protected by the newly created Police Unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux came from one of his article in 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio did not act as determined by the Geneva Convention and the term &quot; Civil War . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war is also serious consequences for people after themselves .
because this calls for the state , means and ways to make a war in the territory of a &quot; fine of the &quot; enemies in which a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and the object for &quot; Koll@@ ist damage &quot; and &quot; ver@@ ir@@ ated balls . &quot;

since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from gross siege and block@@ ades , mainly caused by the Assad regime .
according to victories , a common initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege .
especially strong affected the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta , where an attack against chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the life of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition go out , based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organizations that the massacre was committed by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , it has been controlled from the rebels @-@ controlled areas outside the siege of Damascus , which led to the fact that residents are produced on demand or by tunnels and control points .
through the years of block@@ age , traditional food and meat has become in@@ accessible for large parts of the population .
as an counter@@ act , a group of Syrian humanitarian services , acade@@ mics , and acade@@ mics from the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ ta , how they can use their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ food supply . &quot;
they call himself G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ near da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala by the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not among the traditional , in Syria , and are only very rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , they makes them about an attractive food source for many people from the besi@@ eged Ost G@@ hou@@ ta .
the Direc@@ tor@@ ate of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said across the French news agency AFP
&quot; we decided to have a high nutritional value of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , like meat , and because they can use them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reported global Vo@@ ices that has been fought for three years , this project was well known to do this project and impressive his relief from that it is well @-@ known for more and more . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , nut@@ ty in agreement with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ near da the humanitarian crowd control platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to con@@ vey 125 families to communicate with fung@@ i , as Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12.@@ 700 euros , but will continue to collect donations for Can@@ ons .
the initiative is involved in generators to keep temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity is 80 % .
because of the fuel that are used locally , the fuel imports made of plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said , Global Vo@@ ices said that they began with the &quot; production of the regions from the regions , before they saw her quality , and if they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when they succeeded , they used a bigger tub . and so on .
now they have designed an &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after further 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms anywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to bring the fung@@ al forms of different reasons . &quot; the siege of the siege . &quot;
providing a new food source in the market .
spread of a culture of self @-@ catering , by eating remains ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) to thread new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities , which are bound at home .
he said , &quot; we hope to spread this idea in the world , so our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege will be visible .
we want to help our experiences people in crisis areas are inspired and we can help humanity . &quot;

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , had been murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara made a sudden protection against the Taliban .
the Taliban , well @-@ known for their hate to the Haz@@ ara known Taliban are always closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan again .
a few years he worked in a co@@ her@@ ru@@ be . the work was heavy and made him ill .
then he took over what was from his low salary , and went in Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and drag saw with mort@@ ar which he@@ avier than he himself .
back then , as today , life @-@ Afghan refugees was min@@ ted by El@@ end and exploitation in Iran .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; reminded by A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an old building on the building site , where we also worked .
there were no services there and no heating . we were able nylon that open the open windows at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran behind and made himself ready for the trip to Europe .
