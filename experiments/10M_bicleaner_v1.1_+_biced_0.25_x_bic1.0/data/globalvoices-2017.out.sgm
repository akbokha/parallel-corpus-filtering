<seg id="1">Although I visited the U.S. since 2012 at least once a year, I would now living there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting.</seg>
<seg id="3">My dear to America is highly great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American films, I made American authors read and his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a very profound impact effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the grand Denzel Washington, a terrible reporter that covered with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura-student, who covered the top military tribunal of judges who had to occupy its interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "I was, when the absolute truth is, lackiss everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year, which I lived in Arizona, had only strengthened my help to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country, where I lived there, whose diversity is so welcoming, that you can always be that you're, and it's easy acceptance of a community of gender people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very good love story about its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the breasts and Racism this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The exceptional aspect of its ascension is for me, as he goes with his bottlenght in his face.</seg>
<seg id="15">It keeps with his mind never behind the mountain, as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he think, as a former colleague wanted to express his death for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-American and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people have reacted on his statements and shot himself in Schar for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes that he won at the Republican congressional elections, the highest number ever won by the party of the nominees.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speaking in English.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotte person, I asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was able to jump and his voters do not bring with the people in keeping that I had learned during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As of example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalist of journalism, people from all over the world, is a deep glassment of man, with whom I was able to keep in Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps met the Weltanschauung with Peter Bhatia, the present publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met us at our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to play the "Phoenix Suns" in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also on the contrast to the generosity that I am at Sandy Bahr, who fights for her life on the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me as their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even she fits to the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with patience and wormingly, and my colleagues helped us to peramperate to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people, and the help of they embodied values in America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While laced his way to the nominees of republican candidate, they offered myself a stop and the counterpart of its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the Presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his disregard against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The dispute with the idea that humans have failed because they distributed either his racism and fanatism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, I broke almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it's possible to designate the trump-voters as raassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">In one of my friends, one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectable and indicates an inability to understand those who want to act on a different kind of manner and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes will not be taken into account in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that this voters could have, of which most white are, for trump, because she would like to win over a country because she disappointed over a country?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they wanted to say they say that they are still important in this United States?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can't forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man, who looks back on those who look after those who look differently.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (c.): as much as "The White Against any other Ethics"; vocabulary of white in recording on the White and whiplash, as it was called the great Van Jones, exactly the killed what the America did so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world will appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - any faith or background you may have so much, America is to welcome you.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country has chosen as his President, twice the son of a Kenyaners, whose history as he says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with multiple, religious freedom and all the term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the America after 9 / 11 the white man will be back on the ruin that they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">At all, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a client for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the human quantity.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trent, my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The amount answered with a loud-strong "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"were Muslims in place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" hatches the amount.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they had called them and their voices were noisier.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone who doesn't matter how to make a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and strong "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan finished with the words: "God be thanks, Mr. Trump, is not your America." 36 hours later he was correct.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all people who look like Mr. Khan, could no place in this new America in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of Vicente Guerrero municipality located in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguan town Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That music, which is played on both sites, not only the life of the children has changed, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, which lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a big landfill, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; one of the old colonial city, which is very popular among tourists, but turns away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now, La banda de MÃºsica (Music bande) is now working in the municipality: a children and adults of existing symphony orchestra that has found a possibility to overflow the surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is well known for their drug abuse and violence violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this did not change this after a random meeting with a French pilots who started a musical project, and the Youth did a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from the school, they go back home and immediately after lunch running they race through the well-known roads to go to their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come back and play with shiny eyes and play in the Trubel you can learn day for trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos, and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village which is practically above the largest waste landfill of AsunciÃ³n in the capital city - on instruments that are made from renewable waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with repeated instruments, made of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling under Favio ChÃ¡vez began to turn samples of departure into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments were produced by spirits, broods, Celli, contrasts, guitars, fledged, saxophone, trumpet, trombone and percussion, which were all produced from the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music, and music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez remembers a local enologist and musicians of the children of Cateura, on the starting point:</seg>
<seg id="87">First, it was very difficult because we had no space for rehearsal and we had to place at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage. children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something that he had never seen before: a waste made of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a complete orchestra that plays on instruments from all instruments and is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill haRmonic" (Harmonic garland) draws on the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tonnes of trash each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill haRmonic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra also played his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">Those East African countries show how technology and team work successfully combat illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing was fought.</seg>
<seg id="98">This entry, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published in Ensia.com, a magazine that targets international, practising solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication occurs in the context of an agreement with Global Voices for joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa was then known that this ship had already been operated in Liberian waters of illegal fishing and sought the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The Eastern African countries were up against this, and little genotyping, a bill of this kind to welcome their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the compressors, Mozambique, and the Seychelles mobilized itself against the ship. they refused to teach, one of its harbours, and refused to use a fishing in a fisheries.</seg>
<seg id="103">Suddenly, the prime minister of the country was surrounded by country, the Benedict Kiilu, a senior executive of the Kenyan Fisheries authorities. he is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed.</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was sold out from the waters of the region: it was not succeeded to catch up there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia, because of plundering of fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, the criminal practices and resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fishstop).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are next to Somalia and Madagascar who had six countries that had been displaced from their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are able to work together with them." she says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable project Ending Illegal project Ending Illegal. this project offers FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition, is hidden because it is extremely difficult for it. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfish from regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By deliberate abnormalities of existing laws, using which certain habitats and species are protected, the illegal fishing ecosystem damage, which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing have been committed by bureaucratic against illegal fishing and also through the Schneckentempo, with the information between individual countries, and the traceable actions will present in real time, traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, individual countries with each other for example, lists an existing licenses, news to suspected activities or details, which had noticed during a harbour inspection or learn.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursued the activities of ships also very much, when they move at the open sea, using satellite towers.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows to meet the authorities to meet ships which are found in verbotted areas, too - about such that indicate that a ship passes away from fish to other ships on other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the idea of ideas, such investigations show whether the participating ships have a fishery license, where they were on the way, and possibly whether they have a straster.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing in their ports. what means that ships will not sell their cargo ships in their ports. so that the ships could not sell their cargo will not be forced to be forced, as in case of Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it's then significant financial losses for the owners, which means the illegal fishing catfish are not worth it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, head director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a Beratercompany that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">Closed front.</seg>
<seg id="120">The already-called platform was created to win approximately 20 million USD to lost sales by estimated 20 million US dollars, which lose the eight members of the HISH network every year because of illegal fishermen, penetrating in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish plants, and is essential because of the region of commercial fish from all over the world. also, those of illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices, such as sailing under falsitic flag, fake license paper, indication of Phantasienames, fishings protected species and fishing in the nature reserve.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "you want to use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-wing control system" "" "says Long." "", a ship was illegally illegal and a country could not say "" "" You are not running my harbour. "" "</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Komm to me'. "and exactly this legale canyon tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception FISH-i participated in more than 30 investigations to have been involved in more than 30 investigations.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has been criminal networks to spread the fake licenses in Tanzania. discovered ships that used several mourn identities and were found fleeing ships and were found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Based on his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for crimes committed, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing through large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations perform rather far into the networks" "", "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system, the FISH-i can help to help ships to be more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always further developed, helps to hide the illegal ships.</seg>
<seg id="133">The illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. "and we try to cross the cross," says Duncan Copeland, editor at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NRO, which also offers fisheries data and the FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off for example, for example, your automatic identification systems, which they cannot be taken from satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build up a system that links various information technology with each other. it is supposed to help fly with more precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">Yet FISH-i's Team African nations have indeed influence the influence of global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth - with Google and the marine conservation organization Oceana, opened the platform Global Fishing Watch, offers a platform to satellite satellite system, and with which the position can be viewed every single traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">In fact, with the neighbours to get a better picture above, he who does - that's just meaning, "he says," he says. "here is a chance for countries to combine and join their resources on the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="141">We should do this on a global level. "Pew Charitable Trusts, we should run a similar project, which is a global system for the persecution of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There are indications that FISH-i's activities are not only weakened, but it also shopper.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that socks earlier without license, hardly with consequences, know that it will be observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the participating in FISH-i participating countries now accounted for a 33% increase in fisheries, since fishing boats more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH fair in Somalia, Greko 1 showed up doors, the inspectors found on board tows, whose use is forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries will notice this successes. "the effect is strongly that us also have other countries," says Kiilu. "we have become a study objective." in West Africa disappear several hundred million dollars annually by illegal fishing annually.</seg>
<seg id="148">There will be six countries together, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. even they fight the illegal fishing trade according to the same model such as FISH-i. e. "This is the goal of let, even more such initiatives, and structures can be used in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's younger member states had his first major triumph: in October, Greko 1, a ship which was on the wrong flag. and not only was the ship without a license and have been used, which now has been prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also still in served waters which are reserved for fisherman from Somalia. 'with the nephew of measures against Greko 1, they put a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing-fishing, "says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time, proof that a special, collaborative work on the oceans is actually working throughout the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London. she writes about the environment, technology and nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="152">Her article appear in the Wired Magazine, TED Education, New York Times, and the Guardian. situation in Venezuela has become more: demonstrations in several cities with the aim of bringing "the country"</seg>
<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela has to seem only the beginning of a wave of hard demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They apply to a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum to stop NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of MarÃ­a Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government postponed the application of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum, reacted the Venetians, in whose eyes had been running the negotiations on the political and economic crisis in the country, where they gathered together on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the return of Venezuela) can be found both images from these demonstrations and arguments against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also led in other parts of the country - including in the Flachland area Barinas, in the central area MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the central North of Bundesturat Carabobo and at the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Eparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation deteriorated continuously, in the everyday life of the Venetians, through an acute lack of food and drugs.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the Opposition saw in the tenment of the current President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, the chance to a fundamental change; however, the reluctance was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, co-acting at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in their latest article in the context of the government's context:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, which is the highest in the world (inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and that is the only way to return for many as the only way to take the country to take their institutional structures to conquer and a new government investment.</seg>

<seg id="165">The call has been on Twitter among other things, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: Morgen National Assembly, Friday prayers on Civil War and November 3, all to Caracas to Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="171">The images of the martens, published in real time, are among other things, an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country, but also disputes with policemen and advocates of the government.</seg>
<seg id="172">One of the most frequently divided images shows a protesters that calls through the protection of the party, "You will kill me, because I have hunger?"</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, the pictures that tell of conflicts, as well as reports of suppression and mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="177">Very large waves, the news about polished repression in the centrally located north of Maracay in the central area of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There are protesters in the local cathedral, to protect themselves from the police in order to protect the police and determination of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later, they were able to leave the cathedral again, but the protests went on.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, a few protesters tried to hold a police force, including these woman in the Andenstaat (TÃ¡chira):</seg>
<seg id="181">Women in TÃ¡chira does not worry, because you could see anything else that many nationgardists do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, this is a InfoComm-round, which forms the magnitude of suppression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship of the country was suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had the validity of the demand for a tenment process in question - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the street.</seg>
<seg id="185">Myteks Media Labs found:</seg>
<seg id="186">NicolÃ¡s and Diosdado claim that 1% of the signatures are fake.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here is your tenure!</seg>
<seg id="188">On the street!</seg>
<seg id="189">Other words these protests as a further step in the fight against a government, which led out of their vision is little against the devastating economic crisis and would prefer to be more critical votes.</seg>
<seg id="190">They have taken so much - but the fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">The martens always take over frequency and intensity.</seg>
<seg id="192">Some Venetians, the media told the media, they are to hungry, to take part in a strike, rather than work or buy.</seg>

<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced from his father to take the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian town of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>

<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not been looking for his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting in the BÃ¼rde, the same name as his father bear to the most brutal military associations in La Perla who observed at the age of 15, he has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family fury.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I believed that this was in order.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret magent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child, with 15 years you don't notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I was able to recognise that my father had a dieb, folks and murder.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriebeamter. during the Argentinean military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983, his father from 1976 to 1978, he became a deputy commander of the intelligence department of 141 in prison La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="221">Pass just that they lead you not one day, and I need to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers "Party.</seg>
<seg id="223">That is why he forbade me to go back into the sports hall. some days later he took me with the work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me, I would be secret magical.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that was in order. for so my father had made me.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the military base, I had to destroy paper, which had belonged to the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: UniversitÃ¤tsmedizin, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simple everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">Over, the prisoners will be tortured.</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me a total of four times to La Perla with - everything in the year 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">For the first and last time he met me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time he commanded me to switch to me. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - just all possible - stood there.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little in a blanket of popes and ordered me to wear it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big clumsy silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">At this day, I went to the other end of the Barhoe, where the stolen items were absent and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he said on an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Over, the prisoners will be tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I mored into, and saw a song, on the people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">They looked like a single bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later, I found out that they had put an end to the end of a cable. the other end was fixed at the body of the person who had been fixed there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They fessated a man with hands of hand over the bed, shot him with water and hunt him a charge of 220 Volt to the genitalia.</seg>

<seg id="243">The gestank there was quite... how a dirty Windel.</seg>
<seg id="244">Later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came from his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body in need is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I never forget to forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked me: how is it only possible that man can do one another as much.</seg>
<seg id="248">'ich knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were found with handcuffs and eye bind.</seg>
<seg id="250">He talked with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose LÃ³pez, a civilians who was also charged in the process) and I took the opportunity to look at a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background, I saw a series of mattresses, on which bare people with the face down, - all were in hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">In the vicinity of the sunk humans quiet on the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">When my father noted that I saw the prisoners, he said, "What guckst du as, Arschloch?"</seg>
<seg id="254">I was opposing the enemy "Why hast thou me?"</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and was buried in a pit by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that my father said to the house of it.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to La Cuadra, some rooms which have been identified as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero went there for a man and killed.</seg>
<seg id="260">The civilian from the civil society is Jorge Romero, who also was indicted in La Perla-Ribera, Students RaÃºl Mateo Molina.</seg>
<seg id="261">In the following video, Emilio Fessia, the head of the La Perla Memorial, was named by the former folliars.</seg>
<seg id="262">The way you came here on which you came here, is also the way to come back here.</seg>
<seg id="263">When you look on the map, you'll see that they were about this track and were then tortured for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="264">Here, their names were changed and they got as part of the process of the process a number.</seg>
<seg id="265">If they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra, until the arrangement of the above came, they should be laid out.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lies - the Euphrism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'War Crimes'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all possible stolen things with home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time, at the age of the age, I don't know what the "war of war" - as it was called it.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was in the military, I was in the gendarmerie - I was clear that war of war was a Bajonett or maybe military rabbits, which you have walled to one enemy.</seg>
<seg id="271">Luis Alberto Quijano joined his son.</seg>
<seg id="272">Archive of the archive</seg>
<seg id="273">But if you go into a house and the refrigerator, the turntables, clothing, painting, money... sticky, then is not a wareness but vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I always asked me, like my father, the head of the security forces, with this Vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer in the gendarmerie and me would never noticed it into a house and to steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do it.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a criminal and I answered: and you, who thou wilt cars on the road stipst?</seg>
<seg id="280">You're not a crime?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded before Wut, smote me and cried:</seg>
<seg id="282">If you are so far, then I will find you and encircled you.</seg>
<seg id="283">We need no one another!</seg>
<seg id="284">This was my father.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have not only good memory to him.</seg>
<seg id="286">When I said in the process, I showed a photo of back then, on which I had a jacket and a roller sweaters in wool. both had my father from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still brought clothes with home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, the defense was accused of having committed to his crimes against this crimes. I did not resist, no problem, they can set me at the burden what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">I was soak there, to announce that.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the body is the last abomful act of the body.</seg>
<seg id="291">Now, where I'm older the age of I'm gree.</seg>
<seg id="292">I have children. if you've got only once children, you recognize the value of a life.</seg>
<seg id="293">We are developing and detects that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">Well, you have gone out during the dictatorship of people. but to do the body should leave disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why can lead me?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day my father brought a girl with home, whose mother had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">She was like our pet, almost as a dog - only that it was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always got the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">It would have been possible to bring it to the prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess, it was simply decided to kill these people. but to how to keep their bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">In these people, these people had not had their families, which could be given up their remains of the remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body can be the last abomful act to do one man.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father spoke to me when the democracy was re-introduced, they holed them to eliminate the remains of the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="305">They were crushed and somewhere - no idea, where. "you will never find something," said my Father.</seg>
<seg id="306">But anything remains of course.</seg>
<seg id="307">I saw, as you have killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Just about it clear: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I even went even with the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just have spoken about the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought to indicate my father, originated during a meeting when he was placed under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I had the accusations because of all of the grotesque, which I had to experience himself due to him.</seg>
<seg id="313">He suddenly said, "I don't know. I haven't killed."</seg>
<seg id="314">I felt sad, and asked me, that the whole of the Patriotic Patriotiation and the "Western and Christian feelings" that they are supposed to have defending well.</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I sent:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you like to me?</seg>
<seg id="317">I saw, as you have killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed terrible crimes, and you have forced me as a child, to participate.</seg>
<seg id="319">He only conflicting only "Na then I am going to."</seg>
<seg id="320">Exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010, I refundable to receive the first indication.</seg>
<seg id="322">I finally detected, that he was a reaker.</seg>
<seg id="323">No one can cause me that I am the default. I finally spoke against my own Father.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of KYOTO, customers have opened a newly opened center in which one can rely on an extremely happy translation in the last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a sign, the Japanese word (coachet sha), the "older driver" means that maybe, maybe also with BÃ¶sem, & # 8212; and "terrible driver" was translated. "</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September at electronic ads in the entrance hall and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Machining of the original photos of Joshua Levine, divided into the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was the translator Julian Holmes, one inhabitants Kyotos, retired. he was also aware of the local time at the time.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Protocol, Khimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">How could it come to such a English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This shows that no one has read the translation.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is a reward for older people and in an international city, such as Kunacceptable, "said Holmes.</seg>
<seg id="356">The faulty English translation was initially removed. the name "reception" (english: "terrible drivers") was later replaced by the appropriate name, albeit a grammar not quite correct name "elder" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police killed in the Kyoto Protocol for the translation errors. furthermore, she explained that the mistakes was already shown in the text, and that the translation was not checked for her judgment before she was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"it is sorry that older people were worded by inadequate correction (translation) for our part," said the police.</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News has a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "fearful" was denouncing as an appropriate description by the police. according to the police, the proportion of elderly people who are involved in accidents are involved in accidents, but quite a reason for concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, in 2005, 1,941 of a total of 19.460 accidents were caused by seniors. this corresponds to a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, caused the seniors 1,803 of a total of 11,850 ounces.</seg>
<seg id="364">This share rose to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents decreased in total, the proportion of seniors had risen in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">In particular, the following reporter in Yahoo published of the article published in Yahoo published in Yahoo published of the article ans of Light, which show the preliminary parts of the Japanese, against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo on the translation errors received the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">- "Is this (" terrible driver ") about the reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">"" "if there is good, the translation is not really not, or?"</seg>
<seg id="370">- "I find not find that the real translation errors is."</seg>
<seg id="371">There are not a few of these comments.</seg>
<seg id="372">Why "Engrish" is so widespread</seg>
<seg id="373">Translation errors are widespread in Japan and Asia.</seg>
<seg id="374">The Engrish.com website is a true locality for this bizarre error in English.</seg>
<seg id="375">Photo of Flickr-users Andrew.</seg>
<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation items are diverse.</seg>
<seg id="377">To overlay two important functions: passive language skills to understand the starting text and an active language skills to transfer him into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active language of the target language - something that is in the case in the case in general, is the conviction that translator in the target language - not in the initial language - motherboards are supposed to be in the initial language.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French mother, for example, should not translate the French in French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ a staff of English as a mother tongue, translations in English to English. this may be a lack of understanding for the transfer, cost wings, or the relatively small number of English matures, the Japanese learning.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees have to manufacture translations, but then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is actually made, as the translator made - no matter how good or bad to a language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Automated translations are also widely used - often with fun results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verrenches and stock sets, which are taken through mechanical translations, show that this technique can't replace a human translators. this applies to some languages for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English formulations in Japan, including the most common prints, often used T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylish reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr-users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors like jewelry still acceptable, or at least harmless. but of great companies or by the government, which means the means of ensuring higher standards, you can expect careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto uses a repent source for their translations.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: protests and Zensuranium measures on the Internet and TV.</seg>
<seg id="391">Main site of Portals "Navegar con Libertad" (free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, melted Venezuelan Internet users, that they don't have access to the online broadcaster Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the Internet performances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters reported cases of protests in Caracas, which were organized by oppositionist groups, which NicolÃ¡s Maduros government officials.</seg>
<seg id="395">Protests started in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and the tasks of Parliament on the Executive and the Supreme Court himself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a Traceran. he pointed out that the connection can be cut, and recommended the users, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zenz: activated your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems to be locked to the internet pages Venezuelan provider to be locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the site of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay, the Venetians with Internet access, especially in times of riots.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been around protests in the reporting of protests. at that time, the commission for Telecommunication enforced them with monetary policy and closure after they would continue to report about the demonstrations, as the Commission looked up as a call on violence. "</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels I applied me at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing, that the lower is lower than two litres of limonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfillet confirmed later that not only Vivoplay through a sperm of the domain name system (DNS), but also two other online transmitter. this also applies to the website to take their meetings on the National Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research studies of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, showed that the local Internet providers use buses. this is a technique through which the DNS server requests your domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If your website is blocked by the DNS, reply the server, or refuses the request at a call of such website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS sperre: @ elicoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">In VPITV, a third locked channel, the transmission was set on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV-camera Elvis Flores was transferred to the protests in Caracas, was transferred to the protests in Caracas.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten, while he was found in police.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on show again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Even though some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government reported that the government has been regulated by Internet connections - so the Venetians will keep access to multimedial reporting on the current trends in the country.</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household, where they didn't work together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her study's graduation, she returned once again into the house and heard the owner of the house, and heard about it. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "she has become a little bit" "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga has never been treated like a daughter.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, in Paraguay the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to work to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The shop is quite simple: a great family with little money exceeds its minderage-old son or their minderyear-old daughter to another, small family. in the case, the child will receive the child food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned, it is that the children must be paid for countless days of housework, never to be paid and victims of abuse and missions can be raised, and all that as part of a contract you can not lift.</seg>
<seg id="425">These as Criadazgo called the practice in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of the society and despite many complaints by human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies, Alvarenga has been a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - raised doubts and denouncement.</seg>
<seg id="428">They tried to name the things out of the name, because the feeling of gratitude, which is vaccinated to Criaditas, is in general confidential.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double bulb," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">It is one of the family to improve their daughter in faith, that they do so their training to improve their position in society and "somewhat out of themselves," to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family, which takes care of the girl, and whose exploitation was justified by faith, making them a chance that else didn't get any training, otherwise no training would be hungry.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>

<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the budget of the former military-owned TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as the government in an area of population.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants on the east of the capital, AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">By the end of January 2016, Ferreira proposed on MarÃ­n as long as they suffered fatal violations.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment on the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made deep practice in the paraguayan society of the Criadazgo's practice for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They recorded the criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came to protest in protest together and demanded that there are no other Carolina "in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the Girl and photos were widespread in the social media.</seg>

<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier, unpunished the rights of children.</seg>

<seg id="452">They want to be TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of girls who had sentenced her Criadita to 30 years in prison.</seg>

<seg id="454">Everyday life of an Criadita</seg>

<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, Concourse, and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to go back to all work and began to sell on the streets or on the market sweets to earn money.</seg>

<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita into the capital of AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employer, Alvarenga has taken place between four and six hours each day.</seg>

<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliament, recently ordered a bill to "the regulatory submission regarding the use of social networks and social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">If he is adopted by the Parliament, users of social media will need to register social media in Egypt at a government's government to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">Based on the law, then a place was set to use, citizens and citizens have been using permission to use social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months of acceptance of the law, users would have to register users and users at the site with its right name and number of identity numbers to register social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If you want to do this, this could bring a punishment of up to six months in prison or a money buck.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragrams and in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt, the social media defined as "jedwede application that runs on the Internet and is used to communicate with other by voice, video art and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is caused by the law, as Egyptian authorities can use the users and users of registration. not clear, in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation at the stage of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentary report and sponsors of the law, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a password for a user name and a password "by using the firewall, the Facebook blocks."</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt is planning to use a firewall on national level around Facebook. due to those who would be able to submit for the Egyptians and the Egyptians, information on their identity, to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts in front of site are skeptical to the technical feasibility of the Vorum.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (based on German) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, on German "Egyptian Initiative for personal rights"), Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I have strongly strongly encouraged the technical capacity and understanding the understanding, neither authority in Egypt concerning things that do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they make it so before that as they are violent physical and private rooms, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">When I take it seriously, then it means that they will apply a strong supervisage system to apply citizens, or not. this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people, and also to bring them to a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is not far more realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">To be adopted as a law, the design must be discussed at the legislatures of the Parliament and the constitutional committee, before it proceeds into the plenary debate.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and suspension will be successful, or not, the design "stands in line with a pro-military thinking in the parliament, in whose sense that no change of narration will be present on the image space," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">In the past year, Tamer El-Shahawy ordered a bill to the sentence of cyber crime that was found guilty of life imprisonment for those who are found guilty to threaten the "public order" and "protest."</seg>

<seg id="527">Why is this certain species of Leopards so important?</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, for the northeastern Japan daily Kahoku Shimpo achieved progress to rebuild the life of those who had been affected by the "Thirty Catastrophe" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake, a tsunami and an Atom-accident in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="545">Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its registered office in Sendai the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi Prefecture with Miyagi Prefecture, who had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring fields of Fukushima and Iwate were forced, because the tsunami had to disappear throughout the coastal cities.</seg>
<seg id="547">At the Fukushima City, Fukushima City had an accident, so that alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo special report shows which progress had been achieved in the past six years, to rebuild the life of the local resident.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper covers both statistics of the Japanese health authorities as well as poll-results of the people.</seg>
<seg id="550">The residential building of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that, by December, 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts are registered at the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate, in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwata.</seg>
<seg id="552">In the three prefectures, Miyagi, a total of 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has finished 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Even six years after the catastrophe and six years after the catastrophe and evacuated by Behelfsandular (for example, casusu juutaku) to the final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-way catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live from Behelfsck for nearly 80 000 people.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, more than 36 000 people lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such elements.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the Fukushima evacuation out of Fukushima, in 2011, while Miyagi lost its successful day. more than 75 per cent of the evacuation who have signed after Desaster in Behelfsck have been resettled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The work of the work and everyday life in the three affected by the prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Just like the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper, 1074 from 1100 schools that were affected by the evil forces, its gates until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction is far more difficult in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of fishing pipes in Iwate and Miyagi are now operating in operation, Fukushima only 30 percent of fishing pipes have been retaken into operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomare accident, have moved in the three prefectures of agricultural land in the area of rural area.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that only a result of the nuclear power is, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed arable land of Fukushima, lies in the "nuclear" nuclear zone. "</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, the tourism has recovered back again, but also remains of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist rates in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same state as before the evil. Fukushima, however, can have only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that, since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their habitats.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population to the next major earthquakes?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a complete picture, the newspaper brought numerous findings under the native population and under the evacuation by. she asked about the stand of the rebuilding and also, as you have changed to the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction of the article describes the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo brought a survey through to bring more about the tsunami awareness under the native population of experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey brought that 83.1 percent of the local resident population, measures have been cleared to future earthquake and tsunamis in order to be prepared.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of the respondents said that still not enough to be used in catastrophes.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="576">In their issue of the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo newspaper increased their attention to the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had the massive earthquakes and the disastrous tsunami - no, the Prefecture of Fukushima was a witness to the worst disaster of disastrous, atomaren accidents, who had to experience Japan ever.</seg>
<seg id="578">Nearly 63 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were transferred to the territories outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, a little more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement stores.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the 2017 stand, there is still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">Most of the evacuation-areas are most of the evacuation which are still going to be able to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima City with massive construction projects. this is a building projects that are part of the Olympic Games, which will be held in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="625">The forgotten villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso included almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The parish Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, who is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as central Central and Spanish sugar mill - known that there is no wet sugar-specific sugars on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities have been laid down in the sugar tubes factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the result, the sugar tubes in the region was quiet, and the factory lost after and after its plants, until only the rumors of steel and concrete remained remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to find new.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some cases the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and penile every day to factories, which still mahlen.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soloist of veteran, who stands out every day at 4: 00 am, the crisis in the sugar tube industry didn't offer his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are no more active in the east of the sugar cane factories which have been in operation after a long time because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">This was something that he was not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene is reminiscent of this, that in MaÃ±alich, the sugar cane sugar would not be kept, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar tubes industry is already the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the Ineffefficiency, the bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production of 1.6 million tons of sugar, produced less than the 1910 produced quantity.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for some decades a motive for the country have been a motive for the country, but the poor did not have any curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why the Cuban sugar cane has been switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway stig of the church saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economical need: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they were unportable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate on the more efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">Only the factories will be left to produce sugar for most 4 Centavos (0,03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">Solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs, which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar plantations and the access crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price climbed to about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar will stay between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report "Landwirtschaftskammer" from the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would achieve the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar would export roughly 85 million dollars for the country's country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything was done well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's Day is going to go with safety in history," that were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From there, the process of restructured in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the stripping of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar tube factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has worked since 1967 in the factory.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene is known as a soldier, about the closure of the factory, the word that he is repeated on most, "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Nearly all those questioned, same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to get the place, it was a full time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first day, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">This was officially abolished in the documents that are only distinguished by the parts that are removed, the address and the date would be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulrika's Rosales del Toro, only the minister could not confirm any compensation.</seg>
<seg id="663">From there was the responsibility of the responsibility and the letters came to more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for two years, and he was one who received the letters, and he received the letters. "the country had no money for that in operation, there was no money," insured.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, is waiting for the pension in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was accused of having participated in the disclosure of the factory, where he helped him to be involved.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part, he removed, demonized one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and major work generator was removed.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, no alternatives for the workplaces and services, which were generated in the municipalities of the municipalities in which they were found.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youth of the First Nations communities in the whole of Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them. they do it with hip-hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">Since 2014, as part of the N 'we Jinan-Tour will bring mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were directed by a teacher David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked with the Cree hip-hop group of the Northstar.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop ends that the young people in talks with discussions such as "cultural identity, language, dispute, love, self-acceptable" or whatever you come in the meaning.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, in which the young people are the main actor.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo, in the territory of the Kitsumum First Nation in British Columbia reveals the history of Highway 16, also called "Highway" in western Canada, on which nearly two dozen were mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>

<seg id="704">On the Facebookpage of N'we Jinan, the Strophe is available in the inscription, as well as translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel me, than would be interested in me for me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day to take you our jrei.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we lost our way in life, we lost our way to life.</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will collect us one day,</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, one can see almost each restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers exactly what exactly on the menu if you are at the menu of shokuhin sanpuru (first-out, "plasma models of the courts") from each dish that serves in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The clients see these plastic dishes and decide if they enter the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry that dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic meals.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the toboggan district Kappabashi, there are a variety of these small companies that made those plastic dishes created by the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga, over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">Most of the Japanese have these plastic meals are so usually that they are not able to rely on them. however, a new trend is turned into most striking mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">Naver Matome published the Blogger itinii series of social media links and photos which show this unusual Twist with shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic shewed cell belts, as they are shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial food were turned into kitesurfing objects, such as in this case, refrigerated:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shocks and refrigerated for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of the essence is increasingly elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaisen-don (a popular travel shell with seafood) turned into a cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand.</seg>

<seg id="735">Some mobile phone and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case icura or salmon has been used, a popular topping, served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">For someone there would be someone who say: "wow, cool, now I can digestible my mobile phone with salmon?."</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will probably be the introductory.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic jacks can also accept a lesser loss form, for example, colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting the ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and handcrafted from dried salmon.</seg>

<seg id="750">Reporting on drug bosses like El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the chief of the Sinaloa cartells, urged the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone on the grape or to the municipalities that learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone bank in a hundred and heated tombs, the stories of numerous parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, their legs may be healing.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal "Apruna Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "to learn the drug to learn these victims, and the stories of people who told them to enforcement agencies in the fight against enforcement agencies and antitrust authorities.</seg>
<seg id="754">The project describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime, we do not only fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much lower-reaching.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops include, because they need to be threatened by drug addiction, and all municipalities like that many kilometers have to go to buy a little bit like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vique cambian por el miedo" (German: "as fear life") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A major character is Guadalupe, a father who searches every weekend secret graves after his son.</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "Apruna vivir con el narco," why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We don't have to show the faces of those who are fear of fear. we need to show the conflict and show the conflict and state leadership.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a writer of Animal PolÃ­tico wrote this post of Taxco, set up in the State of Guerrero in Central Mexico.</seg>

<seg id="784">She writes:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old Cousin consider that he is big. and it is not normal that people can hear songs about the "Heldentations" of the Strains, when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, that when they would have those who have lost someone who have lost someone, and those who fear have so much happens.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories are to blooming numbers in a statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">The Tatennia of man is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbour can be justified that they were "sacked."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to talk about such a load of ships if they are not stir and silent.</seg>

<seg id="801">How is it, in a settlement on the edge of the most endangered city of Mexico?</seg>

<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years ago, when he was just a few blocks from his home, the bloody bodies of his father saw, who had been shot by armed men from a driving car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez, looked like:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as violence as violence and the struggle against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most endangered city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Civil Council's Security Council and the government of the United States.</seg>

<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that organized the organised crime in Mexico, and permeating the soul of the country.</seg>

<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accidents seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release it was irrevocally used in action since its first release, they have taken place in Nigeria, Nigeria, which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This wrong copy of picture and event - "false description" or "falcons context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">It comes with questions about our long-long images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank trucks crossed the village of Sange in the East of the DR Congo, kipped and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected by Africa. the streets in the region have become dangerous pitta, which were difficult to keep difficult.</seg>
<seg id="827">However, the tank trucks fell victim to the victims.</seg>
<seg id="828">It is described by a fireball which blasphalted houses, including a cinemas in the vicinity, the full of people who had the football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses and mixed corpses were scattered in the streets of the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to nonknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "This is Nigeria." from the Imgur users Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.multiple photos of the event make the gruesfull scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above, an example of this is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of foals, which are on the floor, during people they look.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story is not its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo goes on several times to social media, blogs and other platforms, but certainly not to be attributed to the lifting of life, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram attacked the remote village of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported to have to flee from atrocities where they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Homes and shops were burnt down in the streets and bones were burned in the streets and Geba.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">The numbers could not be confirmed. "no one stayed back to count LEICA," said a inhabitants of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were crushed, shot or burnt.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only from satellite imagined the follow-up period could be depicted.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the army corps in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military in Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram, to win the country (examples of the year 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here's the picture of the DR Congo is back on, when it was more susceptible to the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">You are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this feasible use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of patches with flaws; Africa check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was launched as a reward for massacres.</seg>
<seg id="852">Yet another step further bring to personal comments such as this example, the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange appeared also in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash, published by the United Nations, those who could escape the strokes, rape and several dead, some of burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported violence against the Rohingya reported Posts, such as the following, that these descriptions brought together with photos from the DR Congo, brought together:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an acidi-Arab news page, who claimed in 2012, President Myanmars expressed himself in the assassination of the Rohingya Muslim. in addition, she had used the picture from the DR Congo to get this information.</seg>

<seg id="859">The worldwide operating range of false statements</seg>
<seg id="860">Tracks of this wrong coupling "goes back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">You can see how far the borders, can be seen as far as information limits.</seg>
<seg id="862">A moving picture search with the search engine at the TinEye has seen under 18,8 billion paintings (as of 3 May 2017) 344 pictures, which are very similar to the above picture of the DR Congo.</seg>

<seg id="902">Malaysia provides two extreme example of the image from the DR Congo, with one role, the sympathy against the Nigerian massacre, and on the other hand of a blogging, the allegations of the Rohingya, but the photos of them were abducted.</seg>
<seg id="903">Myanmar, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="904">The government of Myanmar published a judge, what they worked as "aborted news and photos, the international media, international human rights organisations and governments, in an attempt to create abnormalities regarding Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="905">This judge, which has been published exclusively in English, has also been used on fake images of rumors, those who kill the Muslims of Buddhisten, and the other rum (what often used by burmese nationalists).</seg>
<seg id="906">Russia, 2012. "Fitted from the age to ÑÑ the charges were" "" "Ten Commandments," "" "gestions" "" "worried about worths" "" "?" (Christianophobia or political provocation?).</seg>
<seg id="907">This post, which addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox church, demonstrates that the image of the DR Congo will NOT be Muslims who kill Christians.</seg>
<seg id="908">Saudi Arabia, 2012 / 2014.</seg>
<seg id="909">This news site has been revealed that the president of Myanmar Tha His 2012 was alleged that MÃ¶nche and politicians participated in the killings of the Rohingya Muslim, and brought the story with the image from Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication, the picture is still included in it.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article, published by the Boko Haram, published by the Boko Haram, published by the Catholic news site AnÃ¡lisis Digital, has expressly stated that the image was not from the daughters, but it claims that it was a "similar dschip attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">As a picture later, in connection with the massacre of Boko Haram of 2015 in circulation, the newspaper El Pais tried to prevent it to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanÄ±yoryaUyuy" (Nigeria burning, the world).</seg>
<seg id="915">The image of the DR Congo, provided with this Twitterhashtag, and saved a discussion under Muslims following the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 and at Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities took place these events that took place in the name of Islam, a larger attention.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The image was shaken by the Boko Haram in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times retains), but the messages that were linked to no religious context were taken out of religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the objective of attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of media coverage by Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (1), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message that allegedly was allegedly written by a "Father Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacres, in circulation, discussion discussions like this here on Vietnam and explained it to Falschberg.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the message, in which the image was included in the DR Congo, the organisation of the Claretan missionaries and Father Juan Carlos Martos.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are further confirmed examples of a faulty use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">On other Accounts, generator and pages in the following countries (at the portfolio in Grau), the TinEye also boasts more completely retraceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data agreements with URLs and time / data stamp) exist on the webcrawler and have enacting on image file in connection with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, that was only published in the original manuscript from 2010, the image may probably be correct, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (subframe) that these posts go through. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence of Christians through Muslims, or in the defense of Muslims - the victims of the Rohingyas.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second Framing uses the image to discuss how a African life has been assessed by a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand, and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it's worth to investigate how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">Another question is however, what happens when reading these images can not give longer faith.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are two people who have unintended to practice the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">The mood of the mistakes and false information is that actual gentlefts are untrue and impeeled it the actual grey of what is actually in the DR Congo, in Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread-violent images was already presented at detail in detail (here, for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">A argument is that the return of images is receded to detect the tragedy. from time to time, these pictures can even be carried out by the victims.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern that they are violent images, readers, and viewers, and to see them the ability to empze empathy (such as a violent media to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While some are violent representations in the news media, we are estimated that they are indispensable for the present news release.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technological experiments with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." you'll have to think about the situation, in which a picture is somewhat different, but in which context of the context or on completely misuse type can be used.</seg>
<seg id="940">One of the investigation is supposed to be taken into consideration, however, how international them can be taken into consideration.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name of Untranslatable (e.g. dt. unbeatable), language classes can do a selection of words from all over the world, which would not be difficult to translate difficult or at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are available in each language: you want certain situations or feelings, which are often very complex or specific.</seg>

<seg id="947">But all conflicting are hard-looking any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or an expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes something background are necessary to understand exactly what a word is meant.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words were collected for a whole time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese, or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird chose to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog, we find the words of the VAT from Vanuatu, as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - BemÃ¼h you need to recognition your parents in recognition how to have been around in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik, spoken in parts of Brazil, as:</seg>

<seg id="1003">People who work with whom I work, or people who have been know me since years, separate me - the Sahar which they know - from the extensive concept of "Muslims," which has built up in their notion.</seg>
<seg id="1004">You arrive me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are around 1.7 billion Muslims in the world.</seg>

<seg id="1008">We may be able to be Muslim to be aware of different kind. but somehow we will be able to invite all in the same Muslim drawers.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer work is so good in our collective presentation that as soon as Muslims who can't fit there as I do not fit.</seg>
<seg id="1010">Muslim men will be Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="1011">I am not alone anymore.</seg>

<seg id="1016">As Jalaluable in Rumi as old as I am now, he was a Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholars.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day, at which he died, the center of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the Western show, religion were deleted, religion, as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This lion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another consists of the inducing images of Muslims, the Western books had already been colonial since the centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">These lockable image is determined by the dark men that should be fear and the exotic woman that should save.</seg>

<seg id="1024">Our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood news will continue to continue.</seg>
<seg id="1025">I worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I saw, like this powerful, faulty interlocking of our Newsfeeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This narrativ amounts to reality, which have led over the past three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries while the United States were not able to choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narractive does not recognize that when French, Muslim women shall bear in public buildings and Saudi women are forced to leave their government through their government to cover their entire body, which are both two pages of the same Medes.</seg>

<seg id="1032">This narrativ has so much and faults our collective products such as deep and faults, that often Sikh men and children are to become the goal of antimusous attacks and schists.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories, which we tell you and because of the kind, in which we tell you, is Islamophobia today not only fear of Islam, religion, but it is fear of the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1034">Among the 1.7 billion Swiss francs</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry we do more than just stories about things that are based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We also create Narrative, who help us to understand the world.</seg>
<seg id="1038">And my industry is fabulous, however, to capture the narrativ of the 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1050">We don't have to be theological experts to be "Muslim" or by almost always for additional security check in the airport.</seg>
<seg id="1051">There are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholar, Muslim activists and interreligious activists, which are deprived of Islam, widespread over the Islam.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These lies will be produced by the ongoing band of a well-captured Islamophobia with money transfer, Think tanks and experts for Falschinformation that are already faulty image of which a Muslim is; or which is Islam is manipulated.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Due to the stories, which we tell us and due to the way, in which we tell it, Islamophobia is in more than a stranger, who is a woman's head.</seg>

<seg id="1136">May it be a possibility to enter here and now in spite of a language barrier with somebody there?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the stories of stories in its original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently over a different initiative of Steven Bird, the Unrecoverable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS is not written on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is a try to get the language variety of big cities and to recognize them.</seg>
<seg id="1140">Indeed, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in the United States, where TLS have already been carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not completely so small languages are not given to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the purpose of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided, when we create cities, diversity - secure spaces, in which people don't forget to belong to them.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listening to it," to understand, "check out these events instead," the listeners will instead to estimate that "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, exchange counter is their history first in their own language and translate or explain it to English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional counter, their devotion and their representation make sure that the audience could be realized.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call for laughter and emotions, when the language should not be longer a barrier.</seg>

<seg id="1152">They were very happy with me!</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book, which was released last year and is freely available, includes a number of articles which employ-free culture in the face of suppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge and how the true costs are associated with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researcher, researchers, and authors have worked on the movements for free knowledge, to look over the nebula, who gives our newsfeeds and create a little sense of our experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to liberate Bassel Khartabil, to liberate the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteers who has been in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was taken from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have since then do not have any information about his current state or position.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title of collectively, gives his friends and his family a voice that, for his release, and who want to know it back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel has a high price for its participation in a free culture, many of us begin to think about their own fatalities, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Are we here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">We decided to do?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What we found in this process of extreme transition effects?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open-source and digital activity has been in the detention of Syrian authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel from Adra prison, a non-military facility was transferred to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi told that the "military police Bassel was based on the basis of a" strict ban "in the military court of his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that it was contacted on 12 November 2015 by people contacted himself as Insider of the Assad regime and put it out of an alleged death against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The residence and condition remain still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer in Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role in which access to the internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threv, a designer, Technologe, and at the moment of the head of the head of New Palmyra, a project that Bassel founded, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Maybe none of Bassels of cultural prototypes was predictive as the work that he began with a group of archaeologist and 3D artists around 2005, designed to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the way of numerous civilizations and of the Greek-Roman architecture types with hiescent traditions and persican influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">In that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS was doing everything that architecture is not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but the world embodied.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip, into the digital archaeology and the conservation has created a period of time created for the public, as well as scientists and artists in the future of uninvaluable value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">This project was not able to close the project so far.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her man to share his knowledge with other, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">My whole life spent my whole life to dream of freedom and bassel teaching me, she was poor.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I am his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English in English, even when he was found in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned English to read English on to write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has given his knowledge with each person who asked him. he has taught other ingested, English to write and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet for me.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He has also brought other insured, as they use the computer, at least theoretically, without that it had actually stopped in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a commission, which she wrote in prison in the years 2012 to 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura spent a year in the book together.</seg>
<seg id="1223">They brave the lyrics, when she visited him, and he overtook it from the Arab in English.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mosambique's: due to corruption prosecuted director after arrest warrants back on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambique's reacted with wrath on a corruption case in which a government member, after half of his sentence, returned to the workplace in the state of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is the Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment with four other accused of accused of genocide by 54 million Metikal (approximately 800 000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public money of the airports of Mozambique, the Council of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good lead and demanded immediately its restoration in the company, what happened on April 19th then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement of the General Attorney's Office of the Republic, which granted the application to refer the request to refer to Cambaza, back to its old post since the company had no disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, hot many inhabitants are not good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The center for public integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle, the decision of the company, to put the director again:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a backward step in the fight against corruption and clear the feeding of transparency and even a backward step in respect to the efforts of our legal system, the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we refer to the knowledge that the company would have to carry out a disciplinary process against the influencing trade.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company schwieg seems to be there and causes no appropriate legal steps for the application of the appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a major voice in the Muslim social media, reflects this behaviour and considered the case as "contradicting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be advisable to be convicted after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them saved.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could not paid presentations and motivated words, he could advise and his Image polishing.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has been involved in the company that he helped to add damage to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza will be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistance!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique, and student of Political Science in Brazil, he says the director of no morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza will be rewarded by the state, because he did not believe it to someone in such a way that the state has already been massive massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the Moral and return to the state, * he had already serve a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead, only himself served on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state, as handing it himself to become an inexhaustive money source and the state itself, this man has become tired and finally sentenced to a long sentence of prison.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why the man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, remember that a dieb was in prison.</seg>

<seg id="1281">In Twitter, reactions were also worsening:</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to information from Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network gave her podium from the net, because they were the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although above the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin or in general as Adjekectively. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook tells the word "Kalar" or so-in-mice (in burmesan Scripture) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of Hasselt in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">Over the past years, the ascent of radical nationalist movements has given an extremely low account notation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by Ultra nationalists as Hasselt to Muslims in which a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat the language in Myanmar in Myanmar, the company has a lot of sensual content on his platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">Today 'Kalar' may normally be brought together with racism in conjunction with racism, but the word is not allowed to be removed from Hasselt.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts, in which they have used the use of the word, or doubts about his use, have been committed.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several burmese words with basic different meanings which have the same letter as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmesan even 'Kalar htaing', as well as other words as' Kalar Pae '(age-age),' Kalar OAT '(Kamel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboochutzer Aung Kaung Myat declared the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was erased today, because he contained the word of Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends to spiritual kind, whether they could reusing his back pain, he made a word game.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The Battery la - "healing" (ku) + The question word (la) is very similar to the raciist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hur is the opinion that they would be a group of radically nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook analytic will have to spread all Posts soldering to spread over the killing of racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "the word" Kalar "is no manually manual." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filter the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The monitor will not understand what you don't find on the Facebox.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What should make it instead, the mail is carefully sent to analyse and check it the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar Pae" (age-age).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these three-called nationalists, have spread out a rather good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is at the time to contemplate their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the promotion is a strong signal to everyone, the Hasslanguage could spread the efficiency of this strategy are not long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proved that the users of social networks are simply plugged to begin to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the set word to press their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to erase his podium when he wanted to know his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironary, my post was removed by Facebook and me, the liken, item, and parts of contents for 24 hours, because the Post Community Standards are not assigned to "the Facebook Community Standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of Posts from people who don't have negative intentions, or simply try to show their opinions against Hasselt's radically nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed to do nothing with Hasselt:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post-speech by Facebook is removed from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author announced his mind about how extreme Nationalism and religious grounds are poalism in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook is said before the beginning of the initiative more, for example the burmese Internet community will ask the Council:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a charity intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words to shaving, will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they have begun a local context or technical support, and as words as "chair" or "pea curry" have been banned.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they have made error, they did not tried to make the random podium.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they were only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefit, which had a great turnover, would be a great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Bevelling automatic censorship has provided users with plenty of spending under the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of getting serious, users can now look forward to Facebook and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hasselt to see if their podium will be taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook-Posts who don't have Hasselt, but still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and see an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Only to try to try whether Facebook contains the post, the word of Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, with approval.</seg>
<seg id="1334">The Post states "If you are a doctor if you are healing for people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, with approval.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious finalists, have used social networks to expand their votes and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, Hasselt is believed to remove violence in the municipalities in Myanmar in addition, especially in the area of Rakhine, where they were forced to flee from Muslims and Buddhisten to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was said to be for his say that grew up in Hasselt to his burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than just like the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to work on the context as a code concentrated initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1399">While the platform remain locked, there are several Mirror pages (pages, which will be updated with the contents of Wikipedia) and often updated.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution was made by IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform converters all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (e.g. calculator computers), which is based on the system of domain name and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is published in spite of the legal ban, however.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post reported IPFS about his efforts:</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala, and originally appeared on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community of media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was again published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women with the greatest care, the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a Pronomen or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women thought to be respected as well as fear of the consequences, they ought to be abide with the norm, those practices on life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was sentenced to Odisha by the Indian state of Odisha, and by their family and the village community, after having had a secret relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of wives also do not name to name, even under the name, is also common under men. however, they will be far worse by far, if at all, they should not be retrospun in this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village Walhe in the village of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health staff, housewives, a unique Club, and thus became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place just for them alone, on which they discuss the enemy of the Patriarchate and discuss.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which is located in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, operated by the community of Video Volunteers and is taking advantage of the Patriarchate Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paine worked for seven years with help of her video amera at the lifting of practices, such as children's council, and AIDS Inds, and manages this clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It is reported how this clubs has created a safe place for these women and at the same time, they have made a secret place at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video to show Rohini in her discussion round, was the name of women who did not call for their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1482">It has chosen for this subject, because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with an issue, to identify which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The name of their husbands do not respond to the question, is an Brittens, not guilty, and have not guilty them in question.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini said:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition has testifies that a woman named her husband and wishes a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman that doesn't exist. is regarded as a woman without Moral.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply worshifted that we have made us up to this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning of the Rohini, who wanted to work with her husband so never called, at home, in order to try out how it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-law mother.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My wife's mother and my husband had a long time after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, has made himself to me and said, I asked him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in luggage, Rohini started their first Discussion Papers.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it meant a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to bring the discussion with a exercise in speed.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini bat any participant in the name of her husband with various feelings - happy, refuses, sad, lovingly and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked them, "If we can't say the name of our husbands, but they may call us how they want, means that they don't have to mount us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should not be the same as good? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">Some of these women have been married since 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought up the name of her husband, "says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the break of a centuries-old tradition that would never have to speak for the name of their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during all the exercise there was only about kichri, one another decided to allow the entire frustration against him and his family to allow him to leave him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their core was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the case of Adrenaline, in fact, with an old Brittens, the women have decided that they would actually trying to try their husbands to name in their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days, Rohini received a multitude of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what they continued to say women in the head: his wife was not able to hear his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member states decided to do it with dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">She was her father-in-law, she was afraid, and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said, I thought to do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less common and the situation artete in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported how women tries to stop many practices, such as the interest of interest in red dot on the forehead, who shows the adulestatus.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would bear the interest in the red point when he was too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He leighth only and I heard him to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women do not belong together, but my, they are now in a better position, even to choose him to some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the Discussion Papers is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we do a trip at every Discussion Papers.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we have lunch and water, and go into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to make the women to make those who could hear what could hear, "says them.</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last few months, she celebrated her own birth days in her life, she danced with cake; they danced, and sessed them about things that never had never thought of them.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini said:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I've been working on this problems since so many years, and I have also been about some things, for example, as our identities in our husbands are not so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It's feels great to say that certain things can be said, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talk about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been worn since their marriage in Saris.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of most, the okay, but some wanted to have a Salman-Kurta, a vast Hemd of a trousers, they have not bad.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of battle and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes, the Moral interconnected with the Saris and much more, shmugathers their own pair of course (Oberhemden) in a discussion round, so that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they have decided to plan a trip to Goa, where she can bear jeans, and Rohini can be sure to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months have been changed for the first Discussion Papers, Rohini says that the things come to the roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women have provisioned it a few times, but heard it again to say the name of their husks.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, are still included, but only if they are alone and there are no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say the names of their husbands; only one or two women do not bear at every time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in Discussion Papers know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the flow to freedom of movement or their own hangers - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By making other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">As Rohini explained:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">It also have been too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone from us the confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that there are not only limited to 30 families. it is a chain reaction if any woman in the club goes home and other people, what we speak, and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We sit all in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a town or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may be dumm, as Singapore is recognised at the international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was considered to be regarded as the city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of a meeting of the International Relations Association of New York, the ministers noted that many people have criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, because it was compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Supporting the city of Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has put on question whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, although most people go to an error.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to declare that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a town.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice, "The logic," to defend the existing exercise of the power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and lifts, this valuable land to create, you can say that we are finally not an country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It was so vulged to vulged it, so it had a escape of a flight before the responsibilities, a mandatory injury.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore if you are not my land, you eat land?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which it could not measure the political system of Singapore not with other 'normal countries', in view of which he appeared uncrowded.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equal to cities which are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratically elected.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the river Thas, it will be the good old dead bodies of the authorized power of Machthabern who knocked to democrats, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end of the last week of Shanmute, the answers to its American guests regarding our press, our Judikative, of our political system really non-replies.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Appropriate questions tarred with non-answers rationals.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls to Shanmugam, his opinion, as they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">When Singapore is not a country, but a town is, so far, our city is one of the city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Shortly, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful when our current K Shanmugam would take trouble to clarify this point when he was able to clarify this point when it was to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By adding Anon on the blog about his comment, he should begin to read the entire transcript of the conference to read the context of the testimony of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore was a city, and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">As he said that Singapore is rather a "city," be regarded as a country, "he declared why the elections in Singapore has so much easier, even if we enjoy free and wondering elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He was able to win Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw decades had won a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said, Singapore "was not a land," he did not take it in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment over Shanmugam, the leader of a long-growing generation, such as the leader of a growing generation.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I'm talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said to...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least, I knew about Lee KuiYv, and the members of the old Gardes, which I expected to agree with them or not, but that is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I'm sure I'm not sure if he really believes that he is right, and that he is aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review breaking down the weakness of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "Mr. Shanmugam" Successful a mistake, "or was it a pleasures speaker?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we will only be regarded as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on what land continue the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equal to the land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the government cable, the testimonies from Mr. Shanmugam of serious significance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people are more expensive in their military service, they only defend their city but not their land?</seg>
<seg id="1725">If our Prime Minister have to pay our Prime Minister?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the residents of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">If the magazine Journey of a Decade on the preservation of Singapore, Singapore has always been a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"" "I have not told what I said" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence appears to have many people more expensive...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city centre / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often hear how "the defense of the country is above all" etc., but that is not quite correct.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should talk about the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1740">Their answers are displayed here as part of a ongoing series, with the rumors of certain parts of the world, and another Facette will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question of which is made in Japan by most, is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, sorry," I'm sorry, "I am coming from Canada." I'm coming from Canada. "since 1994 I live and again in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation, the conversation is taking place, it is considered courteous, interest in his discerning partner to show personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">On my clarity the standard response follows: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, Nature." many Canadians perhaps inside before Wut if they are kept for Americans, but also unspoiled.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For anyone who don't know, there is little that differs from the Americans of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians create a Canadian flag visible on their backpack if they travel to their backpack.</seg>

<seg id="1766">Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First: as "nice" is to be referred to as "nice" is basically, we are basically - as the cargo, soft, but the most significant figure Ned Flanders out of "The Simpsons" (which has its own Canadian twin home).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada is truly a nation of people like Ned Flanders, this would be a step forward. but the actual problem is in fact that "nice" have no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing that you encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless his, is inconspicuous and uninteresting, and no attention to earn attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">That may be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, down from the things that happen around a round.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go as far as far as to say that the desire, free and alone to be one of the Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own matters.</seg>

<seg id="1776">Canada is not often talk about the fence surrounding the neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We are missing the hot, open kindness, which I now integrate with my American friends.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants, Europe or Latin America, some places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, he is located at the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a corals-pink Brillencoder and gold-coloured earrings in Teddybears-Form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather they themselves) has become a goal for Africans and Haitian, who are on the journey through.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollars per night, the guests can sleep in simple rooms, with cold, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom, there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless, hundreds of African and Haitian migrants are here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez, come the people in full minibus and from the upper part of the coast, they start to call: "mum Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mum Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on the box.</seg>
<seg id="1912">It would not like to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">They also helps them to hospital, and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, they buys them to pay them that they cannot pay them with a Balsam within the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychicque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, is arrived in a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him to asked if the Mama is a reasonable nickname for Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who gave a joghurard) posiert with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">Yes, yes, "he answers with a smile." I really feel that it fits to her, as African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionately.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very well here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to Boston to come to Boston to get there her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but it is for a few Africans, who are on the way to the United States, normally make a normal stop in South America and then go toward the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard a well-known name from mum Africa. "mum Africa is a well-known name on the circuit," says Felix Michelet, a guest of Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitian and Africans often come together to travel together and that Africans already say to Whatsapp by Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his combills, Michelet lived in Brazil in before and has worked as construction workers at the Olympic Games and the football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy, he began his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa: it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I query him if he will contact us in the future with Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mum Africa" is our mother and we will never go back "" "" reply. "we'll always stay in contact." ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells you to send their guests her often text, when they continued to leave them, or to get her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">They don't know much about Africa, but their guests have brought her, chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known, but it is not the only sparks hope for migrants, who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the end of the city, a dead end leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valencia and his family are recorded in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is Polizist and has found that the bus services have sold numerous African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them to help an reasonable price, he then offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment, 25 people, mainly Haitian.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">In Valencia, Valencia explains that he knows what the guests make the guests.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "I lived in the United States." "" "he says." I experienced what she experience. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we have suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was transferred to a raid on his work in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels across Tapachula, comes from Central America, other residents open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez told me that he fled in Honduras with his wife and his three children before people fled from him money, without a plan to have a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked after an accommodation and a unknown, omnidirectional, all its roof, has offered him a roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family lives still since and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of mum Africa, everything was full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the hallways the traveler can consult your phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A small bus is now arrived and has 20 new guests, a majority of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy about that its house is full, but it is also the nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she shaken her album with many photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hair, who has made her a client, some photos of their grandchildren and many travelers more, kids and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">They battle sad, while she is brief for me.</seg>

<seg id="1963">In the notification of Notification, the app is said to get access to terrorist information. "</seg>
<seg id="1964">But kÃ²nÃ­ the authorities also use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because she had installed the app that had changed messages with a private and chat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the notification of the police that the app can determine the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists and would follow, together with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information," including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs Website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system-categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blockation of pornography web pages, by online scam, Troians, and Phot@-@ pages to make users how much time they spend online, and to control the own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">These app with the filters for minors will help to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can be used in many different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote remote control could be able to manipulate the home network of a person to manipulate the home network.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While news information about digital censorship in China mostly on the experiences of users in major cities in the east and south, is the reality very often of nosterer for those who live in remote, urged ethnic minority regions, such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">For unrest and unsatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities are often linked to extreme poverty and monitoring measures as well as routinely and routinely on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Based on Twitter based media outlet "images from Mainland China" (for example, the zenith News in China, displayed photos by a Checkpoint where the residents of the residents are violated if they have the overflow app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian represent that the people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">Mobile notification demanded that the people will install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you have discovered a checkpoint with a device without these software, they could be imprisoned by up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a refund for the technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You have forced to resign the people that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity via Permanent monitoring technology.</seg>

<seg id="1984">In addition, "Images from Mainland China" (for example, a Jingwang product description, which means that the software allows the ability to lift up of a Windows operating system and receives unrestricted access to the computer's hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang computers and cell phones to Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city party, to minimize dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All the government, authorities and related institutions, including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cybersecurity Office for operation of their computer and communication devices.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib speaks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free differences and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib screwed a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The picture was recorded by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib is bringing the most of its time inside; times it up on his screen to his computer, and again at its couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">What you can leave, however, you can discover a cigarette between his fingeradiers or with a Nikotin lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the upper floor of his family house that ended them since 1967; in which Israel finished his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaib family looked forced to move from their village in Palestine in which she had lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib is an passionate activist, who is the conservative majority, and their well-approved opinions on gender roles, sexuality, and free differences between art and Rapture.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often refers often with topics such as orientalism, racism and the situation of the whole Arab world. all these topics could not only be found in his hometown of relevance but also in cities, which will be in Yemen from Damascus to Sanaa in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted through limits, and he can feel that according to the disastrous consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he is not open, he is a special landing against the US American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib believes that his compassion of those who try to survive in war-areas, anything else to do with his identity as "Palestinian poultry" - that he was born himself, even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think because of my own life," says Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then it adds: "I think we have redeemed one man, while he dissolved the nest-cafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this period it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise up to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law states that the public distribution of food during the Ramadan was illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness in order to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee was to do little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the mud-lwarm coffee and the waders of Kent-cigarette in the nose to the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes it feels like a prison in opposition to the neighbouring countries, above all when you have a look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it's easy to do basic things - as in the public during the Ramadan water - to drink not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior of Jordan did a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">A few parliamentary election, the Islamist branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontal, Hamed Sinno, speaks of the cultural and traditional norms of the country, speaks to the country's cultural and traditional grounds of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press review of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN reported that the concert was "just" due to the sexual orientation of the singers.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim that the band's commitment in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free differences in the Arab world was endangered in the Arab world, which represents the old legitimacy of the whole region of the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou's Leila invaluable the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters," which continues to use "intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not easy to be sneyed by the rhetoric, but actually an even clear-out-crystalline reality in Jordan, however, is clear to the privileges.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib traditional Gender anmen came to Leibe, having formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vorehelper sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a apparently unknown woman whose arms and legs were up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who are actually confidence.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past years, the number of 'honorary morde' took place - the unofficial outside in Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch reached its climax. however, the number of honorary infrastructure reached their climax in 2016, however, the institutional infrastructure is missing to support women who attempted to support women and domestic or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the crime effect from 1954, women who have been suspended in prison for uncertain period, "and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee of the family needed to happen that the woman is nothing happened.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs Music is pleased to announce great popularity and is well known for it, also not before subjects, who in his country have been a tabu in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib, at the time, his work is politically, it took place, however, that he can record his music, the full of explicitly claims to sexuality, freedom and opinion, is not able to separate politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, a man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I hit politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song named "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib takes the question according to the Palestinian identity in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs, which are politically active in the core.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, a verse is repeating in a verse:</seg>
<seg id="2131">You are free, and every other is it too. "</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market that can get in his words, "which you can get" - be faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He realized that hardly anyone in Jordan on the rights of gay, and readers speaks and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still held up in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordanic Online program ROYA to remember that his comments made from the context, turns off and his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without a cuts that was stretched, but was only a working version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that Intolerance on homosexuality did not say to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuthing, a poet of the eighth century, who still remained with his homoerotic poems today.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: when Abu Nuthing, who later should work on behalf of the calibre, was supposed to write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordan could not do it?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The actual problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled, too.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian Kingdom it is nothing new, that the government attacks on free differences, and the progressive votes will be brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service took several former government officials and members of the apprenticeship, with the accusations, they would have voiced on comments in social media about problems that related to the land of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the concert is Hdaib, according to the tip of the iceberg - the actual challenge is, a structural change in the next generation of Jordan's next generation.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, Mashrou'Leila is a gig in a row, but the way of progress - so it's hdaib - consists of slow, thought-thought and inner changes. it is certain that these changes have take place every day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also, of an Arab world without interinterventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He has not only dreamt about his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be using music, art and literature of a real and fundamental offences - and not caused by bombs, streams and in artificial kind. at least he hopes that he hopes.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the way, Hdaib will continue to pass and demise with the resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was given by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis reporting which belongs to the Aman as a student Fellow.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These great, extravagant soldiers are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is believed that there were a variant of Tanabata festivals, which are usually represented in August in many areas of Tohokus, and during a period of time today, in the northeast of Japan, in the northeast of Japan, in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to oblige the Knie.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to let us a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>

<seg id="2156">A joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organised a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (dictionary).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I watched the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two movers are just to see.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take trip to Aomori, the only truth - and it's a breathtaking way to spend his summers:</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, outer apparition and body are so important as in this history, as they help to promote the Peruvian youth from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hairdressers.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus major port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, in the vicinity of the historic centre of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where road raub and illegal drug stores are daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">One in April 2017, published that 51.5 per cent of the population do not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - how many other medium and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and safes are also the unusual hairstyle of famous sporting events such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Peru), led to that there are more normal citizen into the experienced hands of hairstyle which can give these complex hairdressings.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyle, which go to the extreme borders of fantasy and creativity, even has an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos" has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Here, experts get back to, who can select from them the excentralized Looks, as you can see in the following video (other videos to current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Education facilities such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, who found himself in El Callao, found here a opportunity to see their weapons against hairdressings and instead of bad advice on a hairdresser in the hairstyle that makes them possible to find out work.</seg>

<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the Beitrags, "Liebesmessage of guerrilla forces," which has published an international online magazine, Tea after Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here in a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write a love briefe to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more important, people who feel out, affection, affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was the question of the young Colombian activist Leonardo PÃ¡rraga by the foundation of Bogotart and Cristian Palacios on the campaign of Cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), the young people tend to sign up letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, her country was the site of a historical event and they wanted to contribute her part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (english: revolutionary Armed Forces) that forms the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was the submitting of peace agreement as so significant that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, before the column is still a long way, until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">It has lived for many years in illegal camps, many years in illegal camps, and around the clock have contributed to their weapons during the clock, and have to integrate them into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society in turn led to life in continuance and in some cases, deeper hatred of guerrilla forces, these now have to hold their ranks in their ranks and support it to build a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young column will close together and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And they did that they were too: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - Liebesmessage of former guerrilla forces to welcome them back in the society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla forces - that will then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letter to reconciliation was held at the World Summit of Peace Prize, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the people that we love, on Valentine's Day, thousands of love briefe, but those forgotten that they want to know much.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plane, he told, he told his love with people who needed his love with people who needed for urgent.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, which can now find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">Previously, the campaign were collected more than 2000 letters.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I have never thought that someone would forgive me'</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over at the Caldono Cauca region on 19 March in the Caldono Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo by the BogotArt Foundation, to bring the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were so on how they had done earlier in order to take the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time it received no commands, but letters full of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it is incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck, and everything that in between" says the political science student of Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a employee of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable event so:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After having responded to the letters, led me a former fighter through the camp of guerrilla fighter.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw one of the "Camry" (a kind of refuge in which the guerrilla forces living) saw, I saw a guerrilla with a bit.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I'm afraid to go up, because in addition to him on the bed was a MGL-pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Dornbracht sleep.</seg>
<seg id="2211">I spoke to him, saying, "hello, what do it just?" he answered, "I reply to a letter I wrote someone else.</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life, someone else has a little so nice, so that I am aware of. I suddenly got the cheeks with the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I stumbled him and put me in addition to the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was also tired of the war, it was tired of all the years of faithful companions, and he wanted to write this letter to this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never was anything else that the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the famine. "I have never thought that someone would be given for my error.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a company that is waiting for us with open arms to us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I've only learned about weaponry with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now in peace, I can learn many things and work in Dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">To start students and several leaders of the FARC on a discussion panel.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all up and raised up as a war, and the FARC were already acting in obscurity.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the FARC leader of the organisation, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process. now, where we have the possibility to develop ourselves with a political party, we can help to design the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a goal of this size, it's worth to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Those people came to hear, that never had never found out, and to recognise that people who were often seen as monsters, even people with beautiful feelings, who were shot due to their habitats and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, in which the country lives, does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it trroasted me that all people - who have killed, and so much damage, we could bring to us a smile and a smile can give us a smile.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of the town of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Kolumbianern was done that after the drainage of the storm.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always give people to attack weapons which are ready to attack the weapons, and allow for their rights to protest their rights. and this is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We run from the FARC on the peace, to a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all the defence of peace to - regardless of the race, religion, or ideology, all of which belong to all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word to make our post and bring victim, as we know from own experience that nothing is simple. among those who defend the life as the basis of existence, many trouble will be forthcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way we will give many obstacles, but we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Women had called a nurse.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two samples in my right lung wings.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which nurse were laid out - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, as there is still my male name, but the doctor stood, and put me to women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am grateful to him very grateful.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his BÃ¼rotÃ¼r, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasus name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But it turned out to be a good man out.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has gone full of me with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February, I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, stranger, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The shortfall, to send me to Chechnya to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They wanted to prove that I wanted to prove it out, by the streets of the streets, and others wanted to say that I have not changed in the official Television in Grozny and I say that I was not the same message, that everything was only Schlechting, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have KÃ¶rbchensize C - what would I say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family tries to move with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "You have brought a monster to the world, not only your family, but the whole republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can't stir in, because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and laid down a knck to the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbours and retalies were the neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, under the windows, a car with darkened glass windows and a numbering plate with 95 on the window.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened to the third time, I was clear that there was something that was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists, the numbering of the numbering - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the aid of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Out of safety reasons I want to give her name to me, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With its help, I left the country, but then a little unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still cannot realize how it was able to realize.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to my mother if I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it, without meeting, without ID, without blocking, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and took it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came to and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I plug the SIM card in my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother per Whatsapp, I got a message: "you would like to say goodbye to security, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you know. you know even your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still contact your family in contact?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: just with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we speak about the intercourse of sexual intercourse, but not the table is subject to Tabuary.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally Caucasus elements are still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I wish I wish to overcome this spiritual barrier, I can't be overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I believe that as long as my mother's life is, I will do my best to do it.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we do with the camera, I give me good effort to look like the person I remember from their past - i.e., to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that's very hard.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: know something about the present location in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For whom I had recent information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke with somebody there, one and a half month in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during the Ramadan did not be arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he finished a new shaft.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will concentrate on the family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So, my me, it is probably the relatives of relatives, that take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end of demand a proof that the so-called "honor" by blood Genugtuung.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now also pregnant men in this secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says, it was just very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, above all those who have no longer have relatives or the relatives of their relatives have been left to place the Kadyrow court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know they are held there, so they can present them as a terrorist.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say, "You should be brought to them," You will show your body in television and claim that they would have not attacked your village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">When these people, these people would not have gone, but targeted to radikalizing.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is now only a verge or have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just had to meet someone who was a half and a half month in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people had disappeared at this prison after her bart had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new of them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken you.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself taken when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, until now, they were not presented as a band that there was so far no reports. we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise you would not allow to shave these people?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know, whether these traceans and demonstrations of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I wrote my hair as long as long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that in 2003 I was already known in the great ny when I lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Scharia, I had never problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much more safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia wanted to take us to the "civilizations," we finally came to us into the stone's stone.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted; I had colored eyelashes, wearing a little tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Security Department of the Scharia has never found a hair with a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ahead of the Russian Theater in Grozny, there was a place where every evening, a whole group of people met for me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were stood, and the whole city knew of them; they knew why males, young people met.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a Redebeon: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Spotte not over the evil of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">One says it often to children, if that have fun across the crane.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply have closed their eyes in front of you, because they believed, you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">You never regrets me, never gearing and never defeated.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long he kept this grace of grace?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow appeared on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak in TV via Moral.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He didn't spoke about us by se, but also priority about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - we could see how people in the city began to change themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who had to gelelt and had eight, looked up upon once with Argwohn.</seg>
<seg id="2369">During the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time, when I came back home, I could see how the situation in the Republic has steadily swallow.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what is going to go right now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as cellars.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I did not have much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much too much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Besides, I still worked as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I have been responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicated with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We perfectly organize teetching, conspicuous, I begging them to the hospital and helfe them to get there cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have any cents.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered this man himself, when I forsessed to sealperte.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I'm Muslims and want to help people who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: bear a hijess?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So the nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Tschetschenen, who want to make you with foam before the mouth that there is no oscillating with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The daemans who have the cabardiner that have the Russians also; on the planet there are they - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I'm from there, that is why it's unpleasant, to listen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I did so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and during the Ramadan - live with men together.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many remember with Transies of men, men love, and they believe that man might be a family to make more intimate experience. but that's a Trugation.</seg>
<seg id="2390">That are two different things - two different types of the sensory, in order to be exactly what different settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin, and do not feel me for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I would like to personally I personally, but my last intime relationship is now longer than a year.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I haven't sad why - I just know that I am now I am.</seg>

<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the combustion engines had so strong that the doctors could no longer do.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority in August, and activists before the place warned that, even more men could take the life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month several other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayyed Falah Moussavi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a thing in common: it was all of the fathers fathers, which, due to the persecution of the Iranian government, hilates and undeable to feed their families and work on a secure work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is located in the majority of the Iran-living Arab Ahwazi community, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to make their life to the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In front of a century, the Arab Ahwaz was one of the autonomous region of Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power in 1925, and in 1925, the ethnic autonomy began to end up with Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In Ahwaz region there are some of the biggest in the next oil and gas fields as well as some of the most frequent and most valuable tips for the Iranian farming.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite this valuable resources, the regional economy continues only slowly, and the native population receives only little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and relaxation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime refused to produce the Ahwazi-Arabians workstations in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also has a variety of roofs, built water from the Arab areas in the Persian territories, where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are running.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to destroy which in the region, caused by dry conditions, as well as local agriculture as well as the fish and palm trees to destroy.</seg>

<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that particularly the unemployment has become more serious. the reason for this, a combination of a high number of Ahwaz has newly diagnosed ethnic cleansing and anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functioning and institutions do not adjust the Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi becomes access to working opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic political policy of the dominant regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs in order to destroy their lives outside of the home of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to hide their preferences in the ancestor to the ancestry, and to hide them, as even the Arabic name will not be tolerated, because the speaking of the Arab language or the Trace of Arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In view of the given circumstances which have to bear the Arab Ahwazi, the Human Rights of Human Rights, before the situation is explosive.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't have identical with feminism, even with the interopertionals."</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under CC0 Creative Commons-License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion that was written by Ayomide, and originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was subject to several discussions, where many different positions came on.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I don't have a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as an interactive feminized feminists - with Frust.</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonders, why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay well thought-thought-thought and social arguments before me, why I would be feminist and why we should be in general the feminist *.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women are still selling less money in spite of the same education.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation, if that's why they may need to make it with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women a global epidemic is.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards do not ensure that women, or later, in various areas of life, will encounter a glamserne blanket, and that discrimination due to gender, are still moving across the many different countries and faith.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am among them and I have twice double and threefold, among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And nonetheless, if I suffer from skin to skin, black women in the LGBTIQ community; if I mentioned one, like that of which we were physically challenged, a lack of feminist and non-verbal movement, many white feminists and white internal feminized feminists were destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, however, all the agree that women - are coming together to take away "their voices and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing" to sing the equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about sexualized violence is a institutional design, that we are exposed to black women on two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that, black women and women of other ethnicities and country of origin less than the white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The black girl and girls are threatened with a migration background of the school as the white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women are exposed in black spots and women with a migration background to be exposed to higher risk of domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want to connect all men, all men and all men. on the other hand, I can connect me as a black woman to take part in their heart, that refuses to take into account the sake of sex as well as to the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm afraid, and I don't forget to fight my affiliation in a white-feminist, which always fight me and numerous other black women and ever rejected.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sojourner passed away in 1851 in her speech: "I don't have any woman?" and I refused me to get a ideology, in which the black woman is a human beings, a human beings, and marginally.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I wanted me to join me at groupings, which also absorbing a seat to the cultural events of our seat and customs, to form their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will not try to try white women the importance of the overclock of skin colour and gender. some of them will continue to try black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to try out a recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intermittal feminism was founded in order to give women from different ways to give women from the white feminism, and is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I am going to join me of feminism and join me of feminism to join me and my status as a woman, rather than me for a white-feminist paradigma, that is hard to say that Intersekality is being celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before, we define black women to define our own ideas and put us into the split, which are made from us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, says: Reclaiming Ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: as we can do it), in which they are absolutely safe and in which the cultural, mental, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be consumed in which the black woman account.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and internal feminized feminists, Separatism and exclusion may be read that these lines are read about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In this paradigistic environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized due to my dark skin, due to my life, as part of this paradigmas.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment, in which my life does not translate, nor will be ignored.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following item is the shortened and modified version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" of Kurturally. the article belongs to the series # Porer Mujer (# Nulicheinefull) which was reported over the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to the protection of the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police force said, Ada BÃ¡ez, that she had nothing to have been forcible against Luis Balbuena, its chief partner who has become a violent company.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of its relationship, a little time have passed and the police said to become the acts of the acts, but more could not do it.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As a further woman Balbuena was found because of mistreatment, useful even the acute display of Ada BÃ¡ez.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second wife moved their ad back.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The Teufelden Prize of violence against women, is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women spend at once more ad, they do not receive any support from the Staats.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also dependent on the men depending on it. this explains why only 20% of women who admit the victims of violence should be victims of violence against the victims of violence.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Contents1 strokes and Statistics 2 Unvisible missions and a legal system, which is nothing inferior to nimmt3 metabolic laws: good approach, lack of strokes and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women are really misuse, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social research institution in Paraguay. "there are various data and reports that are not even ansatly ise the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">The numbers are alarable, however.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, in the district Attorney's Office 9600 displays because of domestic violence. at 70% of them, violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the advertisements in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 new ads because of domestic violence in the peace. here, 86% of the advertisements came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women that they were physically challenged, 55% of women responded by psychic mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2496">This statistics show, however, does not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayischen women's Minister Ana Baires are actually shown just a few of these criminal in Paraguay. "every woman who will be refundable in Paraguay because of psychic mistreatment, come 9 women who do not do.</seg>
<seg id="2498">On any woman who will be refundable for physical missions, come two women who do not do, "says it end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Because women's murder in Paraguay is not a own way, the criminal authorities can not be adequate, as many women every year are murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Between August and August 2016, journalists showed at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days died a woman due to violence.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible missions and a legal system, which falls nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she was named after all of their former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning she wanted to do not yet, but then but after. this should always be for getting worse.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana 28 years old and not more with Carlos together. but for two years, the psychic violence on the one hand, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe forms of violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would have been victims of missions.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I have read more, I thought that only women happened to subsizable, because they leave by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana took social media to report about the mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote contributions to Facebook, in which they described his opposition and various attacks during their two-year relationship, and told them that it had isolated from them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked him, whether he ever made his hand against it and refused, that his behavior was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen in such a long time of Carlos, and it wasn't earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost so when they wanted to say that victims of missions have at least a certain fellow-school.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who does not come from Paraguay, fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partner did it harassed.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo Creo ("I think you") that consists of women who are all in any way of missions.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can speak with other over her experience, listen to each other, and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">You do this what many others do not do: take the testimony of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias's case everything started with psychic mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Their prosperous partners may even be able to convince them that she was valuable.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias Advertisements were no support with the authorities and even from their relatives, she did not support their relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led to a trial against their former partner who developed into an unmistakable legal struggle between Paraguay and her homeland, in which it was mainly money, power and influence of their former Partners.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Gays laws: good approach, lack of implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws, which are very well, but not used.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The ad of missions is a way full of resistance and a struggle against corruption in the judiciary, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organization for women in Paraguay, also looks great problems with the application of the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On August 10, 2016, in the paraguayan parliament, a bill that was discussed under the hashtag # PorEllas (# FÃ¼ry).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non-eWeniger) are part of a campaign based on Twitter that supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law looks forward to explain Femicide on a stand-standing shifted to explain and harder, as it was already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">In some points the legislative text was changed in some points, by also the MEPs for the law that would be afraid that the way for decriminalization of abortions, which currently are forbidden in Paraguay are forbidden in Paraguay up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had provided that the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs, which have to carry out the victim of violence, even if they simply fit only display and receive a safe accommodation in the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective, if the legislature does not give enough financial funding for this purpose:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment was seen as a part of human resources.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a revolution must take place, so that violence is no longer regarded as anything Normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Who, in view of these facts, he is found guilty and carries out that the perpetrators "perpetrators are coming."</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to outfit so long display, until mistreatment is no longer regarded as normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On November 10, 2016, the law was adopted at the paraguayan Senate. prior to that, parts of the law have been changed. among other things, a passage in cases which had called for the partner in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes are going on.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The Section on the reconciliation was again seen as an opportunity for the Aggressor to attack his victims.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The cancellation of the words "gender," "political violence," and "sexual exploitation of" parts of the law, however, is considered a big retreat.</seg>
<seg id="2543">This article is the shortened and modified version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" of Kurturally. the article belongs to the series # Porer Mujer (# Nulicheinefull), who reported over the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>

<seg id="2545">Independent media in Oman have been exposed to the ban on a newspaper in Oman.</seg>
<seg id="2546">"this website was locked to read on the website of the banned newspaper Aamn" on the website of the banned journal Azamn. "</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than one year ago, the oman authorities have signed the independent Arab-speaking newspaper Aamn for their coverage of corruption in the Sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be imprisoned in prison where he served one year sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari, and Zaher Al-Abri were also arrested and transferred to court, but later was returned to court.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after he had passed his father, Said ibn Taimur by a state of state.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, the most important branches in the country: Prime Minister, Defense Minister, Deputy Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Defense, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>

<seg id="2554">The attack on the Newspaper Azamn, her closure and the appeal of three of their editors in the last year is a hard hit for freedom of freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper, which has been reported on corruption in Oman (a absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, chief editor of Azamn, was published in the newspaper on July 26th, 2016. in this it was made by corruption in the alignment and the composition of high-level officials in judicial decisions.</seg>

<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, before the Court of Maskat the first trial in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri was held.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court sentenced three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both among others due to disturbance of the public order, "abuse of the Internet" and "undermine of the state."</seg>

<seg id="2576">The continuous closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in Oman, the freedom of freedom was injured.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Other violations include the closure of the website of independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the country's first independent online newspaper in the country.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, image took place with his friends</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is only rarely or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that are addressed to the urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the demand on site-run medical research, there are two reasons: for one of the benefits of global health, many medicines and vaccines which cover the particular medical needs on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, Tuberculosis and malaria in the poorest countries in Africa, more than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the exploration of these diseases are a great problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists himself in Africa. a larger role of science and technology can only be promoting the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Research (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s at Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic was the first serious effects on the national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself worked on the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the most effective healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and over abnormalities of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaves: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results. supporting the most important national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just stared a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion about the important scientific science topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they distinguish themselves from those in western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we are only available solutions that wounds the wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2604">That must change, otherwise we will always remain the receiver, instead of them to be Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions, which we get, are often used in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does the financing and support?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is she sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or hard, it's suitable to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the United States and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">Projects are different well-funded.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It's hard to find people who come back or back here, for financing and development chances are better than in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are available in your routine research work, which had not previously had previously?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries. it costs plenty of money, continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it lasts months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools in order to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, which should concentrate on and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are necessary to special scientific training, starting at each age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer sciences, Big Data, exploration of space, the healthcare sector (non-transferable and increasing diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will be benefiting from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: you can describe the advance and cons of life as a scientist in Africa over Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often there are the limited speed, things to do, and the values have access to scientific expertise, which are here challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system, that magazines are only accessible to payment for payment (the so-called "Paywall"), limited also the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers will change global food production.</seg>
<seg id="2628">"" "this entry of Rachel Cernansky appeared on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton bred back in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredder, the first plant, which is by NASA astronauts in space and has been consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was only created by his own random number and the question how many salaries can get borders, limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he observed that more Salate was patented and that he could not use them for the breedings.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only available for individual varieties, but also for specific characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special rotor green or green leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past years, more such patents have been registered to more plants such as cereal or anti-fleet varieties. because of this trends, plant breeding, environmental contactors, and experts for food security around the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia tradition, Morton was still salad, he needs now to be more than ever since its work is always getting worse.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is when one would lie in a river a rock brocks, to whom I have shocked.</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we must now do that, but it is a split with the breeding tradition, "says he says." I think these patents have to go far too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when they hold a court, no one can stick to a new salattitudes, because all features already patented ". so he's so good as possible, and tries to talk about the characteristics that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and easy to use, not a material which is protected as a intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">In addition, he is connected to a motion, which is always larger in the USA and anywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" breedings).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS, red RÃ¶mersalat of the variety of Outredder in the "greenhouse project" the station bred and eaten there. there is also tested whether plants in space can be produced.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name is more so sounds as the movement would come from the IT sector, and not from the range of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open-source" seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" software and inspects the alternatives to urheberlegally protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to life in order to ensure that some species of plant and species are not being protected by intellectual property, and so be used for plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the framework of the initiative, shortly Ossi, US breeder can commit themselves to use that others can be used by them bred seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2647">It does not mean that they can do not make shops with their seed and sell it. "Open source" breeder allow to buy it to cross the seed, so it's not immediately lees - two aspects that are banned by many plant species.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dunes:</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor Jack Kloppenburg, a member of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member Jack Kloppenburg, are important for food safety and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds plays a role in larger coats, such as biodiversity, rights of peasants, control over the nutritional system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeder would try to use last but not only use little to use the seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "Open Source" movement is not employed with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented in order to achieve the presence of environmental sustainability in the global agricultural industry, but in August or September 2016, we would like to buy food and sustainable vegetables as well as farmers, should also know that the way is farmed up like this vegetables is cultivated.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritional values no seed is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative do not commit their seed to provide for their seed. hence, her approach is patented in contrast, seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argued that the future of food supply are endangered because the prize pool to be caused by the ever-to-use mental property rights to plant material, which is therefore likely to be restricted.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, the Director of Ossi, has found himself in her PhD thesis with genetischer's variation in carrots and its availability. it found that about one-third of all antitrust characteristics are protected as a intellectual property, so it's either for plant breeding, or not only useful.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, there are such estimates are not yet, but experts like Luby suggests that massaging plants such as wheat in still larger style is patented as salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of visibility</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so bred that they have targeted further features - from such that their taste or their color improves up to such, due to those they thrives in certain environments and threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for breeder is increasing due to more patents. genetic diversity currently, however, would be much worse than ever before, as the changed conditions are much worse by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto, that genetic diversity can be important and decisive for Monsantos activities. with a total of four genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture in the United States, the company is responsible for the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, she says, however, is the view that the intellectual property others promote "patents and" patents and the protection of crop protection products. "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow, as soon as the patent is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often help this instructions, with another method to come to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such a protection inhibit innovations not, but promotes them by the public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the different: 20 years to wait until a patent, which certainly does not need any innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for a long time to use plants that are to be adapted to the changed environmental conditions, they have lost the battle already.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main source for Morton is but that genetic resource has already been involved in general, and to continue to remain: "independent plant breeding, neither the time still remain the money for such formalities, and monetaries are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what we desire, and it's impossible for us, if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resource. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">A total of interference from Morton on the concept to patented plant features: "we are creating the characteristics not really.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants constitute them out of and as breeder, we finally have no idea how to do the plants.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding, in the US state of Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who bred a variety of species, bred his own values in it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believes to the industrial agriculture with great humor and monocular cultures, in which cultivation approach herbicides are needed, who shuts into its varieties of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is precisely geared. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that are in international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are) patents have to survive the most smaller seed companies, even without patents they reject them, or they hold it for expensive and therefore not worthwhile, or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent Plant Equipment Frank Morton searches in his breeding garden Salate.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo of Karen Morton. photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeder is patroned by plant patent innovative: "it looks like that I was able to produce new efforts to produce new, more than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need to do a new material for my catalog, because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years ago, "he says." with a patent it is 20 years before the competition, to make it very easy. "worldwide Resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the United States seem to be a leader in the "Open Source" breeding, the concept is spread over the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture") describes itself as a professional organization in the field of traditional foodstuffs, along with farmers and helps to meet new varieties to kill certain varieties.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports it, to "Open Source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation has been working on an "open-source" license which ultimately gave a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi-commitment to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Regulations concerning the breedings differ from the country, such as the Ossi-commitment is not easy to be taken to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive Committee of the European Union, the European Commission declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patented. thus, she speaks against the present practice of the European Patent, the patents have been bred on conventional plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not a law, but it is now to bring it to the governments of the Member States, to protect these new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organised a conference on "Open Source" by representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the "Open Source" seed movement and global trend towards the Pattern of Saattue.</seg>

<seg id="2721">Still unlocking the Egyptian authorities in the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government passed the web site of the network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documented human rights abuses in Egypt as well as the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook, which criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step, criticised the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The 'Network for Human Rights Information - despite this encouragement to defend the law in this part of the law, so it's never so important to do so. ANHRI confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted all of the people to overcome the Spering and do not work. we are looking forward to meet our task to meet our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered to block the first web site of human rights organization in Egypt, as the independent news magazine Mada Masr, arabic-speaking edition of the Huffington Post and Qatar, Qatar, called Al Jazeera network due to alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, there is also no access to Egypt's blog of the column and human rights activists Ahmed Gamal Ziada no access in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of Kolumba and articles which he is not accessible for Egypt in Egypt.</seg>

<seg id="2733">His article turn mainly on politics and human rights conditions in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook review, Ziada left the sperm through the government and reflect what this means:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs that blogs is very old, however, has been priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi. and even if the locks of blogs might not be significant for the world, it's not for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) There's them to give me the feeling of an siege to communicate; a arrest, a discovering murder, summons at the national Security Council, the sperm blogs, and any other web page, for whom I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proved that I did not plan for free. in other words, my words have the influence, if only for a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it for the item of articles to feed the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, after they have locked him, and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The muego down the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and expression (AFTE) the Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests in the network of different Internet Service Providers (ISP), amongst others orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE's documentation also shows the sperm providers, by implementing an internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th, we were able to offer how the sperm Web pages, that began to offer VPNs.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice shows that the government of the government, continues to block content, and to filters, on the Egyptian users could have access to Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation, in addition, the situation will also be made behind closed doors behind closed doors, so the Egyptian population has no legal basis, using them to go against this acts against this acts.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now, the question: how far is the Egyptian government is ready to go with censorship, and if they will be the next attack?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants are fighting.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Quite a day of newspapers in Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city of the country and home to numerous posters were discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">The 14-year-old was shot in school, "Evening's second day becomes a police officer in Rio de Janeiro," President Temans sends out 8500 soldiers from the army, Marine and Air Force, according to Rio. "</seg>
<seg id="2756">The economic wave in the middle of the economic crisis and in an established financial situation reached the highest level in 2017 in Rio for the past 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian Non-government organisation Global Justice, called even the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports how these are every day and this is acceptable to acceptable & # 8212; at least the manager of a local paper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">So, published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio-known newspaper "Extra" on August 16, the article "This is not normal," in which they were able to set up a new section called "war in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports about violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In terms of decision, the paper explained the paper:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to be reported on crimes reports which happen in each big city in the world, like the murder, Raub, sex, etc. Everything, which happens in Rio, will be published in the category "War in Rio." (...) This is our kind, to call: that's not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative to which we do not close our eyes before the ridge.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was divided on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper that this decision was no reason for pride, but rather a sign of the failure should be:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper to all over the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't even recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist announced that it will be controlled by the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 territories that will be controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial article the newspaper continued:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We is aware that a war discreet when he is broken, even if he can be broken, grausing of the police, which only rule, and then ask questions, too.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Schadet the name "War" more than they useful?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira are argued to call violence as a "war." this is what about the media's legal security policy could cause the media and could draw up responsibilities at the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - including Extra with an analysis of military rates in Rio themselves - in combination with unsufficient investments in personnel, education, and a historical and self-balanced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just his capital.</seg>
