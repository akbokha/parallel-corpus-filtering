this is James R@@ isen .
you might know because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times re@@ porter .
long before Edward Snow@@ den , someone wrote a book , in which he published spectacular , that the NSA would have been illegal to teleph@@ ones from Americans .
it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in it he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c American intelligence operation , in which the CIA was literally delivered to Iran for an atomic bomb .
if the crazy sounds , you can read it .
it is an incredible story .
but know what the chapter is not happy ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years , the government has determined against r@@ isen and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he was promoted to condem@@ n the symbol of the Government , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and condem@@ n journalists .
according to the first Constitutional Court , media will have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to use this right , if media does not get this information and if they can &apos;t protect the identity you can give it .
so when the government had failed himself , he did something that many brave re@@ porter had already taken before him : he refused , and said that he would prefer to go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go to jail .
but then , only days before the trial , passive exceptional .
suddenly , although they have been for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , re@@ porter and springs can always be hidden .
instead of sh@@ ears and getting to the statements , you could also do his digital foot@@ tracks for him .
and so , the investig@@ ators , without his knowledge , his telephone calls may wor@@ ried about his call .
the same as its e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit information , and even travel with the list of his flights .
in the middle of these information , they found evidence that they used to condem@@ n Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ ens to condem@@ n the source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama spoke to protect his attack , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the Justice has condemned more than any of the US governments against him .
now you can imagine how that can be a problem , especially because the government is down@@ gra@@ ded much of her work as a home .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security had been the result that a W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower went to an journalists .
so , we put the press work on the game which should be protected by the first constitutional effects , because the government has more possibilities to help all the government .
but the same as the technology of the government allows to feed the rights of rep@@ ur@@ tern , the press can use technologies to protect their sources .
even though , at the moment they may take contact , rather than in contact , rather than in the back@@ bone .
today , there are communication software that had not yet been written when R@@ isen had written , and it is much more secure as normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
one such technology is the drop , an open @-@ source development system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now working by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I work .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail to send you on a news website , as well as the Washington Post .
there you can also send us documents , or send us documents , such as in any ordinary contact form .
these will then be encrypted , and stored on a server , which only has the respective news agency .
so the government can not count more information secretly , and many of the information which they would like to request would not be available from vor@@ n@@ as .
it is just a small portion of the whole , to protect the freedom of freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments of all over the world are still new spy technologies that are all endangered .
it &apos;s to ensure that not only technology groups such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to bring abnorm@@ ality , it &apos;s just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower ,
over abnorm@@ alities at the supply of soldiers were modest and pay by over@@ filled hospital homes . or the next environmental workers , the alarm to inf@@ lic@@ ated waters of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ Street In@@ si@@ der , who warned us in front of the next financial crisis .
anyway , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes against humanity , but to protect our constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; April 3 , 2016 &#91; the &#93; &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that Rei@@ che and M@@ äch@@ s@@ men have published an explanation . &#93; This week we were issued by news about an L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the Italian law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of ha@@ v@@ ens .
we will receive a impression of how customers , banks and attor@@ neys to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a go and say , &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company .
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of news , how the entire system works , as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister is returned .
there is also reports that a leader of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad regime in ha@@ v@@ ens has ha@@ v@@ ens in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a track of $ 2 billion US dollars on Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin , has a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of people and others who wait for the next release , and will be revealed on the next release .
now , like the P@@ lot of a agency , or an John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems wine away from you , I , common people .
why should you go to what ?
but the truth is : if the rich and mix@@ es are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all taxes , then it means less money for key public services such as healthcare , education , streets .
and this affects us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few of them to hide their assets and wear -- something that we have been discussing the past ten years .
I think many people appears very confused , and it &apos;s hard to understand how this tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always always like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so , one company has a company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind these prayers .
it can be very difficult to understand criminal law and control authorities , as well as journalists and civil society .
I find it also interesting that there is less reports about this issue .
presumably because there was no prominent Americans that came in these revel@@ ations in this sc@@ andal .
now it is not so that there is no other Americans that hide her assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but through the principle , according to these tax ha@@ v@@ ens , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
we would have a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples to see the connections in the United States .
in fact , it is so that you need less information in some US states that needs to be found in order to found a company to establish a library .
this type of in@@ transparent in the United States has allowed employees of school districts , school children .
it has allowed to trigger especially suscep@@ tible an@@ tic tra@@ ilers .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all concerns .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks like .
how does the actually work ?
so we sent a susp@@ ect investig@@ ators into the offices of 13 banks in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators gave himself as a African minister , the susp@@ ects money in the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we sho@@ cked to us that all of our investig@@ ators made by our investig@@ ators , as he might be trans@@ f@@ eri@@ de his money .
these were all the meetings . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course the money was handed over to the money . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it is not going to have a single lawyer , the open investig@@ ators of our tra@@ ded investigations .
it is not around a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it &apos;s about how the system works , through the corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to tackle these , we must change the rules .
we need to change the rules in order to extract these kind of behavior .
that &apos;s all very f@@ aint sound , as if we could do anything against it ; if nothing could be changed ; as if there are always the rich and M@@ äch@@ e@@ tigen .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see that some things have to change some things .
in the last few years we have more transparency to see more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies .
the theme was political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has since been recorded at national level at national level , who really is behind the companies in Europe , and who will be controlled .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts that the US can leave here .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both legislative chambers , but this makes not the progress we would like to see .
we would like to see how this Panama &apos;s revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of ha@@ v@@ ens , as funds will be used to ensure more transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who will see if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind thick companies .
we need executives in the economy , which stand and say , &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for the business . &quot;
we need leading politicians that recognize the problem , and use it , by laws of this type of in@@ transparent .
together , we can end the in@@ transparent , which is now possible to finish this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ undering .
this is the story , as I was almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and in the car boot of a red Maz@@ das would be .
one day after I had completed my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a type in the red Mazda stayed and looked my things .
he bought one of my art works .
he was in the city alone and was just a road trip through the country . then he would go to the Peace scor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was tired late . I was tired .
while we paid the bill , I made the error to ask him , &quot; where you do you have to ask him ? &quot;
he did not even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know it . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , Mann !
what do I now ? &quot;
who knows the situation doesn &apos;t mean ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place ?
but I had just met him just ! he says that he would go to the Peace of Peace , but I don &apos;t know if he is really planning . I don &apos;t want to ab@@ duc@@ ted the car &apos;s car !
this is a small car room !
then I heard me , &quot; I have an air stu@@ ff@@ ed . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
a voice in my head said : &quot; ä@@ h , as please note ? &quot;
night I was in bed , I star@@ ed on the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what I was broken out ?
a game that fits in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got up such fear that I went out of bed , to the ten @-@ points to the door , and my sleep @-@ door has completed .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the work of art , which he bought by me , is now in his class@@ room . he is now teacher .
this was my first experience as hosts . it has changed my view @-@ angle .
maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood when stran@@ ds were sold , actually friends , who were only waiting to be discovered ?
people go to my air stu@@ ff@@ ed , it was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air fro@@ sted with .
we make a period of time , two years later ...
I &apos;m working on unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my fellow people , and the rent will be increased .
I learned that there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked .
I think Cre@@ ativity can make it possible to transform fear in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new co @-@ mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I watched with me . our apartment will stay at a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
&quot; &quot; &quot;
we created a website and founded as &quot; Air mat@@ rat@@ ory and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast . &quot;
three happy guests were able to sleep in the wood floors for 20 dollar .
it was great , and we also found it .
I &apos;m sure to make our cheese ham @-@ ham @-@ lin@@ ol@@ lah completely different because we made it for our guests .
we went touring with them by all the city . when we met our last guest and the door fell into the castle , star@@ ed Brian and me .
we had just discovered that we find new friends and pay our rent ?
things came to rolling .
my former fellow resident , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to find out if one might make a business concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we presented ourselves to investors : &quot; we would like to create a website to organize the people public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the species , whose doors takes you over .
via the Internet , they can invite foreign people to participate in them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the missile would be ign@@ ited .
indeed it was not .
no one who is still very close at Tro@@ st , to invest in a business , the stran@@ ger allowed to sleep in the apartments of other people .
why ?
because of the children lear@@ nt to know that stran@@ ger is dangerous .
if you have a problem , that you can find on the things that you can well . we could des@@ ig@@ ed .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we had learned that design has much more than just look and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned about how to design@@ ate objects , but now we wanted to create by the immense wealth , between people who never had never met earlier .
can design so something like ?
is it possible to create design trust ?
I would like to give you a cost sample , whom we trust trust .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force from you on your position .
thum@@ b high , when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I would like to inform you your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locking mobile phone on your left seat .
this silent touch of panic has now felt -- -- is exactly what hosts , if it open the door .
for the only one that is more personal than your mobile phone , your home is home .
visitors can &apos;t read your SMS , you can see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel that un@@ locked up a stran@@ ger to the hands of a stran@@ ger to the hands ?
most importantly the responsibility .
so most of the guests , when they wo@@ unds .
only from this reason , our company can exist .
just so , who has now actually Al Go@@ res mobile phone ?
could you announce on Twitter that he adds to the office of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones .
you now have experienced what kind of trust we want . I want to tell you some discoveries .
what if we have changed a small detail on this experiment ?
what if your dog will only be presented once again with his name ; if he tells , how he comes , how his dog or his children are hot ?
imagine that you would have 150 Be@@ ur@@ ns , who say , &quot; He really can really read very well @-@ locked cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you would have to give your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ done feedback system strength@@ ens confidence in this .
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people , negative impair@@ ments .
finally , we decided to wait to wait until both hosts as well as guest performances , before we introduced them online .
last week , we discovered something new .
we have conducted a study . we investigated how probably it is that people trust in each other , depending on how they are similar to age and dormit@@ ory .
little surprisingly , we trust the people at most , which are most unusual .
ever more differences are found , the less trust we trust .
this is a natural social life of bias .
the exciting will be exciting when one adds the reputation of one person -- in our case by berries .
if you have less than three Be@@ ur@@ sions , nothing changes to nothing .
but one has more than ten , changes everything .
a good reputation .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep root preferences .
moreover , we drove that confidence is dependent on how much man is in price .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
for example , if you &apos;re looking too little , for example , &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you get no answer .
how to tell us much , as for example , &quot; I have problems with my mother , -- -- will not be accepted by request .
so there is an optimal degree of off@@ ences , e.g. &quot; T@@ olle art works in your apartment ! I make my family holiday . &quot;
how can you create it with design , create these degrees to offline ?
we use the size of the text area , to recommend the correct quantity text . we also give tips to which topics should be writing a little bit .
our whole company builds on the hope that the proper design can help to overcome our privil@@ ege to overcome them .
to what we were not counting , the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay out this incident .
here you see how many people are entitled to our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredible much luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a demand , which had not been covered before .
for us , the business is just very good .
of course there is also times , if not everything is smoothly .
there were guests who devast@@ ated Part@@ ys celebrated and devast@@ ated people .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than those calls . it does already I think when I think .
the dis@@ appointment which you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers , and is always our biggest motivation to improve us further .
fortunately , of the 123 million over@@ nights , only a small fraction is only a problem .
the confidence is right in each other .
if confidence works , can be wonderful .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his hosts drove him into the hospital .
he also ended blood for the needed operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to mar@@ gin@@ ate activities on heart attacks .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are genuine protected gel that save a life even if they don &apos;t know yet .
you drive one in your own car in the hospital when you die , and wait for a b@@ ypass tube .
because they don &apos;t want to feel it , bring the books .
you can leave even longer , without the extra charge is calculated without any extra charge .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , doesn &apos;t work every stay .
but this relationships among the pure monetary policy are exactly what you want to achieve with the Sh@@ are Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked me :
how fits the thought of part with monetary policy ?
it &apos;s a economic trade here .
but it is now just a &quot; rental industry &quot; and it is not necessary to do it .
Sh@@ are Economy describes a trading , the human relations .
people put a portion of itself , and that changes everything .
if you &apos;re travelling today , the Fast food is to compare it . it is efficient and reliably , but it is not authentic .
what would , however , if traveling a rich buffet of local entries would be ?
what would be in every place to visit one group there , a group there would be to be able to hold a group there and a pub in a pub that has never heard , of which one has never heard .
or if you want to learn from a five star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would shape the apartments from the reason to be used for mer@@ it ?
how would look like this ?
what would be , if cities would have thought out of joint venture ?
I work on me , giving us society and relations , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and amor@@ tis@@ ation .
in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking places , which belonged to the government .
now , the inhabitants were offered . students who were looking for a lead was :
people were conve@@ yed to humans , whose children were moved out . there were incub@@ ation programmes .
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Sh@@ are economy . over our platform alone will be 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries , by a stran@@ ger or even hosts .
the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be crazy about how it was brought us .
we have not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality was also previously mentioned before .
there were already similar websites for us .
so why has just worked ?
apart from luck and Tim@@ ing , we recommend that you can find the correct design with the components of the confi@@ dential design .
design can help us to overcome deeper progress .
I found the astonishing ,
in fact , overwhelming , overwhelming .
I have to think about any time , if a red play goes over me .
we know that design can &apos;t solve any problem .
but if we could help us , if it had this great influence , I ask me for what we can soon use design .
thank you .
what do you think when you see me ?
a believers do ? a Exper@@ tin ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ resses , a brain la@@ undering ?
or simply delay one delay at the airport .
this is true .
I give you the debt to your negative impressions .
thus , the media people who look like to look like me .
one study showed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims were negative .
studies show : the Americans thought that most would do not know Muslims .
presumably the people don &apos;t speak with their u@@ ber drivers .
for everyone who have never learned a Muslims , it is great , you meet to meet them .
I tell you , who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee of coffee -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am married ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I was a practic@@ ing , spiritual muscle in .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not so born .
I decided to do with this .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ sted me .
no , not as hom@@ osexual man , like some of my friends , but as Mus@@ lim@@ in . I decided to bear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
my fem@@ ini@@ sts were de@@ composed : &quot; Why do you decide yourself ? &quot;
the Lus@@ it@@ ant was : at that time , there was a femin@@ ist independence of independence , which I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt a perfect and un@@ achiev@@ able beauty .
I haven &apos;t just received the faith of my parents .
I have done with the Koran .
I read it , thought out in question , turned into question , and he believed that .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow de@@ vo@@ tion , which together with any reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of the Rhyth@@ mi@@ k takes me sometimes to wines .
I felt myself myself therein . I feel that God knows me .
had , you ever had the feeling that someone takes you , you understand , and does not love them ?
it feels like that .
later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
I later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then the terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly what they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , at the end , looked at the screen and looked on the screen , and saw the word &quot; Express message . &quot;
since , smoke , aircraft flew in buildings , men and buildings from the buildings .
what was the ?
an accident ?
technical error ?
my shock absor@@ bing fast in indi@@ gn@@ ation .
why should you do something like ?
I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; the Muslim terrorist ... &quot; ... &#91; ... &#93; in the name of Islam ... , &quot; ... ji@@ had ... &quot; ...
Oh , my God .
it is not only my land , but in the N@@ u , the deeds of others came into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the United States to go into a new city and begin with the foundation .
I recall that I am -- when we drove me -- deep it went into my seat in my seat , and I saw me the first time he was to be recognised as Mus@@ lim@@ in .
we moved in this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then , I saw , and read the war@@ fare of national Islamic organizations that might know : &quot; be w@@ aking , &quot; Sei@@ d auti@@ ously , &quot; lead in good lit areas , &quot; &quot; Ver@@ sam@@ mm@@ et you don &apos;t . &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
then it was last Friday in the week -- the day , participated in Muslims to B@@ eten .
and again the war@@ nings : &quot; does not go to this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I looked the extensive coverage of reporting .
the feelings were under@@ stand@@ ingly , and I heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who were Muslims arrested in Free Free and struck them .
there were really Bran@@ dan@@ ette to Mus@@ een .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something was not really correct .
the people who had attacked this land , attacked our land .
I noticed the people of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also ra@@ ged .
it is not easy to explain how to explain himself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually say people , &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when we will do it ? &quot;
some people want to serve Muslims as well as Mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like from a tumor in the USA .
it is only the question : we are malign@@ ant or good ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumor removed as a whole , and a good tumor keeps man only under observation .
the alternatives are sin@@ us@@ eless because the question is false .
Muslims are Muslims like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are inventor and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ fer and Olympi@@ oni@@ ken .
becomes the closure of Mus@@ een America ?
maybe a few parking , but not the terror stop .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to consider people of more toler@@ ant , and even greater civil staff .
and how to me a head of the police in the Washington DC area , DC have recently told : people are actually not in Mos@@ ques .
they will be radi@@ ated in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
when the Radi@@ ating process has been revealed that it begins online . as a result , the person is believed to do so that the person believes that the terrorists can be the true Muslims , and everyone who say their behaviour and their ideology may have fallen by faith , or by faith .
if we want to prevent Radi@@ ation , we must stop people to go to the Mos@@ que .
some of them are still claim that Islam was a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS its brood @-@ brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as Mus@@ lim@@ in , as mother , as man , I think we need to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we will add ourselves in her suburbs , when one recogn@@ ises them as a representative of 1.6 billion faithful .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology in their &quot; Holy book &quot; on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
but if you have a look at it , they don &apos;t know what they do in her &quot; Holy Scrip@@ ture . &quot;
it is its brood @-@ quality , which they can read these things in the Scrip@@ tures .
an excellent Ima@@ m told me a remarkable history :
a girl came to him , because she is a way to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him whether they have been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said that this problem was exactly the opposite . every cler@@ gy , with whom she had spoken , she brought her to the silence , saying that her anger was in the world , she would only bring in trouble for the ini@@ quity in the world .
inspired by nothing , and something that had been given to her we@@ ut sense , she was a key goal for the instrument@@ alization of the extre@@ mi@@ sts who responded to a solution .
this Ima@@ m sent the connection to God and the church again .
instead of acc@@ use them to acc@@ use her W@@ ut , he showed her design way for a real change in the world .
so what they learned in the mosque , they made it to join the IS .
that was an insight , like the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family concerns .
but how does it works on normal Americans ?
how does it works on any other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day on our actions of thought ?
a study -- actually several neu@@ rosci@@ enti@@ st studies -- show : if we are afraid , happen at least three things happen .
we accept more an authorized government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows that when people were forced , in which negative about Muslims reported in which they were more military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the rights of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you look at the mood against Muslims in the top of the river -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then last three times , but never happened in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the lead before the war and during two elect@@ oral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to the Mos@@ lem terror as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to support the foundation of an open society , which were reasonable and well informed citizens .
the dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we might see it perhaps the first , but the toxic air of fear .
in the assignment of collective education , it is not only about to explain himself .
De@@ ah and his wife Yus@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athlete .
he was involved in the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , much more ...
his sister would say to me that he knew of the sweet@@ est , more generous man who knew them .
she visited him , and he found her life @-@ run . she was amazing and said :
&quot; when is from my bre@@ eze , such a young man ? &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ zanne with her brother and his wife , she was murdered , just like the sister of Yus@@ or , Raz@@ or who was in the afternoon , as during one execution after he had directed against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight time on De@@ ah .
Fan@@ ati@@ smus may not only be im@@ moral , but also mort@@ ally .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we walked to the Mos@@ que or so we stayed at home ?
we did not pra@@ ying it and for us , it was not a slight decision , because we went to our children , saying that we had to control ourselves by fear , or one that we can do our religion .
we decided to meet us for the mosque .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we went up with high @-@ pressure to the Mos@@ que .
I took him out , and my shoes went out , went into prayer , and what I saw me .
the hall was rest@@ art@@ ed .
then the Ima@@ m sent a announcement , thank@@ ed our guests , because half of the meetings were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , A@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who were come to attack , but to us .
at that moment , I collapsed .
these people were there because they were courage , and comp@@ assion and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what do you choose ?
what will you choose the moment of fear and fan@@ atics ?
will you go to number safe ?
or you will be connected to which my : we are better than those who are .
many thanks .
thank you !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you have to hit a Ner@@ v .
but I ask me , what you ask me , perhaps you say that you &apos;re looking for a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a memor@@ y@@ urt with deep @-@ course , i.e. an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t know it . I am completely normal .
no exception . I have no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am so usually , as it is allowed .
if one can look around the Muslims on the whole world , and I did it with the largest ever conducted study on the Muslims in the world , people want to know people .
they want to live prosperity for the family , they want to live and live in peace .
so , I have no exception in any regard .
if people are usually appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception of the rule .
H@@ W : thanks . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for Bast@@ ler , it stands shortly before , to be a her@@ ring business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial drug dr@@ ones . possible , the research institutions are possible worldwide .
before the air package deal in our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of flight machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built up a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago she began to fly with bars .
by comparison , flight machines achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
you can also build a self @-@ resistant structures .
you have learned , loads of loads , go with tur@@ mo@@ il and react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possibility in the autonomous flight .
in order to make a system autonomous , it must know it collec@@ tively know where the mobile objects are in space .
in our lab at the ETH Zurich we use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic t@@ tasks .
we use a new loc@@ aliz@@ ations of Ver@@ ity Studios , an extradition of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands are available on top eb@@ e. e. g . &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight unit , which tries to beat two F@@ lies with a folding fla@@ p .
like other Star@@ mal@@ gl@@ ers it is efficiently efficiently efficiently , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
contrary to most of the starter , it can be Swedish , so it has great benefits from start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a bowling page .
a limitation of rear @-@ rigid is that they react sensi@@ tively to tur@@ mo@@ il like wind@@ b@@ ö@@ en .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight machine doesn &apos;t reach the optimal position in which the performance can be improved and improved performance by exercise .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves a lot of abstract questions that perme@@ ate to the core of the thing .
such a question would be for example : what is the small number of mo@@ vable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to answer the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known about as machines with a thousand @-@ mo@@ vable parts that refer to injury .
decades prior to decades , trained pilot @-@ controlled flight machines were flying , which had only two mo@@ vable parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear engine .
recently , we discovered that F@@ lies with just one work .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner ® , the mechan@@ ically sim@@ pl@@ ung@@ ed flight device . it was invented by short .
it only has a mo@@ vable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no folding , Schar@@ ni@@ ere and Quer@@ ru@@ der , no other pitch or counter surfaces , only a prop@@ eller of prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , it happens in the inside life very much , so it can move stable , and move in the room .
nevertheless , it doesn &apos;t have to bring out the rear algorithm used by the rear . to get there , I must find it exactly right .
the chance to look at exactly right if I would like to look at it , so I show you a video showing the last night .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ an information is a exercise in gene flow , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight Prop@@ ell@@ ers , a exercise in over@@ flow .
what do I do with all this over@@ flow ?
you &apos;ll see that he is only symmet@@ rical .
this is why he is a ambi@@ ence in his orientation .
as a result , he receives the most successful capability ,
in room to move in all directions , no matter what it is filmed or even like it .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight Prop@@ eller .
some is possible in models , the rest is directly connected when flying .
see us we see at the same time .
if air@@ planes should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliably .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller machines .
this turns into clock@@ wise
and the other against clock@@ wise sense .
if one builds up together , they are like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something wrong is wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , if also limited .
we will demonstrate that , we will demonstrate half a flight .
the last demonstration was investigated .
the greatest number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took the normal micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- any individual weighs less than a disc bread -- and out@@ fit them with loc@@ alization technology and algorith@@ ms .
each unit is white , where in the room it is controlled and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully you &apos;re doing this demonstrations , to think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine da gl@@ ands want to be a f@@ aint Lamp@@ en@@ umbrella on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for the types as of us is the salary of the development and the Schaff@@ ens@@ ity .
it is as a memory , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that there is creative , wise ways , they allow them to form a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has been such a massive and economic potential , is the Tü@@ zen on the i .
many thanks .
a very far distant gal@@ axy below 1.3 billion years ago in a very far distant gal@@ axy , two black holes are still qui@@ cker , they made a mass of three probe in a ten tel@@ ec@@ er@@ kunde in pure energy .
this short moment , it lit brigh@@ ter than all stars together in all gal@@ axi@@ es of the whole universe .
it was a very large Kn@@ all .
they did their energy , but not in the form of light free --
we finally speak of black Lö@@ ger .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time feelings and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ation .
we would like to bring the events at first time .
approximately 1.3 billion years ago , it was just more recent life on Earth .
since then the earth has been a lot : coral , fish , plants , Sau@@ rier , people , and -- God arise with -- even the Internet .
some 25 years ago , Ra@@ i Weiss decided to build a group of particularly brave -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of the C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser det@@ ector in order to search for free with col@@ li@@ zing black holes .
most of them held them for crazy .
but enough people called them as crazy genius , so the U.S. National Science Foundation has financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely much hard work they built the Det@@ ector L@@ IG@@ O : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ rics Gra@@ vit@@ ation @-@ Ob@@ servatory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O could significantly increase the performance of L@@ IG@@ O .
so , it &apos;s called Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
at the beginning of September 2015 L@@ IG@@ O started to clari@@ fy some smaller , hard @-@ looking problems to clari@@ fy problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the Det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ation @-@ shafts of both col@@ li@@ ous black holes caused by the earth .
they went through and me
and through the Det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the say good@@ bye to my to@@ ise &apos;s father .
basically , the fruits of my life plant .
all this , for what I had worked , is not longer science fiction ! AA : that &apos;s my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been research@@ ed with Ob@@ servat@@ ories as well as L@@ IG@@ O meas@@ ur@@ able signals .
a gra@@ vit@@ ation wave is a crow@@ ning in the feelings of room and time .
when taking the shaft of the shaft , the room and its entire contents will be moved into one direction , and into the other stri@@ pes .
to implement Do@@ es in courses for re@@ charging theory often have an right al@@ ber@@ ed dance .
&quot; de@@ able and dust , de@@ able and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ation shafts extremely weak , even ridi@@ cul@@ ous , are ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
on September 14th , for example , everyone was de@@ posed by us at the waves of the waves and gest@@ ure . the expansion of an average person was 10 high @-@ 21 .
this means that 20 zer@@ oes after the Com@@ ma followed by one 1 , the L@@ IG@@ O employees explained the L@@ IG@@ O employees .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser Det@@ ector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length should be measured at less than a thous@@ and@@ ths of a radius of an atomic s exactly . this is grot@@ esque .
at the end of its classical text via gra@@ vit@@ ation
described ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves in this way : &quot; the technical difficulties of the construction such a det@@ ectors are ra@@ zed .
but physi@@ cist are fin@@ alist and with the support of the public , iss to overcome all obstacles . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott claims that L@@ IG@@ O should be more ear than one eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around : facial features , the size of your mobile phones .
that is quite practical . for so , you can use a picture or a card of things that you want to get around the light of several points .
it is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
that &apos;s why it is very hard to manufacture a picture of things that do you mean especially :
about the face of your child .
instead , we went according to certain features such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close to the story behind .
&quot; now speaks in Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob &quot; breaks her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the number Bob . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ation shafts .
we can do not produce an easy images of objects in all .
but by looking at changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to us their stories .
at least there are the measured frequencies for L@@ IG@@ O .
so if we convert the shaft pattern in Sch@@ all , we can hear the All literally .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation of lau@@ ght , can us roughly much about the coll@@ ision of two black holes when my colleague Scott have already been very busy .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , zir@@ cons are simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two body very quickly , you can find the same zir@@ cons with an additional sound changes . this sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu :
it is a kind of motion modes , shaped like the wave form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date which , at least I never forget to hear this as a device by -- SH : ... two black lu@@ gs with 30 @-@ time solar mass , that &apos;s about as fast as the bars of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : we are superior to us what this means .
two black holes that are the most densely body in all , one with a mass of 29 son@@ nen , the other with a mass of 36 son@@ nen , among whom one hundred times a second , before they &apos;re col@@ li@@ de .
imagine the forces before .
fantastic .
and we know because we have heard it .
therein are the constant importance of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O eb@@ net has a completely new way to explore the Al@@ ls , as it was never before .
on this way we can hear the All lau@@ gh and the invisible .
much in all , we can see -- practically or basically -- not to see .
a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why the entran@@ ces stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . from them we have learned a lot about all of them .
but the exciting physical processes happen at the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon , and silicon hi@@ des .
we will never see , since this op@@ ak are never seen .
gra@@ vit@@ ation waves are penet@@ rating iron , when it would be transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minute of the Al@@ ls , but we will never see , since the pri@@ ck@@ all can cover his own re@@ fl@@ ashes .
using gra@@ vit@@ ation waves it should be possible to look back until the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that we have never seen that we have never seen that we will never see , and of which we have not have a show . things we only discover that we will not discover .
in fact , L@@ IG@@ O found equal to the first time of things that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars , the black holes , as L@@ IG@@ O they observed , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes were to say to the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work .
L@@ IG@@ O enables us to make a completely new look at the events in All , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of that chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be so brave as possible .
we know , thanks to L@@ IG@@ O , we know how to build a great det@@ ectors and cir@@ cus of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new Ob@@ servat@@ ories - a whole new generation of Ob@@ servat@@ ories on Earth and All .
what could be more beautiful than the pri@@ ck@@ all himself ?
now the time is great dreams .
dreams come with us .
thank you .
some time ago I had a experiment .
a year I would expect to all &quot; Yes ! &quot; before I was afraid .
anyway , whether it made me nervous , me in un@@ pleasant situations , I wanted to say &quot; Yes &quot; to say .
wanted to speak to the public ?
yes , but yes !
wanted to live live on television ?
yes , but yes !
wanted me to play with the show ?
yes , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I feared me , elim@@ inating my fear .
my fear , spe@@ eches , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , weg .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my life has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a particular Yes that could change my life in a un@@ expect@@ edly manner . it started with a question of my mini .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the small , calls for un@@ explained reasons , &quot;
as if they were a cellar in the South .
&quot; Evalu@@ ator , I needed milk for my Schn@@ abel@@ t@@ asse . &quot;
she once asked me to play me whether I was with you , when I was just on the jump , and I said , &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life &apos;s setting in my family . from there I am going to play with them , as soon as you do with it . no matter what I do , or when I am , I say , I say Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am rel@@ essly me very much .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : just before short , I was actually complete that the &quot; Yes &quot; S@@ agen for playing with my children my career .
I have a true dream job .
I &apos;m author . I think myself things out of , try out to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a titanium .
dream job .
I have creative television . I produced television .
I am television , in large style .
in this TV @-@ season I am responsible for a 70 @-@ hour program into the world .
four TV @-@ programs , 70 hours TV . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
every shipment provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist .
the budget for a episode of a TV channel can lie between three and six million dollars .
say we are five .
a new episode all nine days spent four shows , four TV channels , 70 hours of TV , three programmes , which simultaneously hold in production , are four times a week : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes of Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series will run on Thursday evening .
throughout the world , my series is in 256 regions for 30 million viewers .
my brain is globally , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are prepared , which I have created it , and not only produced , so I &apos;ll find time to talk about my fans , to gather my fans and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , wareh@@ ouses , which are burning around the world .
do you know that ?
no one , therefore I am a titanium .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to print you in mind .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; Author &quot; falls .
I say it to you , if you are interested , if you say a company , a country or a class@@ room , I don &apos;t understand that I am not only about computer and imagin@@ able , and it &apos;s true if I say , I understand that there is not a dream job in a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , everything work , everything reality , all blood , all silence -- no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m engaged in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work is always a country from the Nich@@ ts .
it is , when I troops on , when I painted a canvas .
so , one has a very high tone , but this is a marathon .
it feels like Be@@ y@@ onc@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love it .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , ar@@ du@@ ous and in@@ fusion , funny and un@@ disturbed , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and more reasonable , and the best of them is the Sum@@ men .
there is a change in me when working well .
a sums begins in my head , and it grows and growing , and the sums of the sums are like a busy road , I might go for ever .
many people assume , when I inher@@ it the Sum@@ men that I am writing , that the writing is preparing to me .
do not understand me , this does her .
but the Sum@@ men -- when I began working with the television production when I began working and work to work , create and work , discovered this thing about this sums , this energy .
the Sum@@ men is more than the writing .
the Sum@@ men is action and activity . Sum@@ men is a drug .
the sums of music is music . the sums is light and air .
the sums of God is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have so a sw@@ men , then you cannot wait differently than the size .
the feeling , not otherwise , as after size , no matter what the price .
the name is the Sum@@ men .
or maybe it also means a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps this is genius .
perhaps it &apos;s E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know it .
I know that I did not have the failure of the failure , and I know that I love the Sum@@ men .
I want to say you , I am a titanium , and I know that I will not plan to question .
in order to make one clear : the successful I will find out more on the more episodes , the more overcome , the more space , the more things , the more things , the more you see me , the more write me , the more than I find history , the more expectations are .
ever more I work to be successful , the more must work with me .
and what I said about work ?
do I love work ?
the country , which I weapon , the Marathon , the Marathon , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sums , the sums of the sums .
I like this sums . I love the Sum@@ men .
I need the sums . I am the Sum@@ men .
I only have this sums ?
and then stops the Sum@@ men .
excessive , excessive strain , burned down .
the sums of the sums .
now my three daughters to the truth are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single work institute .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um is not there , but you can write my neph@@ ew . &quot;
and Emer@@ son said , &quot; Evalu@@ ator , I want to go to Sh@@ onda @-@ Land . &quot;
it are the children of a Tit@@ anen .
you are baby @-@ titles .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the Sum@@ men heard .
the sums of the engine are hidden .
I love my work no longer . the engine was out of .
the sums came not back .
my sums was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same title of Tit@@ anen &apos;s work , 15 hours days , carried out weekends , no Reu@@ ben , nothing del@@ igh@@ ter , a titanium , don &apos;t exist , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever the same .
but there was no Sum@@ men .
silent .
four TV @-@ programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV @-@ programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show@@ piece of titanium ,
everything was gray , I had no fun more .
and this was my life .
everything I did .
I was the Sum@@ men and the Sum@@ men I was .
so what makes you doing , if that is doing , the work that you love , suddenly f@@ aded ?
I know how many do you think : &quot; Heu@@ lie@@ ve out of , blue of the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
but you know what to do you know , one teacher , one artist , Bill Gates , is just one another , and that is one of the sums , and know how to know the sums it , and know how to know the Sum@@ men knew that the sums of the sw@@ ans , who is it ?
what are you ?
what I &apos;m ?
I still have a titanium ?
if the song of my heart h@@ ears , I can survive in the silence ?
and then , my &quot; South states &quot; wa@@ iters will be a question .
I &apos;m sitting on the way to outside , late and they say , &quot; m@@ um , magic you play ? &quot;
and I want to say , I will say to me two things :
first , I need to say Yes , and secondly , they called me &quot; Evalu@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is the happens ?
I let it , if I am standing and my sums up , and here changes everything before my own eyes .
and so she says : &quot; m@@ um , magic you play ? &quot;
I say , &quot; yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
we play and play with sisters , we got them much , and I started most dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; .
nothing extraordinary .
but it is excellent because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and in the mouth of the Sum@@ atra , I can do nothing to fit except .
I &apos;m focuss@@ ed on .
I am silent .
the country , which I weapon , the Marathon , the Marathon , the army , the country , the high sound - they exist no longer .
all that exists , sti@@ cky finger and mo@@ cks , z@@ ew voices , juni@@ ors and the song , in which it &apos;s going to leave , or whatever the girl in &quot; Die Fro@@ zen Queen . &quot;
everywhere , peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so just that I am hardly breathe hale .
I can hardly believe that I am at@@ me .
playing the contrary .
and I &apos;m happy .
something I dis@@ sol@@ ves .
an mental door goes onto and an energy boost comes in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens .
feel it .
the Sum@@ men comes slowly back .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is since .
not the sums , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel me , I would know a magic mystery .
but let &apos;s stay in the case .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no mystery . not love .
it &apos;s something that we have forgotten .
the sums , the work men , the Tit@@ an@@ ens@@ um , that is only the replacement .
if you qu@@ ery , if I tell you , if I am to tell you , if I am pressed out using broad@@ casts and TV @-@ hours and how working my brain is , I don &apos;t forget what the real sum is .
the sums is no strength and it is not work specific .
it is dependent on the joy .
the true sums is dependent on the love .
the sums is the electricity , who comes from the life of life .
the real sums it is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sums are ignored the pressure of the history , which leads to do di@@ gest tasks , anticip@@ ation and pressure .
the true sums is simple and original .
the true sums of God is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but maybe even led me God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
once my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I am doing so , so I can liber@@ ate me as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any debt .
it is law , I don &apos;t have any other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to hear the Sum@@ men .
wish I wish it might be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
games do not play ans@@ at@@ ly as well .
the truth does God ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I work always , for I love it .
I prefer to work in the workplace as a home .
this uniqu@@ eness is painful , because what a man works better than a house ?
well , I , I .
hon@@ est@@ ly honest , I nen@@ ne myself myself &quot; Titan , &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am what I am too , is none of it .
we ras@@ en in the garden , before and back , and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play Ball .
we cr@@ ushed Sei@@ fen@@ bl@@ es .
in this way , I feel mainly stiff , ab@@ sent and confused .
I always get to my mobile phone .
there is O.@@ K .
my children show me how man lives , and the sums of the universe .
I play and play , until I ask me , Why do we have ever heard with the games ?
you can also tell it ! let &apos;s always tell you if your child would like to play with you .
maybe you keep me for n@@ ai@@ v , for a day of day .
have you probably quite , but you can do it !
you have time !
and know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ show figure .
your child finds you less interesting , than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes with me until they were able to make something different .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , you will replace a Mari@@ enk@@ ie or K@@ eks .
and speaks my teen@@ ie daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more demand it not .
everyone can bring 15 minutes on the piece , even at a bad @-@ attitude !
15 minutes per piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no abra@@ sion .
the day is shortly : dinner , the children will be ready .
but 15 minutes are not possible !
my children are my chari@@ ties , my world . do not need to be the children . it is true , the sums up to place a place for the soul of peace .
it is not going to play with his own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can enjoy 15 minutes !
find out what you doing well .
find it out and store it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I try and I will make victories . friends meet , books , read the day --
&quot; if you &apos;re playing ? &quot; is a short , I got up , when I got my first TV show when I was playing a titanium in training when I wanted to thank myself more and more .
15 minutes at the piece , why not you want to go full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sums came back in my leisure time . the sums it seems , when I wasn &apos;t working .
work not without playing games .
it &apos;s time , but after a few months , a door opens up in my office . I listen to a well @-@ known mel@@ ody for me and my soul . she has led me to new ideas . I get back his way back . I feel it in full bre@@ asts and love my work again .
I like the sums , but I love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sums of the sums it is not ... more .
soap bl@@ ings and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
this is my sums .
the Sum@@ men of life .
the sums of love .
the sums of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am grat@@ eful for that .
it &apos;s me by myself , that I am a titanium , and I never seen a titanium , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes , too less work and more games .
and nevertheless I have everything in the handle . my brain is still working yet . my dis@@ bon@@ fires still burn .
ever more I play , the happy are I and my children .
ever more I play , the more feel I feel as good mother .
the more I play , the clear is my head .
ever more I &apos;m playing , the better I work .
the more I play , the more you hear the Sum@@ men . the country , the Marathon , the Marathon , the Marathon , the gates , the gates , the bu@@ ds , the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ men , the right , the right Sum@@ men : the Sum@@ men of life .
ever more I feel this sums , the more makes this unusual , stable , bare and new life @-@ feeling in me wide . less Titan - more I !
ever more I feel exactly this mar@@ es , the more knows I , who I am .
I &apos;m author . I think myself out of myself , I teach you to life .
this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this jobs ,
because a dream job should be too bad .
I told &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Tit@@ anen is no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
I am Neuro@@ sur@@ gin .
how most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human wings .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a severe stroke or after an auto case .
for us of Neuro@@ sur@@ geon , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain has , in contrast to other body organic , a very low capacity to self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a constant , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ sur@@ gin .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions by various surgical measures .
they are sure to have one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; Tiefen@@ hir@@ n@@ ity . &quot; there is an electro@@ de deep in the brain to affect the circuits of the neur@@ ons so that the neurological function is improved .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , who suffered severe tre@@ mor and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ cure .
the dream of functional Neuro@@ sur@@ geon is the restoration of the brain .
I &apos;m looking forward to this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to around .
with a little help , the brain can help themselves .
the story started 15 years ago .
at the time , I was leading the physician and working day and night in the not@@ ation .
often , I supplied patients with sk@@ ull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma .
they have to introduce that at sk@@ ull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ g@@ mat@@ a , the brain an@@ schw@@ ill@@ ful and the sk@@ ull @-@ inc@@ ting press has been said .
in order to save the life , you have to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure level .
instead you must remove a part of s@@ wollen brain cells .
instead , instead of the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse with Jean François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass .
what my I do so ?
we wanted to grow cells out of this tissue .
this is not easy task .
to grow cells from a tissue piece , it is comparable to very small children who are out of your families .
you have to find the correct diet , temperature , humidity and environments to be blos@@ som .
just that we had to make these cells with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François Hollande .
he looked at the scope of his micro@@ scope .
this was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like such a stem cell culture . with great green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you don &apos;t know from the bi@@ ologi@@ e@@ Books that stem cells are un@@ affected cells that can turn into each cell type of organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery .
we made a further fascinating observation of observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells stopped differently .
they slow down slowly and after a few weeks she died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , however , was different .
we needed long to understand how they came .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are hot dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have in our brain .
you can make 4 % of our wholesale rin@@ d cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they ensure the brain the brain .
but why they will receive us ?
we don &apos;t know .
we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , because we find it in higher concentrations near brain ab@@ uses .
this is not so safe .
one thing is clear - of these cells , we received our stem cells .
we are in front of a potential cell source , the brain is possible .
we had to prove .
so we decided to develop a experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass out of the pre @-@ speaking area and then the cells were exactly as cul@@ tured as it was Jean @-@ François ,
and they would like to mark the color in order to pursue them in the brain .
in the last step re@@ im@@ planted it was in the same level as the same name .
we call the aut@@ ologist Transplan@@ tation -- autograph@@ s transplan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we pass these cells into normal brain tissue , which will happen when we pass the same cells into sin@@ tered brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we observed the cells into a healthy brain and we observed , that they were taken from a few weeks when they were taken back , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be used there , so disappear .
in the second scenario , we had a violation of injury and re@@ im@@ planted the same cells , and now , the cells were given to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could see under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
proof of evidence showing these small points are these small points . these are the cells that we solved in vitro , in the culture .
we could not hear the course of course .
help this cells to recover from a brain injury ?
thus , we received monkeys with a manual point task .
they had to take food pellets from one tablet .
they made very good .
as they achieved a stable policy level , the last we had the mot@@ oring Cort@@ ex in the mot@@ oring Cort@@ ex .
the monkeys were the monkey , they couldn &apos;t move their hand .
just as it would happen at people , they re@@ covering up to a certain degree , exactly as according to a stroke .
the patients are yellow and then try to recover them with the help of plasti@@ fic@@ ated mechanisms . they can recover from a certain degree , just as with the monkeys .
when we are sure that the A@@ fts had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we had reached its own cells .
on the left @-@ hand side you see the monkeys , which arise spont@@ aneously .
it can be about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now you see when we re@@ im@@ planted the cells : the same axis , two months after the maturity .
I can tell you , that were very exciting results for us .
since that time , we have found much more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use later .
we can use them in other neurop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still going to be im@@ planted with humans .
I hope that I can soon show you soon as the human brain is going to he@@ al themselves .
many thanks .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I am sure now , several dozens of people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know anyone who need it need . &quot;
I definitely have any case .
of course , the question of what are the biggest obstacles , before you can start clinical studies on the people .
Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the largest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results you need to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this kind of studies .
BG : it is under@@ stand@@ able that the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and a professional team .
BG said : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried the permission to take the start of clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years takes you to hospital , and will be available to the hospital .
J@@ B : this is hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of clinical trial .
will allow us to allow us to start it soon ?
then one must perform this study with a small group of patients .
it &apos;s already a long time to select treatment and evaluate the treatment and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
afterwards one must use the multi @-@ center study on a multi@@ centre study .
you must really make sure that it can be useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG said : and that it is sure , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , thank you for your visit to TE@@ D and that you have told us .
BG said : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a great mistake they consider as of course .
we see the democracy not as the fragile plant , which is in reality , but as inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as un@@ altered ge@@ vity .
we believe that capitalism leads to democracy .
this is true .
Lee Ku@@ i@@ Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great after@@ mat@@ h in Beijing has proved that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth while the policy is fully over@@ threw .
in fact , democracy will be home to us in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the new Greek government -- the new Minister for Finance in the Euro@@ group -- the democratic process of our country -- our election -- not allowed to influence the austerity programs , which have been realised in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there might be no better legal for Lee Ku@@ i@@ Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party , or some of my conc@@ es@@ tically friends , which would be repeated , that democracy would be abol@@ ished , if they would like to change anything .
at this point , I would like to introduce a economic model for a real democracy .
please , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ i@@ Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save us the democracy , but that we require a truth and def@@ ensive democracy .
for without democracy , our societies have been carried out our societies , our future , and our great , new technologies are wast@@ ed .
on the subject of the subject , I would like to point out an interesting form , which currently is threatened to be threatened with interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the twin summit @-@ par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a peak is well known . you know and recognize it as the debt of the debt , which makes his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt of the debt .
but just a few recogni@@ zing its pl@@ illing .
a mountain of wast@@ ed cash that is , however , is to invest in it , where there could be productive and income , with which one could produce the debt of the debt of the debt , and all those things are needed to avoid mankind , for example , &quot; green &quot; energy .
I have two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the USA , in England and in the Eurozone , 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars have been invested in all the prosperity of wealth , such as industrial facilities , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , gain , equipment and so on .
3.4 trillion U.S. dollars has a lot of money , until it compar@@ es that there were $ 1 trillion dollars , compared to the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock markets and the real estate prices .
so , debts and lack of capital , the twin summit , which are not covered by the common market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages that would not invest more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year old in the United States , Japan and Europe , which will not invest exactly . just like Ö@@ di@@ pus Father , who might be afraid of fear that prophecy would kill him , if he will kill him ,
un@@ certain the circumstances leads to the circumstances that hat@@ ches him .
this is my hair with capitalism --
its extremely popular capital should be used to improve our lives , to improve human resources , and particularly all the technologies to finance , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the rescue of the earth .
is for democracy the solution ?
I think . but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the corporate form , to control the Free and the poor as a majority the government .
the ath@@ ic democracy joined of course in a lot of --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake , the job value of the ath@@ ic democracy because of these joints .
the decision of the ath@@ ic democracy was and said that they were not only sending the right to free opinion , but rather more important and a crucial role , that they gave them the right to policy @-@ determination with equal vocal weigh@@ ting into questions of the stat@@ utes .
the ath@@ ic democracy could not be held long --
like a cand@@ le , which is very bright , it is burned down rapidly .
however , our present @-@ liberal democra@@ cies have not their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the ath@@ ic democracy focused on the free citizens and the working arms , our liberal democracy were focused on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , who ultimately became a stat@@ ute for prev@@ ailing .
for the liberal democracy occurred only when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process on the policy was made , while the economy -- the world of companies -- a democratic zone has been implemented .
in our current democratic party , since the time , in which the separation of politics and economy began , an adverse struggle between the two , increasing the politics and con@@ fer@@ ed them .
are you wonder@@ ing , why the politicians did not want any more like earlier ?
it is not an de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is true that there are nowadays in the government , but not in power because the power of politics into the economy is washed and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is in about such a flock of smoking , the most sustainable animals , of which they are nour@@ ished , that they will be hungry by the end of the end .
similarly , it is similar to the economy by making the politics itself . the power of the concert is growing , political goods increases , the overall economic demand , and the managing director of the corporations are sh@@ attered to invest the cash of their company .
according to capitalism &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; of the democracy markets , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and the welfare of mankind .
if it is true , it is obvious that we must bring the policy and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; will hold your control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the absence of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left that idea had already been 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t really good .
the lesson of the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be , that the working arms was only caused by a miracle , as in the ancient Athens order , without new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : the working arms !
capitalism does it , replacing Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ hn@@ s by automation and robot .
the problem is that , as long as long and politics separate areas , automation of the twin summit will be higher , the waste of torture and social conflicts deeper , such as I think -- will happen in countries like China .
so we must make the economy and the areas of economy and politics again , and that we pay attention that we want to re @-@ use the re @-@ agreed area , otherwise we are able to appear in a non @-@ term hyper@@ auto@@ cra@@ tive , which means the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentation .
thus , the question is not whether the capitalism became the technical achievements that he has produced , survival -
the most interesting question is to be replaced by a d@@ yst@@ ro@@ scopy , similar to the people who serve the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; in which the universe was in charge of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long discussions with the meaning of life .
I think we are optimistic .
so what would like to look like it might look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; @-@ like D@@ yst@@ ro@@ scopy ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you a few examples .
in the field of companies : imagine an capital market , in which you earned money , while you are working and in your capital , you will be able to work from a company to the next , and the company -- regardless of which one has just been -- is the property of those who currently work in the company .
then , all income from capital , and rede@@ em , and the concept of wage work is completely over@@ taken .
there are no distinction between those among whom the company does not work there , and employees who work there , but the company does not include . no exchange rate between investment and work , no large L@@ aps between investment and savings , and finally not a temporary twin summit .
in the area of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies would have a free float exchange rate in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging markets &#93; will be issued in the interest of humanity .
imagine that all the world trade will be tra@@ ded in this currency , we call it &quot; The Kosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kosmos &quot; &apos; -- and every government pays off the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trading of the country , into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world , in which investment means are ra@@ r .
this is no new idea .
it is basically the fact that John May@@ n@@ ard Ke@@ yn@@ es had proposed to the Bret@@ ton Woods conference in 1944 .
the problem was that one had not implement the technical funds at that time .
today we have , especially in front of the background of a re@@ united politics and economy .
the world , which I mean you , is the same time liber@@ ties in which it is privileged persons , and mar@@ x@@ ed because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the history of history , and ke@@ yn@@ esi@@ osis , global ke@@ yn@@ esi@@ al .
but above all other it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will w@@ aking up in such a world
or we will drop in a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar di@@ yst@@ ro@@ scopy ?
the answer depends on how we decide to decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better .
thank you .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you wish to find yourself in your biography itself as the liber@@ ties Mar@@ xi@@ sts .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s Analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any what I have just said to be relevant , Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of Politics and Economy is ... T@@ un we don &apos;t think the technological development will generate a massive fall in the overall economic demand that Larry Sum@@ mers are called &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis in a part of the Earth , as we know it , it will not only be our democra@@ t dest@@ abili@@ ze , but also the countries whose interest is low for democracy .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , Marx is very relevant .
as well as Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I have a liber@@ at@@ ous Marxist and like Ke@@ yn@@ es , and therefore I am quite wir@@ l .
BG said : indeed , and now we are probably also well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t do so , consider not enough .
BG said : this is a very Greek , a kind philosophi@@ cal statement -- Y@@ V : in your talk about Singapore and China , and yesterday at the dinner of the Red@@ ner did you very clear what you keep from the point of view to China .
would you like to repeat here ?
Y@@ V : there is a big measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democra@@ cies , we have a democracy of democracy .
as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy to the politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the area of the economy - is a totally democratic zone .
in certain ways , if I can say the so prov@@ oking saying , China today resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- -- don &apos;t remember -- we tend to connect to liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is an error , historically relevant .
Liber@@ alism , Liber@@ ale , such as John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical , which concerns the democratic development .
what you can watch in China in China , resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now permits to do what the West in the 19th century itself has done , has ra@@ ping down to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG said : I &apos;m sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I noticed that this is coming .
BG said : yes ...
how to look back six months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , personal view , and very dis@@ appoint@@ ing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone .
not only Greece , but the euro zone ,
namely from the self @-@ f@@ ake to adopt , and the di@@ gesti@@ ble , that a massive shift @-@ line by the euro zone , and continues to continue massi@@ vely at the development of the European Union .
we had the opportunity to be on the basis of Greek di@@ vor@@ ce - by the way , the first sugges@@ tion was revealed to di@@ vest@@ ment .
it was correct to make it right . unfortunately , the moon within the euro zone , in the group , continues to continue .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you tried to get a economic system that is not viable , by policy will and performance guitar , you may have a while in a while , however , if the change happens , it happens to ab@@ rup@@ tible and destro@@ y@@ able .
BG : what do you advance ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future , if we do not change their structure .
BG said : have you made any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG said : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone , who look back -- Ern@@ sth@@ al ...
if it has a Minister for Finance , or any minister , who , after 6 months in the office , especially in such an established situation , claims that he didn &apos;t make a mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made error .
the greatest error was to sign an application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was a honest interest on pages of the money , a common solution .
but that gave it not .
they only wanted to bring to our government , only because they would not have to deal with the evaluation of the euro zone , who had to run the Eurozone .
they don &apos;t want to stand out that it has been a cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c program for 5 years in Greece .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the Tro@@ ika of the money that has imposed this policy was imposed this policy : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal@@ er error . &quot;
BG : in spite of all the aggressive T@@ ons of the talks , seem to be quite right per @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro zone versus , from somebody , the Europe lives and loves .
my biggest fear is that the euro zone did not survive .
for if they did not survive , the Fli@@ eh@@ of forces are demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this is not alone consequences for Europe cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c consequences , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the most powerful economy in the world .
if we are happy to enter the way of a post@@ modern 1930 , which it appears me , it will also be dre@@ aming for the future of Europeans like the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope very pleased that you go wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , many thanks , that you were at TE@@ D .
Y@@ V : thank you .
most of Roy Price have never heard , although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision to hit the Roy had three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a I@@ gel@@ da@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for this , shows the shows and the content you will produce the Amazon .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought sector .
there are already so many TV series that Roy can not have any select .
it must find shows the very well , very good .
in other words , he must find shows the right on this curve on this curve .
this curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation is shown from 1 to 10 and the height as many shows this review will receive .
your show with nine and higher is rated , this is a winner .
then one has a successful show .
that are shows how &quot; break@@ ing bath , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are ad@@ dic@@ tive , where one has left one season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there are more of these episodes ? &quot;
this type of show .
on the left side , here on this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should be enough to say that at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not decide to get on the left side of the curve , because I don &apos;t need special intelligence , to under@@ go &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts on the average output , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor po@@ or@@ ly bad , they don &apos;t miss it .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course , it is the first time that Amazon should make something like something , so that Roy will not plan anything else .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes lots of ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of this shows and represents them online where they can look for free .
and if you &apos;re out for free things , you are going to get right ?
millions of viewers look at this ep@@ iso@@ den .
however , they don &apos;t know that it will be observed during the day of this shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team , which will take part .
you may capture when you start the show , when one sees it , which parts will be over@@ thrown or again .
you will earn millions of data to decide with these dates , what do they produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process these and resulting from the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ Com via four republi@@ can US Senate . &quot;
they made this show .
someone who knows the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that do not remember that show , because it was not so good .
it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 , and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- therefore something about the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team had worked .
at the same time , another manager has given a top show by data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the Manager for Programm@@ ing of Net@@ fli@@ x . just as Roy is always in search to find this one Super show , and he is also using data , but it does somewhat different .
instead of a competition , he and his team have met the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , i.e. the evalu@@ ations which they give the shows , the course , which shows them like etc .
then , they use these data to find this small details about the audience : what shows they like that producer , which actors .
when they had developed all the parts , they went a car , and decided not to make a seat at a seat of four channels , but a drama series on a Senator .
know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; House of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 rating on this corner . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course this question is what happened here ?
two very kom@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed companies .
it connect this many data and it works super for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is the ?
because the logic is somehow states that the fact should work with everything .
if you collects millions of data , for a decision to meet you , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as Back @-@ Up .
it is optimized by very powerful computer .
the min@@ ous , what you can expect , is good television , or ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is a bit sc@@ ary , because we live in a period , in which we live and more to statistics , to meet serious decisions , far beyond television .
anyone who knows here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in this room ever in touch with this software . come in touch with contact , you are in prison .
if someone is in the USA in prison , and is asking this , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dism@@ iss@@ al is done or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide if a show is good or bad , it is decided to whether a person is good or bad .
medium @-@ sized television , 22 minutes , which can be bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results . this is not aware that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to get data .
also the data sealed companies are very wrong .
yes , even Google makes sometimes error .
in 2009 , Google announced that it is due to data analysis of flu out@@ breaks of flu , lim@@ iting species , predi@@ ctions -- by data analysis of the Google research .
it was functional and was a great news release . the success culmin@@ ated in an publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it works fine , year around year , until there is no longer functional ,
and no one could say why .
it was quite simple , this was once again a sensation , including the release of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google will sometimes be mis@@ understanding .
despite all these mistakes the data and decisions made in decisions of life a -- at the workplace , at the law en@@ forcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure data are helpful .
I also know many trouble with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics -- an area where some very strong people are un@@ usually using many data to meet serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years I have detected some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and non @-@ successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you do mostly do two things :
the first place to analyse this problem into its single parts , so you can analyse the individual parts . as a second , you set the single parts back to create a resolution .
sometimes you must do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to cut a problem , and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to take part in the parts and come to a resolution .
for this there is another tool and we have all : our brain .
if there is something that the brain is good , it is pieces of pieces and pieces again , even if the information is un@@ complete , if the information is un@@ complete , to touch a good resolution -- especially if the brain is one of the experts .
therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and understanding , where they also belong to the process .
they use data to understand their audience better , for which they don &apos;t have been capable of yet . but the decision , how to put all these parts , and resulting from a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which stood not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision to show what they meant a big personal risk with this decision .
by contrast , this was based on the wrong way .
they use users to control all their decisions , first as they voted on TV ideas , then as they voted &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a safe decision to say , because they say , &quot; tell us the data . &quot;
it was not the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things can go wrong , if data will begin to control our decisions .
no matter how power are full , data are only a tool to forget about this device is quite useful .
many of you are ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; magic 8 Ball &quot; as it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No question , you have to get only the ball into order to get a reply . &quot; highly likely , -- exactly here at this moment .
I will see it later with a technical demo .
I have so far hit some decisions in my life , where I would have to listen to the ball .
but , as you know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace these , through a bit of expression , like data analysis , to make better decisions .
but this changes not the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball matrix and sophisticated and sophisticated . finally , it is possible to meet decisions , if we want to reach something exceptional at the end of the right curve .
and I &apos;m very encouraging news that despite the great amount of data , there is still a number of data to meet decisions , an expert in which you do , and risks .
because at the end , it is not the data but the risks involved with which you arrived at the right end of the curve .
thank you .
