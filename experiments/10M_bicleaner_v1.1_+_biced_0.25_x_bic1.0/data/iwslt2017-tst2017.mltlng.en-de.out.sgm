<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before Edward Snowden, someone wrote a book, in which he published spectacular, that the NSA would have been illegal to telephones from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In it he describes a catastrophic American intelligence operation, in which the CIA was literally delivered to Iran for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, you can read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But know what the chapter is not happy?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has determined against risen and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he was promoted to condemn the symbol of the Government, Whistleblower and condemn journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first Constitutional Court, media will have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to use this right, if media does not get this information and if they can't protect the identity you can give it.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government had failed himself, he did something that many brave reporter had already taken before him: he refused, and said that he would prefer to go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the trial, passive exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they have been for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporter and springs can always be hidden.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of shears and getting to the statements, you could also do his digital foottracks for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so, the investigators, without his knowledge, his telephone calls may worried about his call.</seg>
<seg id="21">The same as its e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit information, and even travel with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the middle of these information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and Risens to condemn the source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama spoke to protect his attack, Whistleblower. but instead, the Justice has condemned more than any of the US governments against him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how that can be a problem, especially because the government is downgraded much of her work as a home.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security had been the result that a Whistleblower went to an journalists.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, we put the press work on the game which should be protected by the first constitutional effects, because the government has more possibilities to help all the government.</seg>
<seg id="28">But the same as the technology of the government allows to feed the rights of repurtern, the press can use technologies to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">Even though, at the moment they may take contact, rather than in contact, rather than in the backbone.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that had not yet been written when Risen had written, and it is much more secure as normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is the drop, an open-source development system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet famous Aaron Swartz, and is now working by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail to send you on a news website, as well as the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can also send us documents, or send us documents, such as in any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted, and stored on a server, which only has the respective news agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can not count more information secretly, and many of the information which they would like to request would not be available from vornas.</seg>
<seg id="36">It is just a small portion of the whole, to protect the freedom of freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments of all over the world are still new spy technologies that are all endangered.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's to ensure that not only technology groups such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to bring abnormality, it's just as important that we protect the next Whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Over abnormalities at the supply of soldiers were modest and pay by overfilled hospital homes. or the next environmental workers, the alarm to inflicated waters of Flint. or a WallStreet Insider, who warned us in front of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">Anyway, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes against humanity, but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[April 3, 2016 [the] "Panama Papers" revealed that Reiche and MÃ¤chsmen have published an explanation.] This week we were issued by news about an Leck of 11 million documents of the Italian law firm Mossack Fonseca.]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We will receive a impression of how customers, banks and attorneys to companies such as Mossack Fonseca go and say, "okay, we need an anonymous company.</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of news, how the entire system works, as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister is returned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is also reports that a leader of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad regime in havens has havens in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a track of $2 billion US dollars on Russia's President Vladimir Putin, has a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of people and others who wait for the next release, and will be revealed on the next release.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now, like the Plot of a agency, or an John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems wine away from you, I, common people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should you go to what?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and mixes are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all taxes, then it means less money for key public services such as healthcare, education, streets.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some few of them to hide their assets and wear -- something that we have been discussing the past ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appears very confused, and it's hard to understand how this tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always always like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So, one company has a company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind these prayers.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult to understand criminal law and control authorities, as well as journalists and civil society.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it also interesting that there is less reports about this issue.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there was no prominent Americans that came in these revelations in this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there is no other Americans that hide her assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle, according to these tax havens, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">We would have a data leck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples to see the connections in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that you need less information in some US states that needs to be found in order to found a company to establish a library.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparent in the United States has allowed employees of school districts, school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed to trigger especially susceptible antic trailers.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all concerns.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks like.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does the actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a suspect investigators into the offices of 13 banks in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigators gave himself as a African minister, the suspects money in the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We shocked to us that all of our investigators made by our investigators, as he might be transferide his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all the meetings. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course the money was handed over to the money. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not going to have a single lawyer, the open investigators of our traded investigations.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not around a single top politician, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It's about how the system works, through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to tackle these, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules in order to extract these kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">That's all very faint sound, as if we could do anything against it; if nothing could be changed; as if there are always the rich and MÃ¤chetigen.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see that some things have to change some things.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years we have more transparency to see more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme was political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has since been recorded at national level at national level, who really is behind the companies in Europe, and who will be controlled.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts that the US can leave here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both legislative chambers, but this makes not the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would like to see how this Panama's revelations, this huge insight into the world of havens, as funds will be used to ensure more transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will see if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind thick companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need executives in the economy, which stand and say, "Intransparent is not good for the business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians that recognize the problem, and use it, by laws of this type of intransparent.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can end the intransparent, which is now possible to finish this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was almost abducted and in the car boot of a red Mazdas would be.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I had completed my design studies, I made a backyard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in the red Mazda stayed and looked my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was in the city alone and was just a road trip through the country. then he would go to the Peace scorps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was tired late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the bill, I made the error to ask him, "where you do you have to ask him?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He did not even worse: "I don't know it."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, Mann!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who knows the situation doesn't mean?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I had just met him just! he says that he would go to the Peace of Peace, but I don't know if he is really planning. I don't want to abducted the car's car!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small car room!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me, "I have an air stuffed. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said: "Ã¤h, as please note?"</seg>
<seg id="113">Night I was in bed, I stared on the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what I was broken out?</seg>
<seg id="114">A game that fits in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got up such fear that I went out of bed, to the ten-points to the door, and my sleep-door has completed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art, which he bought by me, is now in his classroom. he is now teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as hosts. it has changed my view-angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood when strands were sold, actually friends, who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People go to my air stuffed, it was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air frosted with.</seg>
<seg id="123">We make a period of time, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm working on unemployed, almost pleite, my fellow people, and the rent will be increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think Creativity can make it possible to transform fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new co-mates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I watched with me. our apartment will stay at a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">"" "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded as "Air matratory and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast "[AIRBed and Breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were able to sleep in the wood floors for 20 dollar.</seg>
<seg id="131">It was great, and we also found it.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure to make our cheese ham-ham-linollah completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We went touring with them by all the city. when we met our last guest and the door fell into the castle, stared Brian and me.</seg>
<seg id="134">We had just discovered that we find new friends and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former fellow resident, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">"" "we wanted to find out if one might make a business concept." ""</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented ourselves to investors: "we would like to create a website to organize the people public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the species, whose doors takes you over.</seg>
<seg id="139">Via the Internet, they can invite foreign people to participate in them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would be ignited.</seg>
<seg id="142">Indeed it was not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still very close at Trost, to invest in a business, the stranger allowed to sleep in the apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because of the children learnt to know that stranger is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, that you can find on the things that you can well. we could desiged.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we had learned that design has much more than just look and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned about how to designate objects, but now we wanted to create by the immense wealth, between people who never had never met earlier.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design so something like?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create design trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a cost sample, whom we trust trust.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force from you on your position.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumb high, when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to inform you your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocking mobile phone on your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent touch of panic has now felt -- -- is exactly what hosts, if it open the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only one that is more personal than your mobile phone, your home is home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can't read your SMS, you can see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel that unlocked up a stranger to the hands of a stranger to the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most importantly the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So most of the guests, when they wounds.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only from this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who has now actually Al Gores mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce on Twitter that he adds to the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of trust we want. I want to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a small detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your dog will only be presented once again with his name; if he tells, how he comes, how his dog or his children are hot?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine that you would have 150 Beurns, who say, "He really can really read very well-locked cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would have to give your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-done feedback system strengthens confidence in this.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people, negative impairments.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait to wait until both hosts as well as guest performances, before we introduced them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week, we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study. we investigated how probably it is that people trust in each other, depending on how they are similar to age and dormitory.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people at most, which are most unusual.</seg>
<seg id="179">Ever more differences are found, the less trust we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social life of bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">The exciting will be exciting when one adds the reputation of one person -- in our case by berries.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three Beursions, nothing changes to nothing.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep root preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we drove that confidence is dependent on how much man is in price.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">For example, if you're looking too little, for example, "Hi!," you get no answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">How to tell us much, as for example, "I have problems with my mother, -- -- will not be accepted by request.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of offences, e.g. "Tolle art works in your apartment! I make my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design, create these degrees to offline?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text area, to recommend the correct quantity text. we also give tips to which topics should be writing a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the proper design can help to overcome our privilege to overcome them.</seg>
<seg id="194">To what we were not counting, the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay out this incident.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people are entitled to our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredible much luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a demand, which had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there is also times, if not everything is smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who devastated Partys celebrated and devastated people.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than those calls. it does already I think when I think.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment which you hear in the voice of the callers, and is always our biggest motivation to improve us further.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, of the 123 million overnights, only a small fraction is only a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">The confidence is right in each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">If confidence works, can be wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts drove him into the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He also ended blood for the needed operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect home for travelers who tend to marginate activities on heart attacks.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are genuine protected gel that save a life even if they don't know yet.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car in the hospital when you die, and wait for a bypass tube.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel it, bring the books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can leave even longer, without the extra charge is calculated without any extra charge.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, doesn't work every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But this relationships among the pure monetary policy are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term, I asked me:</seg>
<seg id="225">How fits the thought of part with monetary policy?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's a economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it is now just a "rental industry" and it is not necessary to do it.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trading, the human relations.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a portion of itself, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you're travelling today, the Fast food is to compare it. it is efficient and reliably, but it is not authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would, however, if traveling a rich buffet of local entries would be?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be in every place to visit one group there, a group there would be to be able to hold a group there and a pub in a pub that has never heard, of which one has never heard.</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you want to learn from a five star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would shape the apartments from the reason to be used for merit?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would look like this?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would be, if cities would have thought out of joint venture?</seg>
<seg id="238">I work on me, giving us society and relations, instead of loneliness and amortisation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking places, which belonged to the government.</seg>
<seg id="240">Now, the inhabitants were offered. students who were looking for a lead was:</seg>
<seg id="241">People were conveyed to humans, whose children were moved out. there were incubation programmes.</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the Share economy. over our platform alone will be 785 000 people in 191 countries, by a stranger or even hosts.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea doesn't seem to be crazy about how it was brought us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also previously mentioned before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites for us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just worked?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and Timing, we recommend that you can find the correct design with the components of the confidential design.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deeper progress.</seg>
<seg id="250">I found the astonishing,</seg>
<seg id="251">In fact, overwhelming, overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about any time, if a red play goes over me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know that design can't solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if we could help us, if it had this great influence, I ask me for what we can soon use design.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believers do? a Expertin?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppresses, a brain laundering?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply delay one delay at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I give you the debt to your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">Thus, the media people who look like to look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study showed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims were negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans thought that most would do not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably the people don't speak with their uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For everyone who have never learned a Muslims, it is great, you meet to meet them.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you, who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee of coffee -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am married,</seg>
<seg id="271">A MÃ¶chtegern-Fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I was a practicing, spiritual muscle in.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do with this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I met the decision to ousted me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslimin. I decided to bear the hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminists were decomposed: "Why do you decide yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The Lusitant was: at that time, there was a feminist independence of independence, which I felt as a 17-year-old felt a perfect and unachievable beauty.</seg>
<seg id="279">I haven't just received the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have done with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought out in question, turned into question, and he believed that.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow devotion, which together with any reading of the Korans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the Rhythmik takes me sometimes to wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I felt myself myself therein. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Had, you ever had the feeling that someone takes you, you understand, and does not love them?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then the terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember exactly what they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, at the end, looked at the screen and looked on the screen, and saw the word "Express message."</seg>
<seg id="293">Since, smoke, aircraft flew in buildings, men and buildings from the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was the?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">Technical error?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock absorbing fast in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something like?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the TV channel and heard: "the Muslim terrorist..."... [...] in the name of Islam..., "... jihad..."...</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my land, but in the Nu, the deeds of others came into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the United States to go into a new city and begin with the foundation.</seg>
<seg id="303">I recall that I am -- when we drove me -- deep it went into my seat in my seat, and I saw me the first time he was to be recognised as Muslimin.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved in this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, I saw, and read the warfare of national Islamic organizations that might know: "be waking," Seid autiously, "lead in good lit areas," "Versammmet you don't."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was last Friday in the week -- the day, participated in Muslims to Beten.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings: "does not go to this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked the extensive coverage of reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandingly, and I heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who were Muslims arrested in Free Free and struck them.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really Brandanette to Museen.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something was not really correct.</seg>
<seg id="314">The people who had attacked this land, attacked our land.</seg>
<seg id="315">I noticed the people of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also raged.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain how to explain himself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually say people, "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When we will do it? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to serve Muslims as well as Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like from a tumor in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: we are malignant or good?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor removed as a whole, and a good tumor keeps man only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are sinuseless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are Muslims like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventor and teachers, Ersthelfer and Olympioniken.</seg>
<seg id="330">Becomes the closure of Museen America?</seg>
<seg id="331">Maybe a few parking, but not the terror stop.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to consider people of more tolerant, and even greater civil staff.</seg>
<seg id="333">And how to me a head of the police in the Washington DC area, DC have recently told: people are actually not in Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They will be radiated in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">When the Radiating process has been revealed that it begins online. as a result, the person is believed to do so that the person believes that the terrorists can be the true Muslims, and everyone who say their behaviour and their ideology may have fallen by faith, or by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent Radiation, we must stop people to go to the Mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some of them are still claim that Islam was a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS its brood-brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslimin, as mother, as man, I think we need to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we will add ourselves in her suburbs, when one recognises them as a representative of 1.6 billion faithful.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology in their "Holy book" on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But if you have a look at it, they don't know what they do in her "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is its brood-quality, which they can read these things in the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An excellent Imam told me a remarkable history:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because she is a way to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him whether they have been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said that this problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy, with whom she had spoken, she brought her to the silence, saying that her anger was in the world, she would only bring in trouble for the iniquity in the world.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing, and something that had been given to her weut sense, she was a key goal for the instrumentalization of the extremists who responded to a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam sent the connection to God and the church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accuse them to accuse her Wut, he showed her design way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">So what they learned in the mosque, they made it to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight, like the Islamophobia me and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it works on normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it works on any other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day on our actions of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientist studies -- show: if we are afraid, happen at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept more an authorized government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that when people were forced, in which negative about Muslims reported in which they were more military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the rights of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at the mood against Muslims in the top of the river -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then last three times, but never happened in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the lead before the war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural response to the Moslem terror as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to support the foundation of an open society, which were reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We might see it perhaps the first, but the toxic air of fear.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective education, it is not only about to explain himself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was involved in the dental faculty, talented, much more...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he knew of the sweetest, more generous man who knew them.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him, and he found her life-run. she was amazing and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is from my breeze, such a young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razor who was in the afternoon, as during one execution after he had directed against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight time on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatismus may not only be immoral, but also mortally.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we walked to the Mosque or so we stayed at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We did not praying it and for us, it was not a slight decision, because we went to our children, saying that we had to control ourselves by fear, or one that we can do our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to meet us for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat, we went up with high-pressure to the Mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and my shoes went out, went into prayer, and what I saw me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restarted.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam sent a announcement, thanked our guests, because half of the meetings were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Atheists, believers and non-believers who were come to attack, but to us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment, I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they were courage, and compassion and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What do you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose the moment of fear and fanatics?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go to number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or you will be connected to which my: we are better than those who are.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you have to hit a Nerv.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I ask me, what you ask me, perhaps you say that you're looking for a TEDTalk, a memoryurt with deep-course, i.e. an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't know it. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">No exception. I have no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am so usually, as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If one can look around the Muslims on the whole world, and I did it with the largest ever conducted study on the Muslims in the world, people want to know people.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want to live prosperity for the family, they want to live and live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So, I have no exception in any regard.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people are usually appear, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thanks. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What started as a platform for Bastler, it stands shortly before, to be a herring business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drug drones. possible, the research institutions are possible worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before the air package deal in our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of flight machines in the Frac Centre in France has built up a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago she began to fly with bars.</seg>
<seg id="410">By comparison, flight machines achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build a self-resistant structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">You have learned, loads of loads, go with turmoil and react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possibility in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to make a system autonomous, it must know it collectively know where the mobile objects are in space.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our lab at the ETH Zurich we use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic ttasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">We use a new localizations of Verity Studios, an extradition of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available on top ebe. e. g. "start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight unit, which tries to beat two Flies with a folding flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starmalglers it is efficiently efficiently efficiently, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Contrary to most of the starter, it can be Swedish, so it has great benefits from start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a bowling page.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-rigid is that they react sensitively to turmoil like windbÃ¶en.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight machine doesn't reach the optimal position in which the performance can be improved and improved performance by exercise.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves a lot of abstract questions that permeate to the core of the thing.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the small number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to answer the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known about as machines with a thousand-movable parts that refer to injury.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades prior to decades, trained pilot-controlled flight machines were flying, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a rear engine.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently, we discovered that Flies with just one work.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner Â®, the mechanically simplunged flight device. it was invented by short.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No folding, Scharniere and Querruder, no other pitch or counter surfaces, only a propeller of propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, it happens in the inside life very much, so it can move stable, and move in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it doesn't have to bring out the rear algorithm used by the rear. to get there, I must find it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The chance to look at exactly right if I would like to look at it, so I show you a video showing the last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monospan information is a exercise in gene flow, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight Propellers, a exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What do I do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">You'll see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">This is why he is a ambience in his orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the most successful capability,</seg>
<seg id="447">In room to move in all directions, no matter what it is filmed or even like it.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight Propeller.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is possible in models, the rest is directly connected when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">See us we see at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="451">If airplanes should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliably.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns into clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise sense.</seg>
<seg id="455">If one builds up together, they are like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something wrong is wrong -- a motor or propeller falls, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, if also limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that, we will demonstrate half a flight.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="459">The greatest number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took the normal micro-quadcopter -- any individual weighs less than a disc bread -- and outfit them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit is white, where in the room it is controlled and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you're doing this demonstrations, to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine da glands want to be a faint Lampenumbrella on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For the types as of us is the salary of the development and the Schaffensity.</seg>
<seg id="466">It is as a memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that there is creative, wise ways, they allow them to form a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has been such a massive and economic potential, is the TÃ¼zen on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">A very far distant galaxy below 1.3 billion years ago in a very far distant galaxy, two black holes are still quicker, they made a mass of three probe in a ten telecerkunde in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment, it lit brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the whole universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very large Knall.</seg>
<seg id="472">They did their energy, but not in the form of light free --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black LÃ¶ger.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time feelings and the universe exploded in gravitation.</seg>
<seg id="475">We would like to bring the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">Approximately 1.3 billion years ago, it was just more recent life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has been a lot: coral, fish, plants, Saurier, people, and -- God arise with -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">Some 25 years ago, Rai Weiss decided to build a group of particularly brave -- Rai Weiss from MIT, kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of the Caltech -- a huge laser detector in order to search for free with collizing black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them held them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people called them as crazy genius, so the U.S. National Science Foundation has financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely much hard work they built the Detector LIGO: the Laser Interferometrics Gravitation-Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO could significantly increase the performance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="483">So, it's called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 LIGO started to clarify some smaller, hard-looking problems to clarify problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the Detector, the gravitation-shafts of both collious black holes caused by the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the Detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the say goodbye to my toise's father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, the fruits of my life plant.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, for what I had worked, is not longer science fiction! AA: that's my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been researched with Observatories as well as LIGO measurable signals.</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitation wave is a crowning in the feelings of room and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When taking the shaft of the shaft, the room and its entire contents will be moved into one direction, and into the other stripes.</seg>
<seg id="495">To implement Does in courses for recharging theory often have an right albered dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"deable and dust, deable and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitation shafts extremely weak, even ridiculous, are ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, everyone was deposed by us at the waves of the waves and gesture. the expansion of an average person was 10 high-21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means that 20 zeroes after the Comma followed by one 1, the LIGO employees explained the LIGO employees.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser Detector, and that's already absurd, this length should be measured at less than a thousandths of a radius of an atomic s exactly. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of its classical text via gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described kip Thorne, co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves in this way: "the technical difficulties of the construction such a detectors are razed.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicist are finalist and with the support of the public, iss to overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims that LIGO should be more ear than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around: facial features, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">That is quite practical. for so, you can use a picture or a card of things that you want to get around the light of several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">It is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That's why it is very hard to manufacture a picture of things that do you mean especially:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we went according to certain features such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close to the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now speaks in Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob" breaks her. "</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "the number Bob." "" "</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitation shafts.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can do not produce an easy images of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by looking at changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to us their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least there are the measured frequencies for LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert the shaft pattern in Schall, we can hear the All literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation of laught, can us roughly much about the collision of two black holes when my colleague Scott have already been very busy.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, zircons are simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two body very quickly, you can find the same zircons with an additional sound changes. this sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu:</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of motion modes, shaped like the wave form.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date which, at least I never forget to hear this as a device by -- SH:... two black lugs with 30-time solar mass, that's about as fast as the bars of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: we are superior to us what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes that are the most densely body in all, one with a mass of 29 sonnen, the other with a mass of 36 sonnen, among whom one hundred times a second, before they're collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine the forces before.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein are the constant importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO ebnet has a completely new way to explore the Alls, as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can hear the All laugh and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all, we can see -- practically or basically -- not to see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A Supernova, for example. I would like to know why the entrances stars in Supernovae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we have learned a lot about all of them.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen at the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon, and silicon hides.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, since this opak are never seen.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitation waves are penetrating iron, when it would be transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minute of the Alls, but we will never see, since the prickall can cover his own reflashes.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitation waves it should be possible to look back until the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that we have never seen that we have never seen that we will never see, and of which we have not have a show. things we only discover that we will not discover.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO found equal to the first time of things that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars, the black holes, as LIGO they observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes were to say to the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO enables us to make a completely new look at the events in All, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of that chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be so brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">We know, thanks to LIGO, we know how to build a great detectors and circus of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatories - a whole new generation of Observatories on Earth and All.</seg>
<seg id="550">What could be more beautiful than the prickall himself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time is great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams come with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I had a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">A year I would expect to all "Yes!" before I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="556">Anyway, whether it made me nervous, me in unpleasant situations, I wanted to say "Yes" to say.</seg>
<seg id="557">Wanted to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">Yes, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Wanted to live live on television?</seg>
<seg id="560">Yes, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted me to play with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">Yes, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, wovor I feared me, eliminating my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, speeches, my social fear -- Puff, weg.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "my life has changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a particular Yes that could change my life in a unexpectedly manner. it started with a question of my mini.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the small, calls for unexplained reasons, "</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a cellar in the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"Evaluator, I needed milk for my Schnabeltasse."</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me to play me whether I was with you, when I was just on the jump, and I said, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life's setting in my family. from there I am going to play with them, as soon as you do with it. no matter what I do, or when I am, I say, I say Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am relessly me very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: just before short, I was actually complete that the "Yes" Sagen for playing with my children my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a true dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I'm author. I think myself things out of, try out to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I have creative television. I produced television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I am television, in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season I am responsible for a 70-hour program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV-programs, 70 hours TV. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every shipment provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for a episode of a TV channel can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Say we are five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days spent four shows, four TV channels, 70 hours of TV, three programmes, which simultaneously hold in production, are four times a week: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes of Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours Television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series will run on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">Throughout the world, my series is in 256 regions for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is globally, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are prepared, which I have created it, and not only produced, so I'll find time to talk about my fans, to gather my fans and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, warehouses, which are burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know that?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to print you in mind.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "Author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I say it to you, if you are interested, if you say a company, a country or a classroom, I don't understand that I am not only about computer and imaginable, and it's true if I say, I understand that there is not a dream job in a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, everything work, everything reality, all blood, all silence -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm engaged in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work is always a country from the Nichts.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, when I troops on, when I painted a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So, one has a very high tone, but this is a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">It feels like BeyoncÃ©.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love it.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, arduous and infusion, funny and undisturbed, clinically and maternal, cruel and more reasonable, and the best of them is the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums begins in my head, and it grows and growing, and the sums of the sums are like a busy road, I might go for ever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume, when I inherit the Summen that I am writing, that the writing is preparing to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me, this does her.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the Summen -- when I began working with the television production when I began working and work to work, create and work, discovered this thing about this sums, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The Summen is more than the writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The Summen is action and activity. Summen is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums of music is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums of God is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have so a swmen, then you cannot wait differently than the size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not otherwise, as after size, no matter what the price.</seg>
<seg id="624">The name is the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps this is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it's Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know it.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know that I did not have the failure of the failure, and I know that I love the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="631">I want to say you, I am a titanium, and I know that I will not plan to question.</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to make one clear: the successful I will find out more on the more episodes, the more overcome, the more space, the more things, the more things, the more you see me, the more write me, the more than I find history, the more expectations are.</seg>
<seg id="633">Ever more I work to be successful, the more must work with me.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what I said about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">Do I love work?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country, which I weapon, the Marathon, the Marathon, the army, the screen, the high sound, the sums, the sums of the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="639">I only have this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then stops the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="641">Excessive, excessive strain, burned down.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums of the sums.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters to the truth are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single work institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum is not there, but you can write my nephew."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson said, "Evaluator, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It are the children of a Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-titles.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the Summen heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine are hidden.</seg>
<seg id="650">I love my work no longer. the engine was out of.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums came not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same title of Titanen's work, 15 hours days, carried out weekends, no Reuben, nothing delighter, a titanium, don't exist, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever the same.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no Summen.</seg>
<seg id="655">Silent.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV-programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV-programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showpiece of titanium,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I had no fun more.</seg>
<seg id="661">And this was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the Summen and the Summen I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what makes you doing, if that is doing, the work that you love, suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know how many do you think: "Heulieve out of, blue of the author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know what to do you know, one teacher, one artist, Bill Gates, is just one another, and that is one of the sums, and know how to know the sums it, and know how to know the Summen knew that the sums of the swans, who is it?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What I'm?</seg>
<seg id="669">I still have a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart hears, I can survive in the silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then, my "South states" waiters will be a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">I'm sitting on the way to outside, late and they say, "mum, magic you play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say, I will say to me two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I need to say Yes, and secondly, they called me "Evaluator."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "" "" "" "" "" "". "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="676">When is the happens?</seg>
<seg id="677">I let it, if I am standing and my sums up, and here changes everything before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says: "mum, magic you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">I say, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and play with sisters, we got them much, and I started most dramatic from the book "Everybody Poops".</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is excellent because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and in the mouth of the Sumatra, I can do nothing to fit except.</seg>
<seg id="684">I'm focussed on.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country, which I weapon, the Marathon, the Marathon, the army, the country, the high sound - they exist no longer.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists, sticky finger and mocks, zew voices, juniors and the song, in which it's going to leave, or whatever the girl in "Die Frozen Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere, peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so just that I am hardly breathe hale.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I am atme.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I'm happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something I dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">An mental door goes onto and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">Feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The Summen comes slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is since.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel me, I would know a magic mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay in the case.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no mystery. not love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the work men, the Titanensum, that is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If you query, if I tell you, if I am to tell you, if I am pressed out using broadcasts and TV-hours and how working my brain is, I don't forget what the real sum is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no strength and it is not work specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The true sums is dependent on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the electricity, who comes from the life of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums it is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums are ignored the pressure of the history, which leads to do digest tasks, anticipation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The true sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The true sums of God is God's voice in my ear, but maybe even led me God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I am doing so, so I can liberate me as a workaholic of any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I don't have any other choice. I don't have any other choice if I want to hear the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="720">Wish I wish it might be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Games do not play ansatly as well.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does God,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I work always, for I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work in the workplace as a home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This uniqueness is painful, because what a man works better than a house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly honest, I nenne myself myself "Titan," --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am what I am too, is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rasen in the garden, before and back, and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play Ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crushed Seifenbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">In this way, I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always get to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">There is O.K.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how man lives, and the sums of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask me, Why do we have ever heard with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also tell it! let's always tell you if your child would like to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep me for naiv, for a day of day.</seg>
<seg id="742">Have you probably quite, but you can do it!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet-show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting, than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes with me until they were able to make something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, you will replace a Marienkie or Keks.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speaks my teenie daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more demand it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring 15 minutes on the piece, even at a bad-attitude!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes per piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no abrasion.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is shortly: dinner, the children will be ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are not possible!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my charities, my world. do not need to be the children. it is true, the sums up to place a place for the soul of peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not going to play with his own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">You can enjoy 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I try and I will make victories. friends meet, books, read the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"if you're playing?" is a short, I got up, when I got my first TV show when I was playing a titanium in training when I wanted to thank myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes at the piece, why not you want to go full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my leisure time. the sums it seems, when I wasn't working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work not without playing games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It's time, but after a few months, a door opens up in my office. I listen to a well-known melody for me and my soul. she has led me to new ideas. I get back his way back. I feel it in full breasts and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums of the sums it is not... more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap blings and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The Summen of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's me by myself, that I am a titanium, and I never seen a titanium, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes, too less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And nevertheless I have everything in the handle. my brain is still working yet. my disbonfires still burn.</seg>
<seg id="781">Ever more I play, the happy are I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">Ever more I play, the more feel I feel as good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clear is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">Ever more I'm playing, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more you hear the Summen. the country, the Marathon, the Marathon, the Marathon, the gates, the gates, the buds, the Summen, the Summen, the right, the right Summen: the Summen of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">Ever more I feel this sums, the more makes this unusual, stable, bare and new life-feeling in me wide. less Titan - more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">Ever more I feel exactly this mares, the more knows I, who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I'm author. I think myself out of myself, I teach you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this jobs,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be too bad.</seg>
<seg id="792">I told "Yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen is no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"" "you play?" ""</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgin.</seg>
<seg id="797">How most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human wings.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a severe stroke or after an auto case.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us of Neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain has, in contrast to other body organic, a very low capacity to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a constant, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional Neurosurgin.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They are sure to have one of the most well-known, the "Tiefenhirnity." there is an electrode deep in the brain to affect the circuits of the neurons so that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, who suffered severe tremor and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean Neuro-cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional Neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">I'm looking forward to this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to around.</seg>
<seg id="810">With a little help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story started 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time, I was leading the physician and working day and night in the notation.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often, I supplied patients with skull-Hirn-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to introduce that at skull-Hirn-gmata, the brain anschwillful and the skull-incting press has been said.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save the life, you have to reduce the cranial pressure level.</seg>
<seg id="816">Instead you must remove a part of swollen brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead, instead of the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse with Jean FranÃ§ois Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What my I do so?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from a tissue piece, it is comparable to very small children who are out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the correct diet, temperature, humidity and environments to be blossom.</seg>
<seg id="823">Just that we had to make these cells with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-FranÃ§ois Hollande.</seg>
<seg id="825">He looked at the scope of his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like such a stem cell culture. with great green cells, surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you don't know from the biologieBooks that stem cells are unaffected cells that can turn into each cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation of observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells stopped differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slow down slowly and after a few weeks she died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, however, was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand how they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are hot doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You can make 4% of our wholesale rind cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they ensure the brain the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why they will receive us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain, because we find it in higher concentrations near brain abuses.</seg>
<seg id="847">This is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear - of these cells, we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are in front of a potential cell source, the brain is possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass out of the pre-speaking area and then the cells were exactly as cultured as it was Jean-FranÃ§ois,</seg>
<seg id="853">And they would like to mark the color in order to pursue them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step reimplanted it was in the same level as the same name.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- autographs transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we pass these cells into normal brain tissue, which will happen when we pass the same cells into sintered brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we observed the cells into a healthy brain and we observed, that they were taken from a few weeks when they were taken back, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they will not be used there, so disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we had a violation of injury and reimplanted the same cells, and now, the cells were given to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could see under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">Proof of evidence showing these small points are these small points. these are the cells that we solved in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not hear the course of course.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help this cells to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">Thus, we received monkeys with a manual point task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">As they achieved a stable policy level, the last we had the motoring Cortex in the motoring Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">The monkeys were the monkey, they couldn't move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen at people, they recovering up to a certain degree, exactly as according to a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are yellow and then try to recover them with the help of plastificated mechanisms. they can recover from a certain degree, just as with the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we are sure that the Afts had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we had reached its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left-hand side you see the monkeys, which arise spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can be about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now you see when we reimplanted the cells: the same axis, two months after the maturity.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you, that were very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still going to be implanted with humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I hope that I can soon show you soon as the human brain is going to heal themselves.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I am sure now, several dozens of people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know anyone who need it need."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely have any case.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question of what are the biggest obstacles, before you can start clinical studies on the people.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the largest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results you need to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: it is understandable that the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and a professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG said: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried the permission to take the start of clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years takes you to hospital, and will be available to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will allow us to allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then one must perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It's already a long time to select treatment and evaluate the treatment and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Afterwards one must use the multi-center study on a multicentre study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must really make sure that it can be useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG said: and that it is sure, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for your visit to TED and that you have told us.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG said: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a great mistake they consider as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see the democracy not as the fragile plant, which is in reality, but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as unaltered gevity.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee KuiYew from Singapore and his great aftermath in Beijing has proved that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth while the policy is fully overthrew.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy will be home to us in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the new Greek government -- the new Minister for Finance in the Eurogroup -- the democratic process of our country -- our election -- not allowed to influence the austerity programs, which have been realised in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there might be no better legal for Lee KuiYew, or the Communist Party, or some of my concestically friends, which would be repeated, that democracy would be abolished, if they would like to change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to introduce a economic model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">Please, together with me, to believe that Lee KuiYew, the Communist Party of China and even the eurogroup of a mistake, we could save us the democracy, but that we require a truth and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies have been carried out our societies, our future, and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of the subject, I would like to point out an interesting form, which currently is threatened to be threatened with interest.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "the twin summit-paradox." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A peak is well known. you know and recognize it as the debt of the debt, which makes his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt of the debt.</seg>
<seg id="918">But just a few recognizing its plilling.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of wasted cash that is, however, is to invest in it, where there could be productive and income, with which one could produce the debt of the debt of the debt, and all those things are needed to avoid mankind, for example, "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I have two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the USA, in England and in the Eurozone, 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars have been invested in all the prosperity of wealth, such as industrial facilities, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, gain, equipment and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion U.S. dollars has a lot of money, until it compares that there were $1 trillion dollars, compared to the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock markets and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">So, debts and lack of capital, the twin summit, which are not covered by the common market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages that would not invest more than a quarter of the 25-54 year old in the United States, Japan and Europe, which will not invest exactly. just like Ãdipus Father, who might be afraid of fear that prophecy would kill him, if he will kill him,</seg>
<seg id="925">Uncertain the circumstances leads to the circumstances that hatches him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely popular capital should be used to improve our lives, to improve human resources, and particularly all the technologies to finance, "green" technologies that are crucial for the rescue of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is for democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think. but before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the corporate form, to control the Free and the poor as a majority the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athic democracy joined of course in a lot of --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake, the job value of the athic democracy because of these joints.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision of the athic democracy was and said that they were not only sending the right to free opinion, but rather more important and a crucial role, that they gave them the right to policy-determination with equal vocal weighting into questions of the statutes.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athic democracy could not be held long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which is very bright, it is burned down rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present-liberal democracies have not their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athic democracy focused on the free citizens and the working arms, our liberal democracy were focused on the values of Magna Carta, who ultimately became a statute for prevailing.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy occurred only when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process on the policy was made, while the economy -- the world of companies -- a democratic zone has been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our current democratic party, since the time, in which the separation of politics and economy began, an adverse struggle between the two, increasing the politics and confered them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering, why the politicians did not want any more like earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not an degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is true that there are nowadays in the government, but not in power because the power of politics into the economy is washed and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is in about such a flock of smoking, the most sustainable animals, of which they are nourished, that they will be hungry by the end of the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy by making the politics itself. the power of the concert is growing, political goods increases, the overall economic demand, and the managing director of the corporations are shattered to invest the cash of their company.</seg>
<seg id="948">According to capitalism "Demos" [the people] of the democracy markets, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and the welfare of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If it is true, it is obvious that we must bring the policy and the economy again, and it would be better if the "Demos" will hold your control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the absence of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left that idea had already been 100 years ago and it wasn't really good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson of the Debakel of the Soviet Union should be, that the working arms was only caused by a miracle, as in the ancient Athens order, without new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it, replacing Niedriglohns by automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that, as long as long and politics separate areas, automation of the twin summit will be higher, the waste of torture and social conflicts deeper, such as I think -- will happen in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we must make the economy and the areas of economy and politics again, and that we pay attention that we want to re-use the re-agreed area, otherwise we are able to appear in a non-term hyperautocrative, which means the film "Matrix" as a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">Thus, the question is not whether the capitalism became the technical achievements that he has produced, survival -</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is to be replaced by a dystroscopy, similar to the people who serve the society in "Star Trek" in which the universe was in charge of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long discussions with the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we are optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would like to look like it might look like this "Star Trek" like utopia instead of the "matrix "-like Dystroscopy?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you a few examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: imagine an capital market, in which you earned money, while you are working and in your capital, you will be able to work from a company to the next, and the company -- regardless of which one has just been -- is the property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then, all income from capital, and redeem, and the concept of wage work is completely overtaken.</seg>
<seg id="964">There are no distinction between those among whom the company does not work there, and employees who work there, but the company does not include. no exchange rate between investment and work, no large Laps between investment and savings, and finally not a temporary twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies would have a free float exchange rate in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging markets] will be issued in the interest of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that all the world trade will be traded in this currency, we call it "The Kosmos," in units of "Kosmos" '-- and every government pays off the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trading of the country, into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, particularly in parts of the world, in which investment means are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically the fact that John Maynard Keynes had proposed to the Bretton Woods conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that one had not implement the technical funds at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have, especially in front of the background of a reunited politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world, which I mean you, is the same time liberties in which it is privileged persons, and marxed because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the history of history, and keynesiosis, global keynesial.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all other it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will waking up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or we will drop in a "matrix" - similar diystroscopy?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You wish to find yourself in your biography itself as the liberties Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's Analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any what I have just said to be relevant, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of Politics and Economy is... Tun we don't think the technological development will generate a massive fall in the overall economic demand that Larry Summers are called "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis in a part of the Earth, as we know it, it will not only be our democrat destabilize, but also the countries whose interest is low for democracy.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant, Marx is very relevant.</seg>
<seg id="986">As well as Hayek, that's why I have a liberatous Marxist and like Keynes, and therefore I am quite wirl.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG said: indeed, and now we are probably also well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't do so, consider not enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG said: this is a very Greek, a kind philosophical statement -- YV: in your talk about Singapore and China, and yesterday at the dinner of the Redner did you very clear what you keep from the point of view to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a big measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have a democracy of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my speech, we have limited democracy to the politics, while the area where most of it plays, -- the area of the economy - is a totally democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In certain ways, if I can say the so provoking saying, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- -- don't remember -- we tend to connect to liberalism with democracy -- that is an error, historically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberale, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical, which concerns the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can watch in China in China, resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now permits to do what the West in the 19th century itself has done, has raping down to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG said: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I noticed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG said: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How to look back six months later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, personal view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the euro zone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely from the self-fake to adopt, and the digestible, that a massive shift-line by the euro zone, and continues to continue massively at the development of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity to be on the basis of Greek divorce - by the way, the first suggestion was revealed to divestment.</seg>
<seg id="1008">It was correct to make it right. unfortunately, the moon within the euro zone, in the group, continues to continue.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you tried to get a economic system that is not viable, by policy will and performance guitar, you may have a while in a while, however, if the change happens, it happens to abruptible and destroyable.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what do you advance?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future, if we do not change their structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG said: have you made any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG said: for example? YV: everyone, who look back -- Ernsthal...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If it has a Minister for Finance, or any minister, who, after 6 months in the office, especially in such an established situation, claims that he didn't make a mistake, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made error.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest error was to sign an application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was a honest interest on pages of the money, a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that gave it not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to bring to our government, only because they would not have to deal with the evaluation of the euro zone, who had to run the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They don't want to stand out that it has been a catastrophic program for 5 years in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the Troika of the money that has imposed this policy was imposed this policy: "that was a colossaler error."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: in spite of all the aggressive Tons of the talks, seem to be quite right per-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the euro zone versus, from somebody, the Europe lives and loves.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the euro zone did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they did not survive, the Fliehof forces are demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This is not alone consequences for Europe catastrophic consequences, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the most powerful economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we are happy to enter the way of a postmodern 1930, which it appears me, it will also be dreaming for the future of Europeans like the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope very pleased that you go wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, many thanks, that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Most of Roy Price have never heard, although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision to hit the Roy had three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a Igeldaur and describes himself on Twitter as "films, TV, technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for this, shows the shows and the content you will produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought sector.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy can not have any select.</seg>
<seg id="1047">It must find shows the very well, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows the right on this curve on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation is shown from 1 to 10 and the height as many shows this review will receive.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Your show with nine and higher is rated, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">That are shows how "breaking bath," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where one has left one season, your brain asks: "where are there are more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This type of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, here on this end, shows how "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should be enough to say that at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not decide to get on the left side of the curve, because I don't need special intelligence, to undergo "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts on the average output, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor poorly bad, they don't miss it.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course, it is the first time that Amazon should make something like something, so that Roy will not plan anything else.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes lots of ideas for TV shows and chooses an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of this shows and represents them online where they can look for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if you're out for free things, you are going to get right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at this episoden.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that it will be observed during the day of this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team, which will take part.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You may capture when you start the show, when one sees it, which parts will be overthrown or again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You will earn millions of data to decide with these dates, what do they produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process these and resulting from the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a sitCom via four republican US Senate."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Someone who knows the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that do not remember that show, because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.4, and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- therefore something about the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team had worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At the same time, another manager has given a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the Manager for Programming of Netflix. just as Roy is always in search to find this one Super show, and he is also using data, but it does somewhat different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of a competition, he and his team have met the existing data on the Netflix audience, i.e. the evaluations which they give the shows, the course, which shows them like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then, they use these data to find this small details about the audience: what shows they like that producer, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had developed all the parts, they went a car, and decided not to make a seat at a seat of four channels, but a drama series on a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix has a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"House of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this corner. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course this question is what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">Two very kompetitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">It connect this many data and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is the?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic is somehow states that the fact should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collects millions of data, for a decision to meet you, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as Back-Up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The minous, what you can expect, is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is a bit scary, because we live in a period, in which we live and more to statistics, to meet serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Anyone who knows here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in this room ever in touch with this software. come in touch with contact, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in the USA in prison, and is asking this, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide if a show is good or bad, it is decided to whether a person is good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Medium-sized television, 22 minutes, which can be bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results. this is not aware that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to get data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data sealed companies are very wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes sometimes error.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it is due to data analysis of flu outbreaks of flu, limiting species, predictions -- by data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It was functional and was a great news release. the success culminated in an publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It works fine, year around year, until there is no longer functional,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It was quite simple, this was once again a sensation, including the release of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google will sometimes be misunderstanding.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these mistakes the data and decisions made in decisions of life a -- at the workplace, at the law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many trouble with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very strong people are unusually using many data to meet serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I have detected some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and non-successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you do mostly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">The first place to analyse this problem into its single parts, so you can analyse the individual parts. as a second, you set the single parts back to create a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you must do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to cut a problem, and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to take part in the parts and come to a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For this there is another tool and we have all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that the brain is good, it is pieces of pieces and pieces again, even if the information is uncomplete, if the information is uncomplete, to touch a good resolution -- especially if the brain is one of the experts.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and understanding, where they also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to understand their audience better, for which they don't have been capable of yet. but the decision, how to put all these parts, and resulting from a show like "House of Cards" which stood not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision to show what they meant a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">By contrast, this was based on the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They use users to control all their decisions, first as they voted on TV ideas, then as they voted "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision to say, because they say, "tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It was not the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things can go wrong, if data will begin to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how power are full, data are only a tool to forget about this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you are...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "magic 8 Ball" as it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No question, you have to get only the ball into order to get a reply. "highly likely, -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will see it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have so far hit some decisions in my life, where I would have to listen to the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace these, through a bit of expression, like data analysis, to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this changes not the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball matrix and sophisticated and sophisticated. finally, it is possible to meet decisions, if we want to reach something exceptional at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I'm very encouraging news that despite the great amount of data, there is still a number of data to meet decisions, an expert in which you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end, it is not the data but the risks involved with which you arrived at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you.</seg>
