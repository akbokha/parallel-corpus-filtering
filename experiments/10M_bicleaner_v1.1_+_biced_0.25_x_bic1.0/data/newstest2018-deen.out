Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps to change your view to the city
an Irish @-@ institution old , where youth were supposed to meet today .
a Pentec@@ ost@@ at , where is excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small g@@ är@@ tner proved the unanim@@ ous reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Mün@@ chener promotes exciting stories to days .
it is nervous , if maps is not currently known .
the knows everyone who had already had to be exciting , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i instead of a revers@@ al road showed a green me@@ adow .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ l@@ ases , a wide range of Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ eur as Bavaria , state government , are all other than currently - but just that is very busy .
especially if they compar@@ es with current online cards .
then the towns and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Münchner Merk@@ ur has changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ est@@ ry , which is not recogn@@ ises as such as such .
in the great map ticket , for cities and communities of more detailed cards , so @-@ called Ur@@ fes@@ tivities .
these were created according to the Bay@@ erische surve@@ ying administration between 1810 and 1864 and the first surve@@ ying of Bay@@ erns .
client : Napoleon .
the French Army occupied Germany since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wish to make an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bay@@ erns in order - of course a military purposes .
even if the French troops moved with the Peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 1801 : the present neighbours , that the idea of a region covers Bavaria map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV. asser@@ ted the project in particular , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus the Bay@@ erische publisher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pri@@ esth@@ ood for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 , and is like all other on the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison morning / today is on the example of the state capital at the most impressive .
the city has extended into all directions and has grown to it .
one example is sub@@ s@@ end@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated from the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was 21 years after creating the map , i.e. 1877 , as the Munich district .
today , Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling is located right in the middle of the city .
the houses are located in 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named by Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers in Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can &apos;t see nothing as a field - in the first sight : when the sign @-@ out map with d@@ utz@@ ing lines and numbers : handwritten notes from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ gent , &quot; which was derived from the base tax .
small par@@ c@@ els is under@@ lined there today no farmers more - but small g@@ är@@ tner of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green surface is located north of Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling .
the Theresi@@ enstadt , since 1810 was the site of the October of the October , was actually a me@@ adow by a me@@ adow and a concrete desert .
on the other hand of the Is@@ ar there is an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only reads the street names &quot; at the host &quot; or from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the Lü@@ ding@@ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also in great letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Lü@@ beck &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße left a man with W@@ ahn@@ ks in the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße .
there was in 1858 / 59 the Munich circle Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt für Au@@ er Lü@@ beck . &quot;
from the 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden , led the establishment of the psychiat@@ rist , that was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time , and ended , for example , the anchor in the so @-@ called ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he says the staff , violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the Anst@@ amm show .
first place for 280 patients was first place , later was extended to 500 seats .
sometime , this capacity was not enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ ren@@ anstalt in hair 1905 .
there has been the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of the largest psychiat@@ rist of Germany since 2006 .
on the grounds of the former Au@@ er institutions , youth meet in Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the order was acquired in the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with a training centre .
west is the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich Ost , east dormit@@ ories from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co , &quot; built in an architectural approach to the establishment of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , who had been destroyed during the Second World War .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 18@@ 56 , as &quot; main square , &quot; the name of the name was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
a decisive change in the Second World War also brought the hearts of the Second World War .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies , in December 1944 , many holes in the city centre .
a big stayed until today - am Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a greeting card in the Middle Ages were once scheduled to work on Mari@@ enhof , where this days will work together and will take place on 5 April 2017 in the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn @-@ Bahn .
the old Munich @-@ map series can compare the old Munich @-@ map with the air picture of today - and the hole at Mari@@ enhof was fill up .
civil rights Group published travel for Mis@@ souri
the National Association for the promotion of Far@@ ming has issued a warning for the colored politics and racial attacks of the state to Mis@@ souri .
the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Committee shall come into force by August 28 , 2017 in force , because a number of frag@@ mented by state of particular attention and external particular caution is to be able to happen , because a number of frag@@ mented , deteri@@ oration @-@ based events throughout the state of the state , and here will be noted , &quot; it is said in the opinion of the Group .
a recent law by Mis@@ souri , which makes people he@@ avier with discrimination , as well as the criminal authorities in the state of State , the disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ on minorities are aiming to boost your destinations , the NA@@ AC@@ P said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
you have the violations of the civil rights to happen people .
they are put together because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .
&quot; we listen to complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning that has issued the organization for a state in the United States .
the group raised inci@@ dents as racial se@@ eded against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
His differently , however , under frag@@ mented circumstances in the beginning of the year , after , during the journey through the state no petrol had been taken into custody and by the police of Mis@@ souri , without a crime .
the Council also shows a recent report by the Office of the General At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ General of Mis@@ souri , in which black drivers can be more common in the state of 75 percent more frequently .
&quot; the recommendation is that humans are conscious and their families , friends and employees , what could happen in Mis@@ souri could happen , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; the people must be ready to bring whether it bring into account or the relatives , that they may travel through the state . &quot;
in 2015 , Mis@@ souri posted 100 Hass@@ elt , according to the latest figures from Hass@@ elt &apos;s crime programme , as well as in terms of the number of violations of the country &apos;s number of violations in the 16th .
the travel is also a reply to a new Mis@@ souri law that would make it difficult to give a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
before the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) , the American Civil Liber@@ ties ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had adopted amend@@ ments to the local en@@ forcement agencies to dis@@ grace people because of confidence , which is to contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U view .
travel openings are generally issued by the State Department for other countries , but in the last time , stakeholders have the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends in the US .
Wei@@ de@@ z@@ aun@@ ching project is elementary
the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher Wei@@ de@@ ki@@ n project is a successful project and continued to be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundestag member Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have turned on site a picture .
in the juris@@ pru@@ dence of the Schwen@@ demann , representatives of Fisch@@ erb@@ acher CD@@ U National Association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two ME@@ Ps .
Markus Schwen@@ demann , initially granted insights into its operation where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and equally many young cows and five apartments of holiday houses .
the &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milk &quot; is for him of the alternative energy @-@ market path for the milk of his cows , such as Schwen@@ demann .
at the table of the holiday resorts only region@@ als comes exclusively regional .
since it is also the BL@@ HV @-@ president of Fish@@ bach , he called the Wei@@ de@@ z@@ aun@@ ant project as &quot; elementary ar . &quot;
I can not be used on so steep areas .
the green area of green space for a lot of work , much to be processed with the sense .
&quot; we have found here with the conditions and top@@ ography with the top@@ ography , &quot; said Schwen@@ demann .
in 2003 , he acquired the ter@@ restrial operation and has acquired this without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even though he does not lead to bio @-@ operation .
for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commune , the importance of the Wei@@ de@@ z@@ aun@@ ching project is recognized and was joy@@ ful of the leader . &quot;
at cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , the farmers would have to be supported .
we hope that the fo@@ rest@@ or@@ ations of the surfaces could still be prevented a whole while .
&quot; the biggest treasure in which we have , are the people who work in agriculture , and how they continue to bring out her operations , &quot; stressed the Mayor .
farmers are often used due to support in the criticism
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were used in the Wei@@ de@@ z@@ aun@@ Development Fund in 2013 .
the dis@@ closure area amounts to 40 hectares , which may not be adjusted to at least 20@@ 23 .
the half of the total costs of 71 500 euros was funded by the total cost of 71 500 , a quarter @-@ district contributed the Municipality of Fish@@ bach .
thus , farmers will love the farmers 12 610 Euro , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the Z@@ ä@@ une , &quot; says Schwen@@ demann .
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac emphas@@ ised : &quot; it does not make a right job , without farmers and land women do not go . &quot;
also for Peter Weiß : &quot; here is best food produced . &quot;
the State Court Act ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state promotion of Wei@@ de@@ fun@@ dus .
the objective is the offen@@ ded of Schwar@@ zw@@ ald .
the requirement is the presence of an evaluation of L@@ PR &apos;s sponsors .
furthermore , the un@@ compromising area cannot be managed ( hang@@ ar above 35 percent ) and must be threatened by the request .
for the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher Wei@@ de@@ z@@ aun@@ ching project 2018 currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build 16 kilometres of fence .
the open maintenance area is 35 hectares , the cold cost is of more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing holy ?
now , the White House of Tr@@ um@@ bling the Statue of Liberty .
the saf@@ est sign of a regime switch is it if they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate these equally as any other - hence the tor@@ ate was staged at the fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bagh@@ dad .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ent regime , knew what he did , when he did a symbolic ax@@ e in a heat rec@@ itals with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CNN about the proposals of the president for dr@@ astic limitation of the legal migration to the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller is not the statue itself .
a hor@@ des of boat sh@@ aded by boat and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators have experienced him when he had done it .
but he also took of their significance , and in particular the importance that was attributed to her , when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus , 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument was added .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ain@@ able : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty has ... an icon of American freedom , which is over the world .
the poem , which you refer to which , was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is consistent right , but as he told it , it does not really know about history .
it goes to the performance of the contemporary reson@@ ance of Lazarus , the only ones , in which a state does not only invite any other immigrants , but the poo@@ rest of the poor : &quot; your poor , your poor , and your poor masses that are looking to breathe consciously , nor breathe consciously , / the el@@ essly of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time , in which the &quot; el@@ ect of tr@@ ash &quot; was better to see our screens .
Miller is not committed in literary criticism - it made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural engagement : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends , who prepared themselves to place their words following her death at the base , did not know that she had been a high @-@ political action by her death .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American @-@ American Repub@@ lic@@ ism by putting them in an ab@@ used classical picture the female Em@@ bodied Communication .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in its poem , the female figure is no more abstract - she has received a voice .
and she himself is a very different name : mother of ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection of the di@@ zation with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and exactly how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people wanted to change the people from the right wing as long .
the great write of Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John of the Bapti@@ st , argued that the Statue of Liberty was inserted , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , who bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is prog@@ ressing .
it should bear the f@@ ack@@ el of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the f@@ ack@@ el is not the way to dis@@ connect the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on a somewhat unusual .
the importance of the statue is quite and even a question of perception of perception .
the great phant@@ asi@@ ev@@ olle from Lazarus , they were to see how it was seen from the exhaus@@ tive , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips to the Dec@@ ks of ships .
it is in the true sense that the world goes out of the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve a chance to improve their lives .
your statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome you to hear them .
and that is , of course , do not recognize the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ashi ever .
your f@@ ack@@ el is not the way to break the way , but the hatred that is the only source of power is lit .
world championship 2017 : Neil Black Do@@ es Scottish members of the United Kingdom
Ei@@ li@@ ie Do@@ yle is reminiscent of a time when there were only two car@@ rots for the team of Britain .
the performance Director of the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of the world champion &quot; has a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom have to learn something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue to continue until we find it out , &quot; said Black .
&quot; I say to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and think they think that there have something to do with what they did . &quot;
Scottish athletes remember that it has something to do with what they did .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they did .
and even with the type of street corner .
whatever the combination of the circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals from medals , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ cher , who compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah , while the Ei@@ li@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected to the team &apos;s team captain .
&quot; Ei@@ li@@ ie is fairly modest .
her chapter &apos;s speech was incredibly , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , regardless of whether they were of gravel or , wherever they live , they went out of the room , and felt very proud and were very motiv@@ ated .
the passion and genuine feeling , the Ei@@ li@@ ie were all of course , was great . &quot;
the Commonwealth silver medal winner in which the fifth world champion in the 400 @-@ metre hur@@ dle is said that it is &quot; incredibly &quot; that 16 car@@ rots in the British team are .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the world championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle distance of Mu@@ ir takes place on this path and has set up two European records in the past five years .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5.000 m L@@ earn .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 square is running , is another shame that one should watch out the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle is reminiscent of its first world championships , when the only other Sch@@ otte appeared in the Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the capitalist Capit@@ an said that she is &quot; an enorm@@ ously proud &quot; on the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots not only belong to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the fin@@ alists .
&quot; the exceptional team captain is to be found that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour , but to know that my team @-@ mate was voted for me and voted for me , &quot; added it to something special for me . &quot;
&quot; apparently I am very proud of all the car@@ rots that belong to the team . &quot;
it shows just how far we come .
and they are here as established athlete , athletes who want to rise to Po@@ wers .
what would be my speech to be the captain in this ?
yes , I think she went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy at this situation , since we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to set this exercise support and benefit from that we are back in the Olympic stadium .
I get a second chance to go to go and compete , and it is simply as a great atmosphere since there . &quot;
block from critics over Facebook : Be@@ et@@ b don &apos;t get to a public office if you don &apos;t want to wear the vot@@ ers of vot@@ ers .
the father of our country , knew something of bad press .
the Americans of George Washington , but it wasn &apos;t long until the newspapers took him because of all , from the Domestic Policy up to his political principles .
he sch@@ im@@ pr@@ ated with the criticism , safe .
however , he has not brought his critics .
as in 1783 , Washington said , &quot; the Rede@@ emer can be taken away - and , stu@@ pid , and silent , we become the sheep to the slaughter . &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to Governor of Larry Ho@@ gan , who has to work out to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and delete their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties union accused him therefore at the beginning of this week .
the staff of the govern@@ ors left the law@@ suit , and the online commentary was full of a reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it is a type of Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amazing .
he has the second highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is no re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
he has shown a fixed hand at the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as the primary means to connect to his vot@@ ers and play his ha@@ j@@ ob@@ less head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the block@@ age of people who come on the site &apos;s site - that is a public forum , which is officially called by employees who paid off with public tax dollar - un@@ necessary and finally dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the govern@@ ors and argued that the blocking of the comments was nothing more than a present@@ ation .
but it &apos;s easy to use the image of tro@@ uts or split or h@@ ass@@ ment people to use the P@@ eit@@ s online .
the Post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and that &apos;s just true people who speak with their chosen leaders - a teacher , an entrepreneur and a pastor , no tro@@ ll .
they all told that their comments resp@@ ect@@ ful , clearly and not prof@@ iting .
the pastor came to the Bible in his post and app@@ eals to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
attorney at Lak@@ sh@@ mi F@@ lan@@ ma Ram@@ ani von Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not h@@ ass@@ ent , but she was asked to hate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented that I was dis@@ appointed that there was no reaction to Hass@@ elt and other latest news , &quot; wrote in the commentary area of the news release &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I guess that idea is not even if a number of people on the same topic , they will be used by some more than a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
regarding the employee &apos;s staff , &quot; concentrated spam attack , &quot; other likely would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to remove a message , simply by simply define a critic or a negative comment .
it is much clean than in a former time when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn , to burn or burn @-@ to @-@ burn or demonstr@@ ators .
but exactly what happened is digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public officials that critic@@ ises Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ent is accused by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter Feed .
one of the first mile@@ stones in Virginia could last week in Virginia .
the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County ver@@ last the First A@@ men@@ d@@ ment , according to the U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when it served a vot@@ ers from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt . in ( R ) also received a visit to AC@@ L@@ U because of its use by Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the moment of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers is related to his leadership between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter , over@@ clo@@ cked his lead .
and even then Washington had an anonymous con@@ spic@@ uous .
people who have pseu@@ don@@ y@@ me like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ cio &quot; signed all letters of newspapers , Washington &apos;s decisions made .
Peti@@ tions , who have critici@@ zed its position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping of the United Kingdom to have passed over the historical documents that were collected by the online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not brought them to the silence .
expression , differences of opinion and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership , which means to accept .

it is a rare insight into the daily life in the Hochland of Papua , a former Dutch colony that was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 El@@ ders should vote against the occupying troops .
an existing movement , which turned out for independence against the Dutch rule , turned over to the government of Jakarta , which includes control of the region , and foreign journalists and foreign journalists .
in 2003 , the province has been divided into Papua New Guinea , and the independent part of Papua New Guinea that included the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so steep as it &apos;s . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura after Nab@@ ire and then a mor@@ atorium 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there are no public transportation links .
the city of approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wood houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo tre@@ bles are surrounded and from cor@@ rug@@ ated roofs that were converted into different yellow brown sounds .
only a few Indon@@ esians have made their journey here , spot@@ ted because journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries came to name Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to wear this clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and indicates their lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirts , and its bright rock . &quot;

Papua , Indonesia &apos;s poo@@ rest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s bodies and the alpha@@ be@@ ti@@ bility rates in Asia .
but it is also Indon@@ esians Gold@@ land .
the largest and profitable Gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , located only 60 miles from P@@ ani@@ ai , a high school province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has to take part in the value of € 3.1 billion and copper to copper .
in addition , Papua has a wood resources , estimated $ 78 billion in the amount of $ 78 billion .
however , this rich@@ ness , however , are a source of the mis@@ ery of Papua New Guinea that conve@@ ying that Indon@@ esians is to preser@@ ves a military presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local military officers and units sold nearly 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150,000 US dollars on a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anic demands after major autonomy of this golden G@@ ans and are treated gn@@ ome .
according to activists of activists , more than 500,000 Papua were killed and thousands were killed since 1969 by the Indonesian military , tortured and imprisoned .

it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week &apos;s inci@@ dents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the bolts are reinforced , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts Indon@@ esians .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83 % Christian , but the demographic development changes to the most popul@@ ous islands of Java , Borneo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .

the former Zimmermann is 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua , including P@@ ani@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .
but in Papua New Guinea has changed little ones and today , the locals are st@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts are broken , since we did in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the anticip@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes , &quot; says you .
in fact , P@@ ani@@ ai suffered two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October a low@@ point .
on December 7 , 2014 a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas Car@@ ols in a bon@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the children they told them that they were able to turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers participated in their sound and came later with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had dr@@ unk , hunt , and sm@@ ashed the group with their ri@@ fl@@ ashes , offered victims and witnesses .
then , one of the soldiers met in the children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Yu@@ li@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was heavily defeated that he fell into the Comintern .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government Commission was set in fire and the things dar@@ ali@@ ated on the next day .
approximately 1,000 young Papua New men , women and children gathered themselves on a football field in front of the local police station and the military forces to request justice .
she contributed to em@@ bodied Jag@@ db@@ f@@ gen and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - in the circle and a bir@@ d@@ song - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago .
a number of demonstr@@ ators started to police on police and military post .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command to an internal radio : &quot; if the masses was more than three times , they hold dead , &quot; said it was dead in an official document of TIM@@ E , which was not approved in the local media .
Y@@ er@@ emi@@ as Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger , and called for tranqu@@ ility and demanded the amount of home .
no one was heard in the mood .
&quot; when I shot , I shot himself in my lin@@ kes in my lin@@ kes , &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the porch of its b@@ unt wooden building . &quot;
Kay@@ ame knows still not yet , who has , but says that the ball from the ranks were gathered here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times in three times , his cousin , the witness of the shooting .
&quot; I went out to him , and looked for his body to go sure that he was , &quot; Y@@ oh@@ anes , who just like many Indon@@ esians , who only bears a name of the TIM@@ E in dunes .
&quot; I saw that he was dead was dead ... I have sho@@ cked him . &quot;
the Che@@ fin@@ spec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said Rep@@ or@@ ters said that his officers wanted to fight their station just &quot; secure &quot; because they will be attacked .
&quot; we have to defend if people are threatening to kill us , &quot; said the spokesperson of Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 .
it &apos;s going to life and death . &quot;
according to human Rights Watch were killed five young protest@@ ers and injured .
the messages about the kill@@ ings came only at the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jakarta .
three weeks was Jok@@ ow@@ i in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura a passionate speech , where he sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and pregnant , and pregnant as the historical circumstances in Papua New Zealand .
&quot; I want to be resolved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said .
security minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he was a non @-@ judicial mechanism for the creation of historical human rights violations in October 2016 .
but the out@@ bound began in almost immediately .
most injuries occurred before a long time .
some were in the 90 @-@ year @-@ old and the beginning of the 2000 years .
the point is that we have committed to go to us , but there are processes that go through , &quot; he said .
then , Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he talked on 5 June in Jakarta with TIM@@ E and said he had no plans to establish a complaint in Papua New York .
instead , &quot; everything was regulated by the law , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto who accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s independence of independence in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua were already included , including the P@@ ani@@ ai @-@ Vor@@ um .
families of the P@@ ani@@ ai victims , such claims are opposed to a fi@@ er@@ ce un@@ eas@@ iness .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I was afraid of being shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ti repeated the view that people in P@@ ani@@ ai fear have to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the military , after he helped him to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I was buried the dead , the army sought after me , &quot; he says .
the bro@@ ods have not heard .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police attacked the village of P@@ ani@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between the village and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a collective husband to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dr@@ unk in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
the vill@@ agers prot@@ ested the company &apos;s site office in front of the company .
the police said that the half of the vill@@ agers of the army were cast into officers , who re@@ acted using a warning .
but locals say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian paramilit@@ ary police ) began to shoot a lot of shooting and killed .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who resi@@ des in the hospital , and witness to the last time , the TIM@@ E was so fast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hidden two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called for being called to withdraw the officers of the officers and to withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police .
P@@ ani@@ ai was always an un@@ ru@@ h@@ ott@@ d for the Indonesian government .
the lack of sustainable development strength@@ ens the un@@ satisfaction of the tribal @-@ related medals , Mon@@ i , D@@ ani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ land of Papua New .
many included the &quot; Free Papua movement ( OP@@ M ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua New Guinea that they are spor@@ adic attacks and demonstrations by Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top OP@@ M leaders originate from P@@ ani@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ des Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to thousands of people in P@@ ani@@ ai , thousands of people were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; protection of national sovereignty . &quot;
some dive again .
among the people in Papua New is P@@ ani@@ ai as &quot; a portable , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty , the un@@ happiness .
the little rice which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is sold for locals too expensive .
bread is just outside .
the people build here , what they eat : especially not@@ ans and fruit and pure foli@@ ation .
the agriculture is the task of women , each with four or five fields of liqu@@ ori@@ co@@ ils .
they keep the majority of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold to the local market .

during the period , economic differences between the native of Papua and the new migrants have grown steadily since the opening of the hub in the hub in the hub of the umbi@@ li@@ tion airport .
the few jobs , which there is in the region , usually in which better @-@ educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
Papua , the capital or the necessary capabilities to lead their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in the village ... because there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the P@@ ani@@ ai .
insulation keeps the eyes of Papua the world .
furthermore , the reporting of the reporting international media will be banned .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of insufficient coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they have been given the rare permission to the films .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises made by Jok@@ ow@@ is elect@@ oral campaign to encourage transparency and development , not realized .
there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indon@@ esians , most peaceful provinces of Papua and West Col : visa @-@ refusal to report a black list , &quot; he said in a statement .
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbors Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six paci@@ fic states - T@@ onga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council on which the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua , including the P@@ ani@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically seen the OP@@ M .
the spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r pointed out the accus@@ ations of the group and said , &quot; in Indonesia still a democratic system , and there is free media , making it difficult to prevent evidence for human rights violations . &quot;
people want to go on site that more foreign governments go to the knowledge .
as a official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura captured her , and ur@@ ged him , &quot; We would like freedom , &quot; according to a source which would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has a further presidential election , but the Papua New Guinea that they are probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but it is surrounded by people that are involved in the P@@ ani@@ ai Sch@@ uts , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal @-@ Council .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , apart from that it is among the constant threat of a serious military , lives in arm@@ our and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , like other Papua , had to consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as one &quot; guil@@ t that he must pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need money you want only justice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of the threats and in@@ scrip@@ tions , families of P@@ ani@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ i has a final symbolic act of peace : the Lei@@ che of a O@@ pf@@ ers was buried on a area exactly opposite the police and military station .
you may know that maybe I will never be righteousness , but at least , they don &apos;t forget the officers for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ bus with the head .
&quot; what can we do otherwise ? &quot;
capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire place on Friday in one of the highest residential doors in the world in Dubai , we have hundreds of inhabitants , from the 337 m high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire which is in just two years through the Hoch@@ haus , which is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there were no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we sle@@ pt away and we have stood at the Fire alarm and write the people .
we crossed the steps down , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50th floor to below , &quot; told a inhabitants who named his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the units of the fire protection against 4.@@ 00 local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) will be heated to the fire and cool the building .

the incident may be used for safety of materials that are used in external areas around the world .
an investigation by management of the Tor@@ ch building , according to its Brand in 2015 , revealed that the largest part of the damage caused by the clothing , the exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or isolation .
in Great Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ fell tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June , about 80 people died .

at the session in Ho Chi Minh City , the Davis Cup proposal has been developed for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup entries only to play on two pay@@ sets , is not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
although it is often very long , but also therefore very estimated five @-@ sentence @-@ classic remain in the traditional tool .
6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of the member states voting for the reform , the goal of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore just missed .
&quot; we resp@@ ects this decision , but are dis@@ appointed that our members are not the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these icon@@ ographic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ g@@ ty .
you will continue to continue to improve the applic@@ ants .
not only for the vote , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , the proposal came to the final on a neutral resort .

to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in training places , etc . , and players will need to complete their official media way ahead of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 U.S. travelers brings you to the plane , a survey found out of a survey .
a survey conducted among passengers , that more than 20 per cent live or un@@ affected items to the control points of U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent , including the airplane , while they acci@@ dentally put together , or other objects with Klin@@ gen .
less than 1 percent claimed that they were later re@@ discovered that they have walked with pl@@ uss@@ ing weapons , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives .
the survey conducted by more than 1,000 people - who was carried out by a jet Char@@ ter@@ service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ge Inc . , was also noted that younger travelers had rather than the rules .
of the respondents said that they have tried to fly with something , which was forbidden by T@@ SA , at 19.@@ 7 percent of the Millennium Tar@@ get , compared with less than 15 percent , members of the Generation X were forbidden .
the most common objects that were given to T@@ SA agents , were confident , foods and liquids .
more than 3 per cent gave to know each items with the security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents also confirmed that it would be given out @-@ out drugs to the plane .
the company said , I have asked travellers throughout the country to figure out how many acci@@ dentally put s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware by the airport security and how many could have done it .
it is no surprise that people who bear the most ab@@ s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware - know @-@ aware or un@@ discovered - through the safety , those were the most frequently flying .
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines somewhat complicated and confused with it .
people are often un@@ certain that are allowed to take them or how much of it .
so , it &apos;s no surprise that the largest amount of T@@ SA decides to be burnt down objects .
a long time thought the people who could see books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware .

El@@ on Mus@@ k is it either : tens of thousands of Tesla customers .

so far , he has so far propose that a part of the customer has returned their un@@ binding reservation back again .
in addition to the always stable figures , Tesla CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k announced the first quarter of the recent quarterly results for the first time a different , less smooth @-@ full number : the canc@@ ell@@ ations with the new mass market @-@ model 3 .
in the past months , Mus@@ k had frequently used more than 500,000 new@@ comer for the new car , whose extradition begins .
now , Mus@@ k one : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 cases , 6@@ 3,000 has been with@@ drawn back again .
critic had always noted that it is only a binding reservations .
in a cancellation , Tesla will pay € 1000 ( in the US $ 1000 and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently , 45@@ ,000 such un@@ binding reservations before , Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the cancellation &apos;s canc@@ eling is about 12 percent of all orders for the problem , however , the Tesla boss could not be .
his argument : the challenge at the ambitious growth target is not close to demand , but on the output side .
last year , Tesla had supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , it will be taken - all models - 500,000 , 2020 is one million .
demand is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k currently , there are 1800 reservations .
if you have ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; at the earliest in the second half of 2018 , if Tesla was able to take delivery of the brand new , never before the start of production roads without larger inter@@ ruption with maximum utilization .
many experts are doubts that it is possible .
however , it comes to larger del@@ ays , then could be the un@@ binding the reservations required to Tesla .
because then the company can &apos;t be aware of the company un@@ satisfied customers , in Sch@@ aren da@@ from@@ .
EPA leader P@@ ru@@ itt moves to reducing the emissions of Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reducing the emissions of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a .
one day , after having been accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , had left its previous decision to reduce the implementation of the Obama era by reducing the emissions of Smo@@ g causing air poll@@ ut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to meet the needs of the state environmental authorities to re@@ acts faster than the previous attack .
he mentioned the law@@ suit against his previous year in a German Federal Constitutional Court .
it &apos;s about a deadline which ran on October 1st for states to hold the standards from 2015 for ground @-@ level o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June , in order to return to a year , in order to study more time to study the plan to study the plan , and to avoid , &quot; in local decisions , or economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ General of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent ( environmental protection ) .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt repeated under@@ way to block the chemical industry and del@@ aying the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the youngest legal provisions for the P@@ ru@@ ple regular @-@ back Agenda .
last month , a federal court in Washington has decided that the EPA did not have exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies to monitoring the reduction of meth@@ an@@ le@@ cks .
in one on Wednesday evening statement , P@@ ru@@ itt reported that his K@@ ehr@@ t@@ wende in o@@ zone standards quite simply the read@@ iness of EPA for cooperation with the states caused by the complex process of the new standards .
&quot; under earlier devast@@ ation , the EPA often would be tried and finally charged , and in an agreement reached the date , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation through trial procedure , and we take Fri@@ end@@ seriously .
we also take the law and the authority , which gives us serious . &quot;
nevertheless , the opinion from the EPA &apos;s opinion that P@@ ru@@ itt wanted to make his &quot; powers to delay and all other legally available , &quot; to ensure that the regulations &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , pushing onto a more comprehensive novel@@ ty of the Oz@@ on@@ rules .
a bill in the last month was to delay the implementation of the rules for at least eight years .
the measure was not allowed to vote in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric T@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of the states that compl@@ ains the EPA in this week , said the Group agreed to justify the statutory pressure .
&quot; the return of the EPA - according to our Kl@@ ages - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New York and about 115 million Americans who are affected by the Smo@@ g , &quot; said dress@@ making . &quot;

&quot; it is un@@ qui@@ eter , how much pressure is needed to get this reasonable step by the officers for the protection of the air that we receive in@@ hale , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Divers@@ ity .

association wants to check out of Win@@ dr@@ ä@@ ders
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim took out &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; for the construction and has therefore turned into the landing .
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim is asked &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take his approval to the construction of planned wind power plants in the Bo@@ ish@@ eim N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association argued that at the time of the approval of December 30 , 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ on N@@ ette , there was no wind turbines at the time , because at the time of the city border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal has existed a wind power concentration zone .
within this concentration area , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , the concentration area causes a concentration of wind power use for the rest of the city .
zones are supposed to prevent a &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
a few days previously , the town of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power station in the Bo@@ ish@@ on N@@ ette , but the government had not approved the District government in Düsseldorf , because of a formations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by the lack of legal requirement is the official approval of the approval , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the city appeared again before the summer break again the wind concentration camp in the Bo@@ ish@@ on N@@ ette . a approval from the District government stands out .
Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; this is the approval of a licence for the establishment of wind energy systems planned . &quot;
the circle confirms the input of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding writing have been recorded for last week for last week , &quot; says a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes again to test the affair again .
however , they are likely not to do that the procedure is stopped .
with a look at the ongoing procedure of the administrative court , the circle wanted to move forward to the arguments of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NE@@ W Re , a subsidiary of NE@@ W , plans to build on a surface at the Bo@@ ish@@ on N@@ ette design to the construction of four each 200 metres high winds .
last year , the company already had a company in which the city of Vier@@ sen is involved in the town of quad@@ rant , with the owner of about 65 hectares of large area .
with construction of four wind turbines , the electricity demand of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to around one @-@ fifth of all four quad@@ rant households .
the NE@@ W Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vi@@ ers@@ ed Stad@@ thalle gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the wind farm Lin@@ nich at Aachen and a participation in the wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in circle Hein@@ sberg .

Moo@@ res Ford massacres : activists lead ra@@ ci@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice once again
a 1948 @-@ 1999 Ford Mercury was founded by a group of people in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and r@@ ump@@ ed on the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , the bridge could reach a group of white men with tissues , to block his way to block .
the leader of the M@@ ob - a man in medium @-@ age in a con@@ i@@ strate - took a long train to his cig@@ ar and looking at the wind@@ screen &apos;s wind@@ screen .
dr@@ ens the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to have this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the husband of the husband . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ol him out of the car ! &quot;
Schre@@ ie cr@@ ush the silence , than a young black man from the passenger seat .
luck@@ ily , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , only a reproduction .
but when then a loop around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; is thrown , silent , nearly all of the audience very genuine S@@ eu@@ f@@ zer .
since 2005 the Ford Bridge has come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , with the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com , as well as George and Mae Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was indicted because of the murders .
&quot; it is really unbe@@ atable that , in all these years , though we have not been arrested in our communities , although we know what they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ cade , who helps with the organization of re@@ plen@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a load of our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ cade is a 71 @-@ year old former senior Congress of Georgia , and a life of civil rights .
for him , the re@@ mission is to re@@ acts as a dramatic call to the action , and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that an accident was never correc@@ ted .
&quot; we want to en@@ forcement , we want the dis@@ termin@@ ation , we want healing for healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; we can &apos;t get healing for healing and reconciliation , until we will get justice . &quot;
a judicial authorities puts a s@@ ack@@ cloth over the bodies of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ne on 27 July 1946 .
according to the FBI , which were obtained from N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e , and the surrounding discussions were suspected of the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but nobody was thus indicted .
although the susp@@ ects have been on free entry for decades , civil rights activists say that the motivation for Lyn@@ ch @-@ actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court assigned to the black citizens of Georgia in Georgia , to give her voice to the voting competition in the summer of 1946 .
approximately at the same time as the election according to the FBI of the Black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com include a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nice H@@ ester , during a struggle , allegedly because of a woman .
bro@@ oks said , the rum@@ or of the city was that H@@ ester with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y had sle@@ pt and that the baby that brought them , not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from prison , as the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her cou@@ sins of Mae Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they removed from the prison complex and the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b reached the car .
&quot; as it turned out , it was Harrison who prepared the Mor@@ de and arranged , &quot; closes up from one of the FBI .
&quot; it is also obvious that it was a complete between the state and local criminal prosecution that was not only involved in the murders , the evidence and the identity of witnesses did . &quot;
bro@@ oks it still form@@ ative .
&quot; it was a voting rights , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register to register before and when you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
almost a decade ago , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has directed the annual follow @-@ up of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
its representation is vivid , erg@@ istic and is justified in a kind of profound rac@@ ism , from which many believe that he does not exist in America .
it &apos;s hard to look to look and even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is .
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ n , because we are confronted with its ha@@ w@@ ess in us , &quot; said she said .
&quot; but I can &apos;t know any relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to hear me or hear , what I have done . &quot;
the samples of this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , almost 30 actors , a dozen White and the rest black - in a room and lau@@ dry , as Gre@@ ene started a good overview over the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is Gre@@ etings Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ mit@@ gli@@ de for years , but he said that role will never be easier .
&quot; I feel dirty , because I don &apos;t I am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story on life because we want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the book , actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nice H@@ ester .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester an@@ sh@@ it and ur@@ ged him to make him that he sle@@ pt with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wear out of my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona er@@ wi@@ red the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least every black actor ) in the watch@@ man comes from .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the end .
&quot; what ? ! ! , &quot; Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ ar@@ med and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ ich@@ y .
&quot; I think I don &apos;t believe that white people at that time &apos; n --- &apos; said . &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; funny one of the other black but@@ ing .
&quot; you need to make the hard &apos; R. &apos; meeting . &quot;
and exactly that postp@@ ones the energy in the room , a feeling of camera will replace the un@@ eas@@ iness .
everyone is busy , this is not only added because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins once again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no laugh@@ s .
these repeti@@ tion ends in violent and fast .
there are Schre@@ ie , shots and then silence .
a woman , with a fun@@ eral @-@ dress , stands on the body of actors , and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays to sing praise &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
their voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred metres behind me , a group of about four dozen spectators are silence and Tränen aus the eyes .
the audience is almost ev@@ enly between black and white .
a couple is from Ith@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come just down the street .
they all have almost eight hours of Georgia , when bro@@ oks they take on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bst@@ ones of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point the Mor@@ de offers a an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if one stands on the same country , where Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air must be donated to the air .
when the latest notes of the songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and the body name too .
children ho@@ cks in her heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and fle@@ dged each other .
&quot; they are not really dead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ ber a small boy , when he believed to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a couple of minutes , Gre@@ ene of the quantity and suddenly is over .
the actors look the Lyn@@ ch@@ eil and wi@@ pe her tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw , Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the C@@ lan@@ a .
Nick Ras@@ cona um@@ ar@@ mt two of his co @-@ player and breaks up in their arms , and in her arms , the emotional result was finally faced with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; escap@@ es one of women .
we know that it is not in your heart . &quot;
you have done it out of a reason . &quot;
later , the audience puts together with the actor for dinner together .
a white pair of Atlanta , which is excited to a table with a black pair , which they have just met with a black pair .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought with the words to find out what the performance has left the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these horri@@ fic words and deeds ... of people who look like you look like and do that do , because they look like , &quot; said she said . &quot;
&quot; what really does that really do with me , I believe that the Lyn@@ n is still going on , &quot; added them , &quot; today it is called the only police shooting . &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ ose Bro@@ dy court hold on his table , he and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the reproduction is in a certain way , because she describes the fear of what we bear , but it is also a moment of the learning &quot; said he said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s so if we do not learn about this , then it can happen again .
who did not know his own story , who does not know his own story , he is sentenced to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ ter@@ d@@ ämm@@ erung &quot; con@@ cili@@ atory the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , Frank Cast@@ orf works on a b@@ unt @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e production before the giant , six @-@ storey backdrop .
the screen@@ stage ( arranged by Aleks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) also shows a low @-@ above street corner and L@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and elast@@ omer &quot; logo from GDR @-@ times or the New York Stock Exchange .
in front of a open Mercedes @-@ Benz car , in which the R@@ hen@@ ger@@ min@@ ers as a rock @-@ girls , or alternatively an is@@ etta .
gest@@ ed oil rou@@ ters remember Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ mo@@ tiv - Money , Power and Gi@@ er - which moves through its &quot; Ring &quot; production .
the three R@@ hen@@ ans - ges@@ tions by Stephanie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ic like already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
K@@ ess ver@@ ed her Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , zer@@ oes in Hollywood @-@ Mani@@ er a body in the trunk room and giving the Kra@@ Wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glori@@ fying Hagen , which gives the A@@ ura of a heav@@ y@@ weights .
brut@@ ally , the scene , when he shi@@ ped out .
later , Gun@@ ther also must believe in favor of Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) .
the audience came in the ensemble with a strong appl@@ ause .
on the stor@@ y@@ one , Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke , and conductor Jan@@ owski , who resi@@ sted in modest and hands on the Merkel &apos;s smokers .
big inser@@ ts there is for the Fest@@ spiel@@ Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the big heat back in le@@ ak amusement parks .
the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his head team .
in 2013 he had to go over a g@@ ellen@@ ic concert in 2013 , five years later , there were big Ju@@ bel , in which the single &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; Ru@@ fe appeared .
the Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is likely to be pleased to announce that .
&quot; it is noticeable that the audience has grown to the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; had said she had been in short before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
the audience had not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also a understanding of vision of vision .
I am a positive res@@ ume .
max amount works as volunteers
they work on several sites in their volunteers at the same time .
wherever you everywhere ?
amount : normally in Stein@@ furt , Furniture manufacturer , once a week in Gre@@ ven , I will find here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have worked at the school in an open @-@ day school .
how do you experience your experiences ?
amount : it is a nice , broad spectrum , which I see here .
I do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , i.e. a late working volunteers .
how does that ?
amount : I made S@@ LC .
and then , engineering studies , we say times , are successful .
I intended for me to me that it &apos;s for me , and I want to make some other things to work with people .
and then I asked me to do you .
Mach a socialist year , since there is an insight , as it can see , as it is before , in the focal point perhaps too , really is .
and it was so ?
amount : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my degree in the winter term in the winter term .
I will study dual education , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social worker education and trained in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule .
is it not something unusual , during the volunteer &apos;s volunteer to have several different applications ?
lot : yes , it is very variable .
it is probably always aware of where you will be the FS@@ J .
from retirement home to Ju@@ gen@@ dar@@ ing work - in all possible fac@@ ets of the social work .
I was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the after@@ market support .
for me , that was exactly the right thing to do me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs .
unlike in civil engineering ?
amount : well , here it &apos;s not to calculate st@@ ati@@ ken .
one has always visited other people around the head , each one another in each other history .
whether a refugee , whether a youth , who has been picked up out of the family - one must be individually adapted to one .
very interesting .
and they don &apos;t have touch @-@ screen ?
amount : this is not the type .
there is a range that there is a lot of experience .
plenty of love , plenty of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but so that lives .

EPA returns to delay the delay of the smo@@ g rule after c@@ ages .
the US @-@ American environmental protection authority has a decision to delay the government of Obama , repe@@ aled the states that Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions are committed . this was a day after 15 states confirmed the agency because of the trial .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Rules 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commitment of the agency to work with States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we believe in the dialogue with and recall that we react to our state partners , &quot; said EPA &apos;s boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement .
P@@ ru@@ itt , in June , the intention of the EPA announced that zone o@@ zone had to be measured in a part of the country of poll@@ ut@@ ations , to prevent them to prevent further ten@@ oning air quality standards - to be delayed by a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 predominantly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday , saying that the effort was illeg@@ ally illegal .
the president of President Donald Tr@@ ent has tried to pass a wide range of environmental awareness , former president of Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda that could travel to Tr@@ ent economic growth .
however , efforts have caused the response of the Democrats and nature protection groups , concerns about the impact of greater emissions to public health .

joint venture wants to be shared space
at the end , the decision was clearly reflected in two counter @-@ vote , the church of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ er decides to establish a common space in the future senior residence .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing basic piece is signed , Mayor Bernard Tj@@ aden .
although it is still going to take part in the Church &apos;s church , but there is no plans for the community of a private investors so far , there is no plans for the community .
there is a discussion about a joint space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat , are offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor , it would be a living space - around 55 square meters - and a adjoining terrace with at least 70 square meters area for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the church is Swedish , such a common room was not just as the meeting point only for the inhabitants of sen@@ i@@ zing housing , but to the church in the church .
for example , the word made by the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; for the round .
in this autumn , the decision , which was chosen by the provision of funding for the current budget was already decided in the last autumn .
the building is in the renovation area .
the installation of a common space were , &quot; Tj@@ aden , &quot; says Tj@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the decision to sign@@ aling an investor is that , in this regard , there is no ful@@ min@@ ent in this regard to the environmental protection - as well as P@@ ult@@ on - which reduces the tr@@ ash height and the construction of economic power - are not possible .
unnecessary , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , is this addition .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passed the body .
it is not so easy to use in common room .
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own building , with which you do not want to change so right now in the common room of the window , she says : &quot; I do not make me hard to play . &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger speaks of the common room in common room , but absolutely against a public participation .

four ver@@ ge after tire board
at an accident on the A7 , four people were badly damaged in the afternoon .
after the first information lost the driver of a Opel Zafira Tourer 16.@@ 30 pm shortly before the market place , presumably the control of its vehicle is thought to be placed after a tire board .
the passenger car , to the right into the arch@@ es , where he stroke and then remained on the roof in the green strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were badly damaged during the accident .
during the first supply of the final through the rescue service , the A7 towards the north for about an hour was closed , then the traffic on the left strip of the acci@@ dental office could be carried out .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; tri@@ angles works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes to the start of 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener in Braunschweig , that the optimization of def@@ ensive formation will take place in Au@@ e points .
with the first match of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , because there was not the two powers at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; this was two counter@@ s too much , and we have to fit into Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ ensive player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf .
in the Erz@@ gebirge , the tri@@ angles should also be optimised .
and a gate after a free trial , the Fort@@ ress do not want to fall more .
&quot; for the future it will be so that no more addition to Michael ( R@@ ensing ) is present on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team also comes to the experience in preparation with the tri@@ erk@@ ette better than with the quad@@ ru@@ ette .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what we will be in au@@ e , &quot; says his Trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we just have in the Thir@@ d@@ ette in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; the requirement is , but that we still feel better harmon@@ ic and we have to make us in the structure not as many un@@ pack errors . &quot;
of course , Hoffmann drives to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; if one could say , however , after a lack of sl@@ sl@@ ated start , don &apos;t know that .
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; if we are going on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the cup , we will surely speak of a regular seasonal season . &quot;
it didn &apos;t know nothing to know his coach .
&quot; the start into the season I only have six to eight days of games , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who would not want to talk about an advantage over an advantage , because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken down because of an accident .
&quot; now you can start the season with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the player might be maybe even a bit of fresh@@ ness , as they don &apos;t have a heavy game like Fort@@ una against a asc@@ ension of the bones in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 per cent where they are currently , &quot; says the inner def@@ ending of Fort@@ una .
while the guests from the Rhineland as a lighter favorite on Sunday are on Sunday ( almost ) the stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we are taking away because we are entitled to come under the first six , is Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ sense , &quot; says Funk@@ el , the balance sheet with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games .
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , the one has to beat out by pre @-@ coach . &quot;
&quot; one such testimony was to meet ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ t and over@@ Hebrew . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el will experience his player on Sunday on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum seek@@ ers
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method to evaluate their age , more than 80 percent of all tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes that accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic medicine ( hard medi@@ cin@@ al@@ tim@@ et ) has started with the implementation of tests in the past year .
during the asylum process that the age must be more accurate , after the Swedish Migration Authority ( migration control ) had been critic@@ ised for fail@@ ures for fail@@ ures of some refugees critic@@ ised the age @-@ related age .
from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 , the migration of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now sent the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older than 18 years , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency posted that the person may probably be 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person is possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests will only be carried out in cases , in which the age of the person will be held .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are resistant to the past few months .
&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , numbers are rather constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases where the person was evaluated as more than 18 years , does not necessarily to use the asylum seek@@ ers over his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that it will give 4@@ 42 cases , the &quot; propose that the person got 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ blast over the 5@@ 81 published results , they noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that they will be 18 years old .
the method of medical age evaluation , at the x @-@ X recordings of the surve@@ yed and MRI images are analyzed , which are analyzed by t@@ ooth@@ ed and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a sk@@ ep@@ tics is the endo@@ c@@ ologist Claude Marcus of Kar@@ olin@@ ska @-@ Institut , whose work is to see the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they are earlier or later than usually through the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had any reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t believe that the type of measurement should be used .
the biological age in this way , is very un@@ certain .
if we cannot say it , we should not do so as if we could it , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
in general , Gö@@ ran@@ sson is defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of adult child is un@@ correct for adults , low in adults .
the biggest risk is in it , if the person is less under 18 , this case is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully @-@ plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ra@@ mberg .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete uses the bridge to the eastern local entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very well in the time , it runs great , &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , Bau@@ Manager at the Department of road and Transport in Freiburg .
in April the work started on all three refurb@@ ishment groups between Sch@@ ra@@ mberg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach between Sch@@ ra@@ mberg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building site is planned for October and is sure that the schedule is expected to keep on schedule .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , leads via the Tro@@ mbach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ be@@ bo@@ gen@@ bridge from concrete , filled with a red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
as the two other bridges , she has now come to the years .
in order to ensure the stability and transport security , the three Bau@@ werke will now be thorough refurb@@ ished .
the two other bridges are lead to Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were constructed in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 m long .
the bridge at the entrance to Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now Wednesday at the north side of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on the north side , and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called Brü@@ ck@@ enk@@ appe at the north side of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
this is a reinforced version that is used as an operating system .
on the southern part of the bridge the bridge is to be used on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meters width .
it should go to the pedestrian walk@@ way .
it is the particular note that this is a patent in the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge steps .
the special fing@@ er@@ ous feeling has the delay of lines by the structure in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre optic cable , which are connected to many companies .
the inhabitants have been informed of the projects in advance by hand@@ pieces on the project .
in addition , at first , they had to feed fish and cancer .
the traffic in the direction of Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , the traffic in the direction of Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , is regulated by a traffic lights .
for building work on the bridge of the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance is the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; tann@@ ins &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; in the area of the bridge .
the costs for the three br@@ ushes are amount to 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ lower in protest at German potato sal@@ ate
yes , it is not so common that parties go to a beach , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , along with what else is hard to bring a hat .
the Parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Grü@@ ne , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows that this day peaceful flag shows because the Af@@ ro in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell was inviting for a &quot; great election campaign . &quot;
and well known names on the start - how Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land is the top duo for the Bundestag on September 24 , and the deputy chairman Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ ch .

the motto &quot; The Eifel remains b@@ unt . &quot;
originally the city &apos;s picnic by the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now on the parking below the ride - and so directly before the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers since .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum A world and one of the most influential organizers , right : &quot; great , as many people have come here . &quot;
there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; ur@@ gical potato sal@@ at which could eat the Af@@ D problem , &quot; says the woman who brought him to him .
the police has many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein . it is also an presence in particular also at the railway station that is just a few meters away from the event .
how is the Af@@ D actually on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D vol@@ ei@@ fel reports that he has been involved in such an event and get the listeners .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had initially asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a say , because because of the built @-@ built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ Church did not exist enough parking .
so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes are pleased to announce that &quot; we can have a nice event here . &quot;
with view to the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right to the people , the point of peace , it remains peaceful . &quot;
that does it also : at 20 o &apos;clock , there is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle , several speakers , including the Rhine @-@ Pf@@ äl@@ z@@ an Af@@ D @-@ President Uwe Young .
in the hall there are about 200 listeners that are waiting for the federal candidate for the federal election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chairman Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ ch .
unchanged is the police reasons , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than one hour , the Af@@ D event , guests have an extended time , but there is also a long time shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can &apos;t cover any special events - no special events .

that &apos;s really injured .

I felt really attacked , sh@@ attered and damaged .

the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as a manifest compensation to Russia from Russia to an dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he won &apos;t be the moment for the country , again to the sport .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the European Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the Association of its country has been correct , and that he is determined to combat the dop@@ ing .
he said that he told him ! &quot; all athletes , in which gold and silver medals were s@@ worn away . &quot;
in spite of his comments on the IA@@ AF Congress in November 2015 , following a report in the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) reports on state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ president Co@@ e the Rep@@ or@@ ters .
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation lies in itself , that they have experienced some pretty hot times , and everything has to do anything to ensure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia is the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constru@@ ctive one , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this was not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
the principle of principle always was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes of the di@@ ced system , &quot; added :
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will start with the athle@@ tics World championships in London , which will begin to compete in London in London , after the strict IA@@ AF criteria .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must fulfil some of the criteria for recovery setting .

my Danish was pregnant , I love wine instead of beer , silk st@@ ings instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis , football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ dg@@ ings , which I was in place of Virginia @-@ Tab@@ ak and that in this country had to be the reputation of socio @-@ critical intellectuals , I was not able to hope to hope .

I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to foam .

thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ day , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the ratio was vice vers@@ a .
the new country day will be elected regular in the 14th of January .
Th@@ ü@@ mler , the red @-@ green state government must opt for if it could be in this situation without a majority .
Stephan W@@ eil , however , is essential for essential that the country day decides to bring up its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on Tuesday over her further action .
the Landes@@ jus@@ tification also sees the possibility that the country &apos;s country &apos;s Prime Minister , draws on trust and a successor .
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
these possibilities must be legally checked , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ mler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will discuss all questions , if they are legally binding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ mler was called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but something cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the politi@@ cian even emphas@@ ised : &quot; I am not a judge .
I feel very good . &quot;

the leader of the Green An@@ ja Pi@@ el said , &quot; we regre@@ ts the decision of El@@ ke Twe@@ sten . &quot;
you have decided not aware of the faction in the Group .
&quot; even before the background , there were no thematic differences , we can &apos;t move this step . &quot;
in Martin Schulz , the SPD Executive Officer Martin Schulz was sentenced to CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal of the Lower Saxony @-@ ME@@ Ps El@@ ke Twe@@ sten .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green ME@@ Ps in Lower Saxony is not only a betra@@ yal of the vot@@ ers and elect@@ ors , but also betra@@ yal in red @-@ green , &quot; the Federal Chancellor of the Social Democrats &quot; wrote on Friday .
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) to take on the land day quickly .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony , the majority .
the political historian , &quot; in her ver@@ last E@@ it@@ el@@ ness and in her Fr@@ ust , her personal interests in front of the country &apos;s welfare , &quot; critic@@ ised the SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation .

department of Agriculture in the interview - How protect us , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discussed about infected eggs .
how could happen to pass the sc@@ andal ?
how can protect consumers .
agriculture minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the editors network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and Rep@@ ly .
Mr. Schmidt , How can protect consumers in front of the po@@ ison eggs ?
I only want to encourage you to check the eggs in your fridge and check the eggs in your refrigerator .
for the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery store n@@ ung@@ .de represent the states each of the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ Char@@ gen .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even though , if we currently know , a health haz@@ ards is virtually impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best @-@ possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ conn@@ aissance minister of the Federal Minister is not really perceived ?
the food monitoring is the task of the provinces .
however , my home immediately stopped immediately and has since announ@@ cing the news in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
the trade is the same as the manufacturer to worry , that the sold @-@ sold products are competitive and health .
when eggs of the back heat level of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not easy @-@ to @-@ operate .
however , un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time not the companies school .
are sitting production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
after the present knowledge of the knowledge , the production company meets no immediate effect .
rather , they must be reck@@ oned due to mut@@ ually illegal practices of service companies with economic damage .
as always there is a little conc@@ ert@@ ure in the harvest .
is missing only at the staff or not taking part in the cr@@ us@@ her@@ eby ?
there were just the official controls who have uncovered the process .
however , to the truth , however , food was not enough to be excluded at 100 percent .
therefore , a consistent information of these events and the hand@@ over to the law firms in the cases which can be achieved by a crucial importance .
I have already been clearly made in several times that I expect from the responsible authorities .
is the regular Alar@@ mis@@ m at food sk@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumer products and consumers have the right to get safe and easy @-@ to @-@ use food .
if a non @-@ yellow insec@@ ti@@ cide in the food industry is used , consumer products are disturbed and consumer .
due to the ge@@ aring materials are manufacturers , dealers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
generally , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cian Fi@@ pr@@ oni@@ l is not acceptable with the attitude of life @-@ out animals and must be stopped immediately .
it must be consistently developed and worked with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts and l@@ enti@@ t@@ less was clari@@ fied .
how the finance rules of the foot to Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris .
the rules aimed at inter@@ mitt@@ ent , non @-@ deci@@ ding issues of the European football are to prevent the Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences are coming to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA , because the management organization that the European game has the power to provide access to the most prestigious Champions League Cup tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play Rules , which were launched in 2011 by the UEFA in 2011 , that PS@@ G has been in fact that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without large losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian army from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can make your money , so Ne@@ ym@@ ar is under@@ writing and put it into a Gal@@ ax@@ ie other stars , given the financing of the teams through the energy @-@ rich ruler of Qatar .
you are allowed to purchase a lot of money in order to purchase a lot of money , but have to control them with alloy inser@@ ts , which enable them to make the Bre@@ ak @-@ even point in their football field .
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that one that had enormous debt after the success of its success , was effectively b@@ ating , effectively frau@@ dul@@ ently and ris@@ ki@@ cked out , when banks or owners moved their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from the concentration on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally bought a club with potential and then invested in 2003 to improve the team and establish a global brand - to an tough@@ est matter .
during the current three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P programme , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in height of 30 million euros .
and even though Plat@@ ini is fallen by the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade in 2015 , its UEFA successor is Aleks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to shake off an excessive output .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will enhance the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the FF@@ P , opposite the Associ@@ ated Press in the last week .
although the PS@@ G &apos;s buy @-@ out cl@@ au@@ sel paid by Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a bit rate , you can distribute the amount for the accounting for the duration of his contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five year contract , so the resolution can be issued for the next five years at a height of 4@@ 4.4 million euros .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is located in the possession of Manchester City with the heavy sanctions .
PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time of 82 million dollars ) , and it was arranged to be reduced to 20 million euros in the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season on 21 players instead of usual 25 players .
the UEFA ist on the search for clubs , try to give up their financial overview , by making their revenues by companies that are connected with owners of a clubs .
while a cat@@ fish company the PS@@ G could be sponsor , if the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ings should exceed standard market rates , the UEFA would not be used as a legitimate income .
it happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ings of the PSA of Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar has taken over payments of the Organ@@ i@@ zing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 announced that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World ambassador will be held and a strong man@@ oeuvre for the UEFA regulatory authorities just find out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA still takes place , every attempt to observe the rules .
the UEFA had no pre @-@ prepared talks with PS@@ G on Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s transfer , sag@@ a on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of An@@ onymous with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not fu@@ ged to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 is achieved with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
PS@@ G expected that Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s will be a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing @-@ De@@ als , Mer@@ chan@@ dising and Tri@@ cot .
the association goes out that the turnover after the signature is at least 30 percent .
the Spanish league was clear , one of the best football players to see it , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s road to prevent them that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P injury .
it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in terms of official owners association PS@@ G .
Arsenal , ar@@ sen@@ al manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , will join the support of La Liga against a state that has been financed by the association .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has changed the entire landscape of the foot in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it will be difficult to respect to finance Fair@@ play , because one can have different ways or different interests if a country has a so big actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new Scho@@ g@@ gi@@ supplier
in the past years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board has been made on board chocolate for the Swiss .
now , the long @-@ term cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline writes the airline to order the contract .
Swiss @-@ spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ cy confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA a corresponding report by the newspaper &quot; Nordwest@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday .
according to recent planning the Air@@ line will take a new contract for the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and check quality control .
&quot; with the current vendor of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the spokesperson .
around 17 million small red @-@ white packing of Scho@@ gg@@ it@@ af@@ eln is up to 14 grams per year before landing at the landing of the landing .
the Swiss costs does not want to do with the costs .
industry insi@@ der estimate the order volume according to &quot; northwest Switzerland &quot; between 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the mi@@ ros subsidiary achieves annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs .
however , it is important to be the advertising effect : for a Scho@@ g@@ gi@@ sts it is a prestigious order process .
as many applic@@ ants it is in the new tender , the Swiss will not match Swiss .
in question , there are only Swiss manufacturers .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to upgrade to a renewal of the Treaty establishing the spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer does not be reached for a statement .
chocolate plates has spread the Swiss since 2006 on board of their flights .
before Swiss Life &apos;s contract signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has been delivered in cooperation with Hu@@ g the chocolate @-@ tablets .
the possibility to place the logo , led Swiss was two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate manufacturers .
on long @-@ distance excursions , customers of the First Class with treats from the Con@@ feder@@ erie Sp@@ rün@@ gli , are spo@@ iled in the business class n@@ able passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i of Lin@@ dt and in Economy class Scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .

No@@ stal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; in N@@ et Hot American Summer &quot;
this recovery of the story is the story of the 80 @-@ year @-@ old Gr@@ unge @-@ era ( as the Vor@@ den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ age ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to larger things .
as a cultural @-@ cultural era , it is equal to Par@@ o@@ die and a Em@@ bodied by our Facebook @-@ able era .
but as a Franchise feel it feels just below .
&quot; First Day of Camp &quot; function surprisingly well , not just because of his name ( it contained a original history for a pleasant dam@@ aging vegetables , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by putting it on the core of the alley - actors in medium @-@ age , playing children who are to grow , they are still the impossible to win the last part of the weather .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotional and his par@@ o@@ die goes on to the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ year @-@ old like &quot; The Hand of Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The hand made the cra@@ dle ) . &quot;
at a point , a character through an Apple @-@ Power@@ Book , some Inline Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the loving Coop ( Mr. Show@@ age ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) still not forgotten .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost its young to be lost and not lost .
and there is another crazy p@@ lot , which Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Show@@ age ) is involved in Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Show@@ age ) , which is now supported by George W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the benefits of the best part of the Franchise .
it makes it particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ avi@@ lions of sub@@ li@@ pp@@ art from &quot; Sing@@ les &quot; whose former big @-@ man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy in@@ acker .
it can be the moments that this Franchise Pictures could take part in this Franchise Pictures : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene is the band to visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; at the time .
meanwhile , &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon reminds of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The tom@@ bst@@ ones , &quot; the movie &quot; A@@ to@@ mic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even at &quot; G@@ low &quot; with his East @-@ towards @-@ West Ring @-@ I@@ con@@ ography .
the comedy has created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka to his : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , A@@ the@@ ism and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main checks - a hard but@@ er Gregor and a ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alo@@ gues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a leading producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be syn@@ ced to English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than a idea .
there is a few beautiful day to watch out ( the police have to watch out chess in television , as well as Americans do so with football ) .
and the list of the famous speaker - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ y Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a unique game &apos; fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is responsible for the tru@@ thful of a desper@@ ate propaganda threat - a mur@@ derer , who is a Reagan mask , is - that it is often playing a single one .
with six long episodes , there is then , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; based on a lower length of length could deliver better , because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef could still go back the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men , which uses a bunch of Hamburg .
the embassy for the imag@@ ined communist audience that the Western culture can do everything for a man .
the fic@@ tive Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we do it even with our own younger history and the ih@@ door .
impact against drugs @-@ m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects , such as the State Prosec@@ ution concluded on Friday .
in the age between 25 years and 77 he was arrested and detained for arrest warran@@ ts against this en@@ umer@@ ation .
in addition , the officials ordered larger quantities of mari@@ juana and co@@ ca@@ ine , Sch@@ uss@@ ons , as well as several hundreds of thousands of Euro .
at the same Raz@@ cia in Italy , two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
therefore , the two are believed to be shipped to Germany .
the action was involved in the Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were used .
the members of the Maf@@ ia organised drug criminal , severe violence , forced murder as well as Rau@@ b and Er@@ press@@ ation .
as early as the summer of 2016 , the State Prosec@@ ution appe@@ aled against the organised drug trading in Southern Germany since summer 2016 .
between the national law firms in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo a re@@ ger exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the large @-@ use on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the visions of the investigations back in particular , Italian nationals with respect to Italian m@@ af@@ ia .
a incident on May 27 in the hill in the morning , too , at the morning , several shots in a guest house is likely to go to the account of Ban@@ de .
in way , huge L@@ aps compl@@ ains in the fore@@ igner register
&quot; data of citizens who should not arise in . &quot; : a report , the foreigners register in Germany showed substantial defects in Germany .
the lead to some serious abnorm@@ alities on asylum procedures .
the Federal Government for refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has made a media report according to a media report in the country @-@ country register .
Män@@ gel near the registered data could lead to asylum seek@@ ers and abor@@ tions &quot; to some serious abnorm@@ alities , &quot; warned in an analysis that lies in the South German newspaper . &quot;
according to the register , according to the data , ten million people have recorded with foreign nationality , including about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is managed by about 600 out@@ country authorities in Germany .
because the data had not yet been kept in parts , the data quality is not well prepared in parts .
in individual cases the data of 1921 have been found , &quot; by humans , who has long been no longer in life , or by citizens that have become German citizens and in which the properties should not arise anymore . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data inser@@ ts can significantly slow , &quot; means it continues to continue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics of the disabled people there are members of the EU citizens , which are not allowed to travel to the statistics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wrong &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the debate on the approach with expres@@ sions , &quot; says it is therefore in analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the German government began to return refugee families with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children back to Italy when they travelled from there .
the go from an internal paper by the Federal Ministry for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; New Year &apos;s newspaper . &quot;
in the paper , it is that B@@ AM@@ F is taking into such a process for families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper among reference to the difficult situation in place .
after the Dublin Agreement , the EU @-@ state is responsible for refugees at first .
if a migration policy will continue to travel into another EU country , this state may send him to the check .
the office is now : &quot; now the acceptance capacity for families with min@@ der@@ age children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot;
Italy wrote for the recording and accommodation of families guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( PO@@ MR ) hold this commit@@ ments for sufficient .
other EU countries would be returned to the Dublin agreement in the framework of the Dublin agreement .
the cultural policy of the Lin@@ ks@@ fra@@ ction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children suffer from lack of illegal conditions in the Italian asylum system , and a haz@@ ards of the cinema . &quot;

but they sign@@ alized that over the next few years of interest would be necessary to cut by the Bre@@ x@@ ite inflation and they said that the credit costs may have to increase more than expected to the financial markets .
the members also voted for this , part of the Mam@@ mut business cycle packages , which was issued before a year after Bre@@ x@@ ite .
it will be spending time for financial aid plans to provide banks with funding for banks , although they said that they will cost 15 billion pounds more than this system at this system will be available - with 115 billions of pounds ster@@ ling .
after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central prog@@ nosis of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product will be weak , since the print will continue to use the consumption for consumption . &quot;
at the interest rates , she repeated that &quot; a certain amount of money policy &quot; to cooling the inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; extent would be required when the markets are expected .
the markets forecast the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that increases &quot; step &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the Bank lowered the growth prog@@ nosis of the Bank for this and next year , 1.9 % in May , forecast 1.9 % and 1.7 % .
she has maintained its growth prog@@ nosis of 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after this news on the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change , after the most recent dis@@ appoint@@ ing growth numbers have increased increasing expectations and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to grow in the third quarter , although it is expected to recover slightly in the Bank at the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report was given little enthusiasm for households , which is affected by a increasing level of inflation and mar@@ gin@@ ous confidence , because the disappearance is not even worse before she became aware of them .
they added that monetary policy in the next few years is not able to stop the income statement , &quot; but they added that wages for the end of its three @-@ year increase is &quot; recover . &quot;
the economy is further strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ unds , which is a part of the lower consumer expenditure .
the decision is a year after lowering the interest rates to 0,@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ ks of the pins .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years , until this will reach the prices and the economy will be complete .
before the last judgment of the Bank to interest rates , the reputation was increased after an interest rate , since inflation was increased by the pressure on hard , with three policy decision @-@ makers in July an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation is reduced to 2.6 % last month in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected to return in the coming months .
the Bank said that over@@ flow the relationship with their goal of 2 % is &quot; quite &quot; to the weak Po@@ unds .
Andrew Mont@@ t , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ ar Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the shorter return of the s@@ wap rates , mort@@ gage market should be more competitive , since its lending is strongly looking for shops and the year in positive way .
the market looks very well suited for those who do the existing De@@ als and the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) was alleged to con@@ genital HIV @-@ dro@@ ge 10,000 people .
patients will receive access to a &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; HIV @-@ pre@@ operative treatment in September after a battle against the High Court in N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that before sexual inter@@ course , pre@@ valence sp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the infection risk by around 86 percent , now being delivered by health service over a first three @-@ year study for 10,000 people .
he declared himself to finance the trial , after the App@@ eal chamber confirmed the judgment to the Supreme Court in the last year that the N@@ HS had predicted to pay for the Pr@@ EP in spite of the asser@@ tion that the local authorities were able to finance him .
the Thursday announced that chess train was announced by N@@ HS England @-@ Chief Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; while the National Ai@@ ds Trust ( NAT ) announced it as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool , and She@@ ff@@ ield will follow the registration of people , and others will follow in October , before it will be launched in England in April 2018 .
pre@@ valence sp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medications which are taken before the sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP reduces the HIV @-@ transmission at infection .
Pr@@ EP before sexual inter@@ course means that just enough drugs in the body have been present in order to prevent HIV infection .
such medication can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual inter@@ course .
to one person who come for the treatment in question , pregnant or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not successfully treated with HIV @-@ positive partners .
in clinics , suitable participants were identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner , whose HIV @-@ status is not known due to anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a doctor , can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of medicine in this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study is to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP , by combining clinical trials , as it is used in a large scale , recorded and implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts for the prevention of HIV .
there is another milestone in the more than three decades , one of the greatest health challenges of mankind . &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Ai@@ ds Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , when it is targeted to needs and endangered people , offers the ability to modify the English HIV @-@ epide@@ mic .
of September to people with high HIV @-@ risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England in order to develop a new instrument that is actually subject to a partner , which is subject to improve many , many life .
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be carried out throughout the country , and that no one who has left the risk of HIV .
now , since the Pr@@ EP test medicine was abol@@ ished , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ positive people . &quot;
Sharon Br@@ her@@ son , shadow of Health , said : &quot; the start of the Pr@@ EP trial is after months of late and re@@ build the government through the government and over@@ due to the government .
the evidence shows how trans@@ form@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV @-@ prevent and transfer the transfer of these life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is so fast as possible in the country to protect persons who are HIV infected in the country , and that it will be able to contribute to the termin@@ ation of dissem@@ ination of HIV in society .
the great life live : mezzanine and smart designers and tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court in a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced by a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof for the new design that Jo@@ anne is not packed and sold their bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I sought after something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
me have made me in love and made a bid for this day . &quot;
since the first viewing the 1,000 square foot of the apartment was completely over@@ taken .
originally a one @-@ room estate with a bol@@ ted layout , it had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne reservoir , and a mezzanine add to use the generous cover height .
&quot; I wanted to high ceilings , great windows , plenty of light .
this was my request , &quot; she says .
to this purpose , they commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; S@@ HE@@ D by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was a 12.5 ft high ceilings and home to a home that was not only a development but also a place for jo@@ anne .
the blanket was not big enough to place two rooms over@@ place , so the architectural challenge was in it to create a mezzanine which you stand .
Er@@ fan had to think about it to solve the application .
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; says .
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so could arrange that they were aston@@ ished in each other , without that we had to decor@@ ate us .
it &apos;s not only to build a simple platform to build a simple platform , but the steel so that he had the right height or below the right height . &quot;
this arrangement enabled it to place it Er@@ fan , two rooms at full height and place - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us is looking down to the gl@@ am@@ ous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting is set to set the style for the program .
the use of Spi@@ ke plays a role in the hin@@ ts of theatre , space and light .
the ends of the ends is a short corridor to leave him longer .
in the kitchen it feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red room for all the best corner and glasses of jo@@ anne .
thanks to the perception of a gl@@ am@@ our@@ y room , the beauty of living room can be used to do the kitchen , if it is not used .
fully equipped kitchens are nothing new .
the special to this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went there , &quot; says Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , fur@@ ni@@ ated MDF @-@ door .
it is important to consider so that , when you move the door to move , very easily g@@ assed . &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage room , jo@@ anne includes an additional 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and an upgraded layout .
&quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the basic area - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate in@@ kler and a calculation of based on the soil size . &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and to use high @-@ quality materials , which have advantage of the space advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things that lets you touch and therefore help to create an emotional binding in an home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t get you into the electrical outlets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your hearts . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be found through a good design and increased square met@@ er@@ ation of a bit standard in a little bit .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not .
brothers are strug@@ gling for a $ 500 million real estate agency .
two brothers have four decades after their Italian family founded the Dyn@@ asty , in a confron@@ tation due to one of the largest real estate leaders in Vict@@ ori@@ as in a value of more than 500 million dollars .
the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has led him to clari@@ fy him to clari@@ fy its property and business .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over the separation will take place in the Supreme Court of Justice .
together with her mother Anna , the brethren of 38 properties found in the value of more than half a billion dollars , and since then the family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co Je@@ ans family established and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis , now includes offices in the city rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler and shopping centres in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her deceased father , Colin - von Paul as &quot; principal operators and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s electricity and Paul about one third .
in fact that this means that Colin has owned by USD 316 million in the value of 176 million dollars in the value of 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has been proved for Paul as a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by Colin proposed by Colin proposed to leave him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first affair in the first affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed intermedi@@ aries took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court .
the brothers are now fighting for control over the existing shop - of which Colin made it impossible .
Colin argued , this is not true , but takes Paul prior to manage some owners in@@ competent .
in an early affair known of Aff@@ i@@ da@@ vit , which was submitted by Colin , he says , he hope to raise the war .
&quot; my Italian heritage is writing that the family is the main priority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost will rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and Charter from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners , and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides held by law firms .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her died @-@ husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the dairy farmers and commercial shops in the late 1950 &quot; s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
you use the safety to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Colin made the first je@@ ans@@ wering of the family .
Colin said he was West@@ co there , when he was &quot; over my last years the high school , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she died and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property in her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi said to me that he never wanted to walk that the brothers &quot; brothers &quot; wrote &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are not more part of the De Lu@@ tis group , with Colin claimed that Mark was paid for the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
both Luke is also Mark , and Paul , says Paul , &quot; says Paul , on the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin made a very return , although he was a former AF@@ L executive board , and after a biography from the year 2015 , Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took their contact with Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Colin responded by SMS to say , &quot; I can really say much , &quot; because the case before the dishes .
it is very sad , it &apos;s very sad , my brother Paul decided to for@@ erunner me , and our family name through the courts &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Colin made a letter to the court that he had tried to meet the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Father would not forget that Paul and I would be in our current struggle , &quot; he said , &quot; he added that he is still a solution . &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our affair is solved in the near future of the dishes , &quot; wrote Colin .
Tr@@ um@@ ps new Chief of Staff plans to submit the media trip to the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly is actually doing .
if yes , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow on President tr@@ ump , including the reports of the news media - in hope to hold the boss on a equivalent course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; as John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , in his first working day with executive officers , he set up a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he rep@@ airing : bad information that took place in the hands of the President .
Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow , whether on paper or in letter , because the president would make better decisions , if he would be good information . &quot;
wa@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others tried to sign an dump and monitor his media management .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship is sufficient for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , he is still heavily damaged in the White House .
&quot; if the candidate Tr@@ ump was de@@ filed , it was productive to show him that he was able to convince him a f@@ aire reporting of places , who were to convince him , &quot; said the former election campaign Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to Poli@@ tico .
Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key , tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter change will be under control , according to six former elect@@ oral @-@ officials to ensure that his personal media con@@ figure includes a good lob@@ b@@ able prize . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that &quot; tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter @-@ habits is ever &quot; under control , &quot; is ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
perhaps these Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ beam@@ ers something that we do not know what we do not know that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets contain without their interventions , even more det@@ ects .
we will probably experience something about the twe@@ ets that have not broadcast the lac@@ ed .
if his co@@ workers took it already some times a number of times , sle@@ w from him , then their efforts was worth it .
but no one has to prevent it out that lac@@ tic control causes .
a part of the problem is that people in a White House that brought out from competing parties , will always try to introduce their own agenda by adding tr@@ ump material , which promotes their beli@@ efs of the world .
Poli@@ tico - quite with this story - reported in May about the preliminary adviser to the coun@@ s@@ ellor , President of Strate@@ gic and strategic reasons .
this was an example , described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react rapidly to negative press lines , especially those with damaged Lec@@ ks , and that it takes you out to find out what these originate .
exactly what happened at the end of February when someone said to be a printed copy of an article by Got@@ .com , the website of the Internet @-@ pro@@ voc@@ ateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy commander in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap of Lec@@ ks &quot; at the White House .
although Johnson had been banned from Twitter on Twitter or that he has not offered a concrete evidence or that he had false alle@@ g@@ ations in the past .
Tr@@ ent read the article and began to ask employees over Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ maker added to , that the then @-@ Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us , and Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage the papers and document the paper . &quot;
how did the fol@@ t ?
Kelly tried three months later , the same thing .
perhaps he may prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still His impul@@ sing self , and his advis@@ ing is still on the impact .
these un@@ altered factors make cell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .

from Bir@@ k@@ enhof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof was lost by the then ambi@@ ence business company mbH to 13 April 2014 at about 30 000 nights per year and proceeds through the tourist tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of the increasing numbers of refugees , which came to the County , the hotel building was offered as omni@@ directional accommodation , which caused a controversial discussions .
the city prevented the lodging of asylum seek@@ ers in order to secure the area of a construction , to secure the area as a hotel site .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at the time .
but the birth@@ place of Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel site in front of the hotel location , and said that time from serious growing interested in the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ und with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer , headquartered in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object four houses .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during a long period of time , and when you arrive at the entrance , a lot of renovation work will be carried out .
the floors were destroyed , ceilings to part of disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still a lot to do .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk@@ able showers , the input area is designed , new window will be installed .
everything that is &quot; nice bourgeois close , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a gem piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , spa areas and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
it is not at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad positioning , but already on a high city level , emphas@@ ises Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise &apos;s Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its about 60 rooms will become wide , explains sc@@ erer continued .
individual holiday@@ makers , groups or business meetings should feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Krau@@ se he had already led , so sh@@ aver .
the performances of the city are covered with those of the hotel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are on the same line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants to move exactly .
almost under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the external equipment will also be brought to the fore@@ man , that is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace which is open from the restaurant , the public is open to be accessible .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : US Special Sch@@ mitt@@ ler sets a Grand Jury
in the Russia @-@ affair , US President Donald Tr@@ ump is supposed to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury in Robert Mu@@ eller after a report .
in recent weeks the panel I recorded work in the past weeks , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote under calling on one thing of confi@@ dential persons .
the paper evalu@@ ates the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller its investig@@ ates and intensi@@ fied its investigation .
the transmitter CNN reported it is the first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us secret services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin since longer , targeted to the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examines whether it was conducted between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign and Moscow .
the investigations into a focus of investigations should be several men who acted in the elect@@ oral campaign as a consultant of the Repub@@ lic@@ ers .
according to report , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the magni@@ fying .
the &quot; Washington Post , &quot; wrote some weeks ago that the Special Sch@@ ol@@ ler Tr@@ ump personally presented himself in the center , and let down whether the president in the wake of the affair possibly the justice .
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is it to examine , present in possible failure , and decide whether the indictment should be collected .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore called the anchor chambers .
mostly , it is switched on when larger and controversial cases .
the procedure will always be carried out behind closed doors .
the panel can also be switched from the public prosecutor to invite people to the presence of Ei@@ d .
according to the transmitter , there were already pre @-@ inv@@ itations that rot@@ ate the meeting between Donald Tr@@ um@@ J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons that were involved in the meeting were asked to be called to a statement , called the name of it in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
besides Tr@@ um@@ J@@ r. were also Tr@@ um@@ ps advisor and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his dam@@ aging election campaign Paul Man@@ af@@ ort at the conversation .
right @-@ wing experts said on Thursday evening on Thursday evening in the US television that the study showing that Mu@@ eller takes place in his work not bays , and that he should be necessary to act as soon as soon .
however , it does not inevit@@ ably indicate that the Grand Jury on the end is switched to decide on a charge of an indictment .
nevertheless , the inauguration of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the owner of President Tr@@ ump .
in the middle of the new revel@@ ations took the President on Thursday evening a speech in West Virginia to depic@@ t Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme give the Demok@@ rates a way to feel &quot; good to feel &quot; because they can &apos;t have anything else that they may talk about it . &quot;
his special adviser T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in a statement that he could not know nothing from the jury of a Grand Jury .
this work , however , I am also common in the housing , he stressed .
the White House acqu@@ itted any measures , which accelerated the work of the special intermedi@@ ary on &quot; f@@ aire &quot; way .
the former FBI leader James Com@@ ey had told three times that I will not be determined against the President .
we have no reason to assume that something has changed , the name of it was in the statement .
however , Mu@@ eller was not used , after Tr@@ ump @-@ Com@@ ey had been limited .
because of this ra@@ mp , the accus@@ ations have gone against Tr@@ ent , he used the justice .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , I was asked for a setting of investigation against the former security adviser Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president stands for an investigation under large pressure .
according to the presentation of US media , the White House collected the White House against the Sonder@@ kommand@@ o and his employees .
it dis@@ b@@ anded the spectacle , whether tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller will be released .
in other than an independent special stage of con@@ gresses , such as the President Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller has abandoned his role in the Water@@ gate affair , expressed his role in theory of the President of the Department of Justice in theory .
several channels of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republican and democratic channels put on Thursday the law@@ suit , after which the special statements could not be released any more .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : the gigantic Eis@@ berg Mountain in the Antar@@ ctic
in the western Antar@@ c@@ tica , a giant Eis@@ berg has fallen from the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from Sch@@ el@@ ap@@ s .
the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut für Polar@@ oid and Maritime Research will be informed of the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institute for Polar and Maritime Research on Wednesday .
more than a Bil@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres was driving big coloni@@ sts well after the north and will probably need two , three years until he was mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , the researchers have been registered in the past three decades .
a danger for people goes from him from him .
in@@ ert , climate change played a role in the demo@@ li@@ tion of the Eis@@ ber@@ ges , is un@@ clear according to research data .
in total , there has been a series of unusual con@@ vents for around 30 years in the region , writes the US research centre for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a facsimile ground .
according to many researchers , he could hang up with the global warming .
the now broken Kol@@ oss until now a part of Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ &apos;s Day .
Sch@@ el@@ &apos;s flo@@ ats on the sea and is locked by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow further into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ z is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
north of this sn@@ ail was the balance of wax and break off some years ago .
a complete sc@@ el@@ iness was to fall there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there will be a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C sc@@ el@@ iness are in danger , because the front edges had never moved so far as far as at present .
in addition , the ice plate can be cut under the voltage and could be broken if there would like to inter@@ rupt a piece a piece .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ ap@@ s and Eis@@ berg increased the sea level , because they swim on the water and ice cream as much water , as it is after the melting it himself .
however , the loss of the weakness is that the glacier directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , however , only in small size , the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ is is the fourth largest of Antar@@ c@@ tica to A@@ WI , with almost 50 000 square kilometers .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick , on the front side to the open ocean about 200 meters .
it breaks regularly .
&quot; although there is a natural beauty and we have no direct connection to climate change , the ic@@ les is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y by the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; this is the most extensive withdrawal since the beginning of the recordings , &quot; confirmed .
under scientists be cont@@ ested whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ eon will go back or long @-@ term , and might be combined with : &quot; our models will say that there will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last for decades .
even if this researchers found the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg on climate change , so many sco@@ op@@ ts of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula are fall into the past few decades .
the Antar@@ c@@ tica lies in the direction of South America .
according to data of the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice area of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have gone up 28 000 square kilometers over the 1950s .
this was contributed to the decline of temperature .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have killed around three degrees in the past 50 years , thereby making the areas where the temperature was fastest on the fastest @-@ growing .
CD@@ U wants to staff the staff at staff
because it is more difficult to occupy free spots , the CD@@ U calls for the CD@@ U from the employers &quot; association to be more attractive .
just before the summer break , the last day has made 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants are working for the county management in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now , 17 trainees were behind her first working day behind .
the apprenti@@ ces in circle are obviously very popular .
approximately 620 applications were used for this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to staff , to tackle the growing demands and tasks can be overcome .
at the moment , there are at district M@@ ett@@ mann circle like 50 not occupied places .
these include doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration , among other things , physicians , engineers and the forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U would like to take the initiative and take the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG &apos;s initiative and expert presentations in the administration .
after the request of parties , &quot; a concept for recru@@ iting and recru@@ iting works &quot; will work in accordance with the request of parties . &quot;
the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term needs of skilled workers , but future oriented of the applic@@ ants of the candidates .
the overall concept was to implement the inside and outside , effective measures for cross @-@ step boards , and a train@@ ee offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds as a good approach to a good approach .
for the circle has to do with staff problems , the man had not knew earlier .
other cities spread good civil servants and employees , and offer more attractive conditions .
the address is from a real &quot; competition for the public employers . &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees working for disease or age due to age from service .
so the best time to do so , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
however , Klaus @-@ Dieter st , leader of the CD@@ U , continues to be re@@ acting on the joint request by his party .
he did his long @-@ day surprise for a f@@ au@@ st@@ ula , when he sur@@ rendered a number of staff publicly in question , and the remaining parties were astonishing .
people want to be checked , that all the possibilities must be checked out of the municipal employers .
&quot; if we do not come to a temporary solution , the circle administration should be covered with trade unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the circular cities - a low @-@ rate control . &quot;
thus the CD@@ U tried to pay the CD@@ U , the employees and officials to pay for the opening of the opening service .
the sal@@ aries are currently prescribed , enhancement or more money is only if you are in a higher level that changes to professional years .
however , the tasks of the cre@@ ises are more grown in the past years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up , in which employees were to take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ gress Protection Act .
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have not too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tened the sound to NGOs @-@ migrants
Italy , NGOs , the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that it was not allowed to continue to hold a new rules for operations .
&quot; if NGOs did not write a new code of conduct , it &apos;s difficult to see how they can continue work , &quot; said Interior Marco M@@ inn@@ iti , in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came to one day after the Italian authorities have had a boat of the German aid organization &apos; youth rescue by the Italian authorities , because their team had worked in a manner in a manner that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which is only been operating in operation since a year , it is expected to sell on exec@@ uting the Italian national wal@@ ker Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o .
the salvation of the human life is our top priority . so we are sorry that we can not work in search and rescue operation , &quot; said the organisation in a statement on social media .
&quot; we can also be collected all of the accus@@ ations which are not collected , however , after we have gathered all information and the situation . &quot;
the Italian authorities had monitored the boat of &apos; youth ba@@ il@@ out &apos; , the Iu@@ v@@ a , has been monitored since October .
it is alleged that his crew are to be delivered on board , that they can be delivered directly by Menshevi@@ ks , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can be used again , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one of such a group re@@ union allegedly took place just 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the Prosecutor of the State , whose content was published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected of having suspected of taking over the authority of Italian coast@@ guards , rescue workers in the zone of humanitarian reasons , and not from any other mo@@ tives .
under the code of Con@@ duct , boats like the Iu@@ v@@ a must have a Italian police officers on board their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue operations are ready to hold on the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
last , on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ official , but acceptable , as they would not be any &quot; fundamental changes or disability &quot; of their rescue operations .
the Nobel Prize winner of the doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) is among the person who refused to sign itself .
M@@ inn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who had declined sharply in Italy in recent weeks , that efforts to strengthen the strengthening of the Libyan Coast Guard and the cooperation with local civil society .
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister .
he gave plans for further conversations with Libyan civil society in this month , with C@@ had , Niger and Mali over measures to reduce the number of migrants , which can reach these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post office &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Northern Palat@@ inate for four days and to enjoy tourist attractions .
three @-@ friendly Guides are available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the castle and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome bonus .
the first tour led to a hot summer temperatures along the vineyards on the Micha@@ el@@ eb@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
there followed a view points , partly on towers , of which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the pre @-@ bearing levels .
in between there , there were still longer asc@@ ents , for which long tri@@ als of re@@ wards .
on the second day , it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest .

console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga took place for e @-@ sport
sit the Sport @-@ stars in front of computer consoles , instead of super@@ v@@ y at wind and weather on the stadium to battle ?
factor is : e @-@ sport has long become long @-@ growing industry , leading to a lu@@ cra@@ tive business - great stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high levels .
this also recognised the first Bundes@@ lig@@ as an recognized that increasingly involved in this area .
in the beginning of July 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and the most recently in the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , which was founded in mid @-@ July , and two professionals for the computer game of FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to insp@@ ire their new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says the Executive Board of Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
he is sure , &quot; that on the train even a path asc@@ ension . &quot;
on the upcoming weekend the football World Cup FIFA in London organised the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where Gam@@ ers compete in various clubs .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven qualified .
also Robin Dut@@ t looks great potential for e @-@ sport .
the Ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen will have a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football must be in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds so that the young people continue to go into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : there were a tried to take all possible markets , in particular the Asian countries .
with most prominent e @-@ sport companies , you could be online by far more often in these markets , as only once a year , to send the Federal Republic to Asia .
what &apos;s exactly ?
at the E @-@ Sports Computer games such as &quot; League Of Le@@ gends , &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation of FIFA to competition .
long , as in normal sport also , Li@@ gen established himself , in which the professionals are competing .
and in the 2022 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but this is at all about a proper sports art ?
for many , the performance is safe .
also Ingo F@@ rob@@ ous has long dealt with the question .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is an sport , because he is a peti@@ tive and many biological and physical responses showing , for example , increased heart rates , st@@ ress@@ an@@ cies , hormon@@ al changes .
also , there are co@@ hesi@@ abilities , a technical and tac@@ tic understanding and a quick response ability .
professional gam@@ er should not only exercise on the console , but also their bodies and make their diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte players is a good player . &quot;
but also problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is always a topic : &quot; dop@@ ing is always a subject . &quot;
controls are hard through online games , and in the scene is missing the structures of classical sports .
in positive , the scientists concluded the high integ@@ rative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
players are internationally on the road that is like a great global family , since there are no inter@@ cultural diversity .
a study of the company consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 we had been implemented 50 million euros in Germany , mainly concerning advertising , Spon@@ sor@@ ing and great tournaments .
in three years the turnover is expected to be 130 million .
against the nearly 2,4 billion euros of the football @-@ Bundes@@ liga is little bit too .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is not far more far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte Advisor .
international are many countries already .
great markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ Bas@@ que Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez are participating in the US team NR@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher is investing in the e@@ Sports Series provider only .
some of these things are in Europe .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced in a Norwegian school , says F@@ rob@@ ous .
in the Netherlands and France , the football first League for the first liga season are now obliged to establish an e @-@ sport division .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ f@@ B @-@ board member Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nostal@@ gia , even if the old times are clari@@ fy , it is no longer enough .
this is why the tradition of the Association is to preserve the company at the same time on the modern market .
&quot; we live in an digi@@ tised world , &quot; says Dut@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t recall that only when football remains so , as it was always &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter van@@ ishes because of the text , he was sentenced to self @-@ suicide .
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend via texts and calls to the suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their sentence behind Git@@ tern and five years were exposed to berries .
Carter , Carter , was sentenced in June of 2014 due to a practic@@ ed murder of Conrad Roy , who took her life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is unknown to the east .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter I was allowed to appeal to appeal .
she was confronted with a maximum @-@ term of 20 years , but their legal representatives argued that both it and Mr Roy had suffered a mental illness .
in red trousers and cre@@ amy colored Bl@@ use , Carter , with tears in the eyes , with@@ drawn up in the eyes , with folded hands and down below , when she was condemned .
&quot; their actions have brought Conrad Roy , &quot; said the Prosecutor of the State Court .
&quot; she finished his life to make their own better . &quot;
she has no responsibility to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no Reu@@ ben is shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Car@@ ters , said , &quot; It is a &quot; terrible revolution , &quot; it was totally un@@ regre@@ t . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , &quot; he did not found that their &quot; age or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even their spirits have had a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
an At@@ tor@@ ney General , a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , that there is no day that I don &apos;t have the loss of my beloved son .
I would like to say that he is proud of me , and how I try with everything . I try , despite all of my pain that we will be for etern@@ ity with us , for his sisters &apos; name it is therein .
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; persecuted by the knowledge &quot; that she will never take part in the wedding day of her brother , or would be a t@@ ant for his children .
&quot; no more than this one person , with whom I was together for my birth , I was a pain that I would have kept for the rest of my life forever , &quot; she said . &quot;
the case seems to put a certain preced@@ ence because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it to be a crime against suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide in the year 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters &apos;s text revealed that she had encouraged him to finish his life .
&quot; tra@@ g you on , spring of a building , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that had sent them in two weeks before his death , while he was with his family in holiday .
in the eye on his suicide she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Conrad , &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing about what you have to do is to enter the generator and will be happy and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter have sought attention through the death of Roy , and ordered that they should benefit from any press from the case .
the case has given the legal opinion .
among the few , the Carter def@@ ends , Am@@ anda Knox , who was sentenced in 2007 for murder on her British co @-@ resident in Italy , before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published in Los Angeles Times a commentary : &quot; Michelle Carter deser@@ ves comp@@ assion and help , not in prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learn from the new Mini @-@ l@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua had to play me at the Audi Cup as the captain , it is no coincidence .
FC Bayern particip@@ ates the Con@@ tra @-@ Cup winner a big season - extra @-@ motivation since not .
something was in the cabin in the cabin , the Joshua saw me immediately , even if the additional clothing , very small was very small .
but far as far as far as wide and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , no Philipp l@@ ame and also no Manuel Neu@@ er , he made him a Bin@@ d content to the arm .
&quot; the coach has not announced , &quot; the Con@@ tra @-@ Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria @-@ Kapitän .
good if one level could have better , than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of Coach was also called for me .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was playing music from youth players , Deb@@ ge , and just from the vacation @-@ making professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a game leader , but it was chosen .
there is one of those people , to those who want to keep a lot of those who want to keep at that time .
so who , so , that an inheritance of l@@ ame was directed by l@@ ame , can only use a little extra motivation in only easy @-@ to @-@ use .
Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want to take over as a player : &quot;
at the Wednesday fl@@ itz@@ te of the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as a mini @-@ l@@ ame .
right behind , that is now his position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did her rest .
and at all , Kim@@ me take me in this starting information such as the one that can take the herds to the best in the hand .
he gave birth , he tried to drive the troops .
he had a look at the whole , while many others have been dealing with themselves .
Vi@@ dal went to play his lack of fitness ( fol@@ ly hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus look forward to the performances of the Asia @-@ trip ( also limited ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le began to fall negative in their first appearance at Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
it happens quite good .
Sü@@ le ran alongside Kim@@ dy , Ru@@ dy before the end of the gun , both acted as a sovereign state .
the nam@@ ing occupied Nap@@ oli storm , often difficult to try and tried again in the game of a few times in the game of the game .

the greatest K@@ ehr@@ t@@ wende looks like Nat@@ us in infrastructure policies : the line 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands in the pri@@ stine list of the country at the top of the country .
this year , the Ministry of Justice will still hopes to be part of a plan for up to 2021 .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ l@@ ung Trier , which stands in the pre@@ dict@@ ory demand of the country plan .
the aim is to take advantage of the circuit in December 2020 , says the Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann Group .

Audi is alleged to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - Aut@@ oh@@ er@@ ers see with a counter@@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi said that it would be able to update its software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles .
the BMW president , the company was said that &quot; it is intelligent options as driving restrictions , &quot; and thus stood on European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the companies as a call .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines used as a car@@ zin@@ ate and can cause asth@@ ma .
the cost of car manufacturers , plants for neutr@@ alisation of diesel cars , also need to install it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel will also be accused of ignore the powerful auto companies to ignore and signs of the problem .
the company try to avoid the error of Volkswagen , which regulate the use of so @-@ called off @-@ age devices , emissions regulate the regulations , if a car has been tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were indicted for Volkswagen , other are examined on both sides of the Atlan@@ ti@@ ks .
last month , the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ yn@@ amik was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected before shipping and could be charged in the United States .
in the beginning of this year , Audi were involved in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen , following the authorities of Audi acc@@ uses its system to avoid emission legislation in Europe , and an inquiry that focused on the United States .
the inclusion of Audi into the study could have a hard drive : the luxury car manufacturer carries a disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ately at the profit of Volkswagen .

in the first years as an artist , he proposed himself as a character for congratulations through - which led him fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; the happy day in my professional life was the day , when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he managed to match his breakthrough in his &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazine around the world .
in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
the artist insp@@ ire together again in the artist .
the big , famous Mor@@ di@@ llo pieces of tum@@ ul@@ ums in drawings with the steep@@ le tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , he sits on his own information , even today at the table , works almost ten hours a day .
more than Cal@@ endar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ates and watches are still a lot of spread throughout the world .
for six years he has also been working on an animation and a TV series with its figures .
the main person in the &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any test@@ es animal in his drawings - that has a thous@@ and@@ ths as counter @-@ player .
for the first time his figures in the 3D film , the 2019 is to come on the chin @-@ screen .
&quot; I don &apos;t exactly what they say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script will not be written by him .
therefore , it is more on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , wor@@ t@@ less produced .
Lav@@ en@@ del from Provence on climate change
he has become an icon of Provence in the South of France but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is a great conditions because of the d@@ rou@@ ghts in d@@ rought , and because of the diseases are transmitted , scientists and farmers are trying to find solutions to find out great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effective because the plant was exposed to the impact of climate change , which in the spring has brought much rain in the spring and much more .
this has impact on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , that transfers the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ ades , and at very dry weather there is very many of them . &quot;
and it stands much on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil lo@@ osen not only for holiday@@ makers , it is also very interested in perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long vegetable pipes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , sub@@ developed and weak@@ ened either .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
among the solutions , which are considered , however , a better water distribution and de@@ formation of ev@@ ap@@ oration of the soil , but also the result of the plants with a protective mixture of sound and water , and the development of varieties which are resistant to dr@@ yn@@ ess resistance .
the town Ge@@ isa in the th@@ ür@@ k R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1200 @-@ year existence .

the assassination of an journalists emphas@@ ises the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly magazine Ri@@ odo@@ ce meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check out their plans for coverage of reporting on the youngest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through which organized crimes , corrupt officials and un@@ aud@@ ited drug abuse .
but on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , she came together to speak about security .
it was noti@@ fied to them that it is important to change their routine .
two high @-@ level journalists will discuss what is saf@@ er : they are supposed to take their children with the office , which were in 2009 the goal of a attack with gren@@ ades , or they are at home .
security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , Verb@@ al .
they ask the re@@ porter for each column - no proof is necessary , per@@ cep@@ zing and pancre@@ as .
there are drug addi@@ g@@ gler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to have suspected of the secret of the government or the card , a catalogue of bre@@ asts , who is dangerous to chaos .
there are no ru@@ ction of violence , and throughout the country , there are more journalists : at least 25 years since then President Enri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ eto has held its office since December 2012 . 5@@ 89 stand after attacks and threats of Bundes@@ schutz und until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries .
among the latter , the publisher and its spir@@ it@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the biggest error is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his many books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
his mouth is deeply wor@@ rying , although his presence is still present - a large photo of Val@@ dez , with Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , T @-@ Shirts , who show his s@@ mil@@ ing face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and re@@ por@@ ters about their shared subjects , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , Par@@ an@@ oia .
although it was built in 2010 , a special event was established to process the cases of journalists , according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists just two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of murders , which are associated with drug trading and organized crime , are the mur@@ derer of journalists just rarely found before court .
in Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still exist that the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a are still treat , although they are still un@@ tr@@ unner and even though the terrain has now still missing .
without any information about the mort@@ ars , without righteousness , the meeting on the discussion of safety is little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very dum@@ m , my time in this workshop , &quot; says he says .
&quot; as long as we do not know the war@@ um , we see all . &quot;
on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he just managed to drive a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was removed from two men before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was removed from his car and was shot down for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - that with &quot; 12th river . &quot;
the Schütz@@ e drove in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez there are practically nothing as a silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in January and the extradition of the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the most powerful batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as ri@@ val@@ isi@@ sted cargo will fight here to fill the vacuum .
it &apos;s nothing to be shot in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day , or a number of people on the road , or that the cemetery is full of destroyed , two @-@ storey Maus@@ ol@@ een for drug abuse , which are bigger than many houses for the living life .
forget to forget that there is a state of peace , &quot; if only one cart@@ el has the control of the coastal state , with its precious ports and drugs trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work was Is@@ mail Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the guil@@ t that he could not use his friend &apos;s friend .
he believes , that two disp@@ arity to have contributed to the murder .
first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ as@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ ents of anti@@ trust in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
these publication may be the sons of Israel , the members of the issue bought each copy of the issue , as soon as they delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second mistakes was in this case , Val@@ dez did not hesitate to force after the complaint was published in the same story that the country had to leave the country to its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survived that his friends and colleagues did so long that he would always be .
he was working as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined together with five colleagues to the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US @-@ Dollar shar@@ ehol@@ dings in 2003 .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism , without on the noise ry problem , &quot; said Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
with the time the newspaper served a reputation for the mu@@ e@@ tigen and hon@@ our@@ ing reporting , and the turnover and advertising .
re@@ por@@ ters loved it , hard @-@ awaited investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication , where they could read stories that no one else has to treat .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce it received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage at the persecution of the Mexican drug history , where they always led them .
he voluntarily gave himself to he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue to live , &quot; he said to the CP@@ J award at the time of the CP@@ J award .
drug order in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento and TV .
&quot; you need to take over the task that falls as a journalist , either the or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what you have done in view of many dead ... why did you have not told what happened ? &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team is Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird who could just like a harbour workers , who was a friend , gener@@ ously with arm@@ aments and advice , a teacher who knew how to survived .
you trusted in his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
he would always sit down to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the Bar on the office , and there are always seats at the same table .
now she ask : was his love to routine use ?
his death also has forced to leave their own attack on the question about how they can do their work on the best .
&quot; you like it , if you don &apos;t like to move with their female , their children , their own home , their native home and run@@ ways , &quot; to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; says Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ makers and self @-@ maintaining .
his own Inst@@ ink@@ ers rely on .
if it is false , keep it out of it .
the trouble , said the publisher of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real , is that &quot; smell a sense that can be shared ... and then the thing is happening with J@@ avier . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and other states , are not more - as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cra@@ w@@ rou@@ ters , weak institutions and corrupt officials at home is home .
the landscape changed steadily .
in the room , where the employees met Ri@@ odo@@ ce to security training , suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days before , Spyware , who was sold exclusively to governments , is used to monitoring the monitoring of journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a building site .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce to protect the village of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a mid @-@ size range of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the sh@@ ear , some of the re@@ porter , whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who had the governor itself as a trusted rule .
it is months ago , since the re@@ porter in the mountains have gone down , where the drug con@@ vey@@ ors de facto under control .
for the issue of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce has stretched to three main stories .
there was the assassination of the brother Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an Ex@@ pos@@ é to the state expenditure , which focused on the home of the govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that led to one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the State , an ab@@ duction .
there was no official word that , who was ab@@ duc@@ ted , or as it happened , so was careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite locally of drug addi@@ ction and authorities .
a re@@ porter found out of public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled the regi@@ strations Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled the whole century all political levels .
several PR@@ I @-@ govern@@ ors were accused of corruption due to high @-@ profile cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write the inci@@ dents in this location , among them a son of &quot; El Ch@@ ak@@ apo &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man , a military attack .
just a few months before@@ hand the readers &quot; column by Val@@ dez , considered the best informed source on the ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with nick@@ name &quot; El FL@@ ACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slender body stat@@ ur . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the Val@@ dez Office has been given to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , who prot@@ ested against the Mor@@ de von journalists , because the employees have become something that they have never expected : activists in the name of the press .
in a few words , Miri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez bred a few signs and went on to a demonstration on the next morning for an additional journalists to the office of the State .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared for three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western federal state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his point .
throughout the country , journalists have become more involved in which they have written in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on walking paths and buildings .
on this day the director Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is going to Washington and tries to collect international support for the justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a , on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities , journalists journalists and they get to the truth because she said the truth .
she has been asked about that it has been dealt by the government again because they wor@@ ried about their objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeated that journalists in Mexico of organized crimes , participated in government officials and a valid society . &quot;
in his last book , Nar@@ co journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ters are not only killed by drugs , but also on orders of politicians and security forces using the organized crime under a blanket .
last year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; has over half of the attacks on journalists from the police and officials .
&quot; in Mexico , you &apos;d like to find because she would like to make the mouth of the mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , Mor@@ de has obviously have a terrible effect .
no one finds the death of the blo@@ gging Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as before six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ set features in addition to their separate head .
some branches have chosen as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern boundary state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assassination of correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do , as it did El Man@@ ana by Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo , after the assassination of their direct investment in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez was publicly accessible to the drug card with an article on the front page with the &quot; What do you want to us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home country , or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find out work in exile , and observe the roads and search for dangers .
and sometimes they are st@@ alled , as it was apparently the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue work , it is a daily dance with risk @-@ sufficient decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , the once poet his poet , announces that the drug stores it to him .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I was re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce began on the civil service and d@@ rank beer , when once all their phones began to mar@@ es .
a series of shooting covered with band@@ ri@@ vals and security forces near the beach of Maz@@ at@@ lan , 19 confirmed dead dead .
the war continued further , as it was promised by a number of anti@@ ell em@@ b@@ assies in the region .
on the board side , they have released the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce about mobile .
the front page was to be changed on the next day .
Sir@@ ens are close proximity to - another piece of shooting in the area .
Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers to see the guard , to see if they were in willingness .
if they were afraid , they did not show it .
under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose mid@@ finger was visible for the Sin@@ alo@@ a , followed the employee of Ri@@ odo@@ ce his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how can you do not remember that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said on that same day , to which J@@ avier was murdered , people asked to send us on the road to the road . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to so@@ aking his enemies
at the first glance , it looks like a statue , if a fri@@ gh@@ tening .
researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mines so well received that experts were described as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even find that his dra@@ gging skin of red@@ dish brown was - and they said , she would have had anything from a &quot; un@@ calm past . &quot;
the report in the magazine &quot; Cur@@ rent Biology , &quot; called Din@@ osau@@ rs , who was found ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs pieces of the world . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ ri@@ ans who lived in the middle of the chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition , researchers , who describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Geographic , the ge@@ p@@ anz@@ zed plant f@@ ress@@ er is the best preserved F@@ ossi@@ l of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn funk , when he was born on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ ny Mill@@ enium Mine , near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray , in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something , which seemed to be seen from the surrounding rocks on the Plat@@ ze , and decided to take more precisely .
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within 2,500 pounds ( 1,100 lbs ) to be able to cover heavy animals within 2,500 pounds ( 1,100 lbs ) .
after all of this hard work , the finished result is ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you are only a little bit with the eyes , you could believe that it &apos;s slaugh@@ tered , &quot; said the main writer Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the cre@@ ature is to be seen .
&quot; it will be one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specimens - Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this crop f@@ ress@@ er , although he is covered with a arm@@ oured tanks , probably from meat and send din@@ osau@@ rs .
the din@@ osau@@ rs used din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide himself before smoking , and used a par@@ agli@@ ding technology that is known as counter@@ att@@ ing , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to blend its surroundings in its surroundings and to suit its enemy , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year old cre@@ ature of the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines in May and is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and studied Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mitch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours .
the amazing preservation of a copy it allowed to document the Mitch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the patterns and the form of shoes and arm@@ our over his body .
they discovered the consistency , a spread of the defense method in animal , which means that the tip of the cre@@ ature was dark@@ er than its base .
although the result is common , the results are surprisingly , as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the size of the Bo@@ real@@ op@@ ta are far beyond the animals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the din@@ osau@@ rs are believed that the din@@ osau@@ rs are covered by a sufficient pressure by carni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the evolution of the confron@@ tation as a means of life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but most of contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ lu@@ sion@@ ing - think of Reh@@ e , zeb@@ ra or belt - are much smaller and viol@@ ate as prey , causing sign@@ alized that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real struggle for survival .
&quot; strongly Rau@@ b@@ tier behavior on a massive , powerful din@@ osau@@ rs are showing how dangerous din@@ osau@@ rs are to have been certain as dangerous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; he said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scrip@@ tions also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ ri@@ ers was red .
scientists continue to examine the animal on evidence over his life , including his con@@ served Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes , to figure out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs is dead , when he died , in a river and to the sea , where he s@@ unk on the back to the sea .
at this time , Alberta was so warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much more land than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really interesting , because it is fully covered with servi@@ ced skin , but also in three dimensions , and the original form of the animal is retained , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal is almost as almost as in the early chal@@ k time .
you don &apos;t need a lot of imagination to construct it . if you are only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the chal@@ k period was a time when huge Ther@@ op@@ ods , carni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , who stood on two legs stood out on earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ge@@ p@@ anz@@ zed din@@ osau@@ rs was carried out by some of his fur@@ ter ancestors .
this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ ular osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , their latest results in the journal Cur@@ rent Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was mu@@ ddy after the death in the sea , and mu@@ ddy in mud .
the creation was found by Sha@@ wn funk , when he was born on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ ny Mill@@ enium Mine , near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray , in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum , it is the dominant Din@@ osau@@ rs in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the schn@@ au@@ ze until the hill .
the cre@@ ature was raised at an average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tips that made by his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ge@@ p@@ anz@@ zed plant f@@ ress@@ er is covered by Western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river , floo@@ ded into the open sea .
but the underwater trays of the din@@ osau@@ ri@@ ers protect his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the hidden rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well received that the Hau@@ tre@@ est still tast@@ ed tank panels along the din@@ osau@@ rs .
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko for National Geographic , is a such level of the preservation of such as &apos; rarely , as a profit in the Lot@@ to .
the more I see it , the confused , it gets .
remains of the skin ; still the hol@@ iness of tank may still carry on the sk@@ ull of the animal &apos;s sk@@ ull .
his re@@ chter front foot is on his side , his five fingers crossed to the top .
I can count the d@@ olls at his sole . &quot;
in the th@@ under@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many verses
intense accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass oscill@@ ation .
there are numerous spread , kilometer @-@ long st@@ aff@@ er and aff@@ er .
at the late Thursday of Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) on the afternoon of Thursday afternoon at a Mass@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age , some 20 people were injured .
according to the first data of the police , at 17.00 o &apos;clock between the connecting Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a storm @-@ almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , in@@ stituted .
above the exact number of the last publishers did not show any data .
it is a slight ten@@ sion@@ ary for slight to moderate injuries , said a pol@@ ze@@ al pre@@ acher .
a great offer to rescue vehicles was an accident on the accident .
the A8 was fully closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , approximately 10 kilometres long back @-@ st@@ au .
as a AZ @-@ re@@ porter , it was also reported on the counterpart to massive disability - by many G@@ aff@@ er .
the Fire Department listed the license number of vehicle hand@@ le@@ men who now have with more sensitive stra@@ ps .
shortly after 18 : 45 pm there was still a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was also a coll@@ ision between a car sport and a car in the car .
a rescue @-@ helicopter was on the way to the accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German railway : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a moment which almost everyone has experienced : nothing is sitting in the train and sleep .
or man is lower in his work and has just got an ingeni@@ ous thoughts .
and then : buff@@ f .
comes from the Schaff@@ ner and w@@ anting for a un@@ fold or strike the passenger right in the middle of the workout .
driving control .
but the days of the interrup@@ tions are soon past .
the Germans are currently tested the s@@ less mile@@ age control .
it is confirmed , simply by phone the ticket is taken place and make the ticket to the ticket .
currently , a test operation runs on two tracks .
&quot; the offer of which we made it . &quot;
then , in the beginning of this year , there will be expected to be available on many further remote transport routes in Germany , &quot; said a train @-@ spokesman .
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the ticket implementation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to use this , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : one needs a smartphone or a tablet .
and you must have booked an online ticket , which already do we do for most passengers .
you also have to bought it on the app of the Bahn , DB navig@@ ator , which is why the most comfortable type of the ticket price is .
and most recently , you need a seat reservation .
for the &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; works such as : you take in the train , calls his ticket to &quot; My Tickets . &quot;
during the test customers , a button will appear in the electronic resolution .
the train station get a message on their mobile devices a message that the guest rooms is located in the train and the ge@@ bu@@ si@@ dered seat Y .
comes the train conductor at the ticket control system at number Y he knows that there is a Pass@@ ag@@ ier with previously untreated Online @-@ ticket .
so , you can continue to pass further , continue straight ahead .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn is to use the passengers .
&quot; if you want to travel without a ticket control through our train personnel , I would like to try himself in the DB navig@@ ator .
this enables the passengers to design their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Board of DB Fern@@ traffic .
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to go to the individual customer needs . &quot;
those who travels to train , knows that in addition to the late and missed trains of the ticket checks are among the largest sle@@ eves .

how an activist was to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken by her core .
just one day after they arrived in New York City , the St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene sat on the bed of a Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment which rented for rent and sc@@ roll@@ out by Facebook on their phone .
you stum@@ bled on a post of somebody from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; name was there .
confused , since no one else had received the information on her Feed , she finished Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly reached on her tim@@ eline .
the R@@ apper , in St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mo . , live on live .
he post@@ ete a picture of Brow@@ ns for blos@@ som , which was stretched out on the road and would stay there four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the death was nothing new for them and their community nothing new .
she finished her phone as soon as you return on twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive in the evening .
there were Photos from the police band and people who brought together , and by a man , who held the Father &apos;s Father , who brought him a sign with the inscription : &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ ons police had just killed my in@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live scores , where a police force is a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ ishing dog .
in another video , she said , secured a other polic@@ eman , and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... Pets all kill you . &quot;
&quot; this is not common &quot; that Fer@@ rell came to her statement . &quot;
&quot; this is not the way of murder where we are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to us , and that we could be able to know . &quot;
at this moment I felt Schüt@@ t .
I was w@@ aged and we@@ eping . &quot;
they booked a return flight and went on the next day after the house .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 @-@ year old daughter from the house of her father , and decided that the two next morning to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on would drive to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinemas starting from 11 .
it is a history of life and the protest , the love and the losses , the strength and the resistance force , which is out of the perspective of people living in the community and the streets are filled to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rell gave her daughter with her daughter , which wearing a flower @-@ dress and a matching crown , after Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , speaking the two conversation , which she had countless years before this morning , &quot; over the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t know you how I taught you , when the black people must fight for the fight , what they believe that they believe ? &quot; she rec@@ alled what she said . &quot;
&quot; we now go to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not correct .
I did not take it , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; what happened today is , is a highlight of the ... what happened in the past .
you have to know it and be viewed in it .
it must be well developed , not only activity and organisation , but also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution , and what we need to do to liber@@ ate ourselves to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even if I have good fortune to give you an experience , where they don &apos;t have an ek@@ lat@@ ism , it is not otherwise known as the next black women @-@ child .
I feel the feeling , I would give you a poor service to keep them away . &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , situated on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authorities , considered the activists of the potential non @-@ indictment by Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there is Fer@@ rell and her daughter with local business owners where lunch made .
they prepared pockets before and hal@@ ted them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly started a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
after August 9 , totally changes , &quot; she said , &quot; said she and noticed that she was focused as a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on Ess@@ ens @-@ justice and health im@@ balances in black commun@@ es .
&quot; I did not experience any experience in the organs .
everything has come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met the Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an evening , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to only document &quot; document &quot; what happened .
a question came from Fer@@ rell to the meaning : &quot; want to document their document or trying to find a story that can you use ? &quot;
this sc@@ ep@@ sis was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of White , in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and their resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who were born in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and grew up , and raised their voices , and we wanted to make it different . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , a artists from the area that is known for his activ@@ ism or To@@ de@@ stra@@ ct occup@@ ants .
his engagement , Fer@@ rell brought the project closer together with six other locals and the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me how these people are represented , for as I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the objective was not to concentrate on Fer@@ re@@ lls experience - to show that it comes to the movement &quot; not by the Messi@@ ah leader , &quot; but by a community , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most important participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ re@@ lls lives as she loves and married to her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and l@@ eighth said when they saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ re@@ lls repe@@ ats the role of black spon@@ ge women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three founders of the movement that followed after the kill@@ ings of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; have been instrumental in social media .
&quot; black , pregnant women in manag@@ erial positions held the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are fighting on different fron@@ ts .
black , pregnant women must have to carry the main load of all . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an voted to notice that &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot;
it is however , however , that &quot; this is not a wi@@ ver type of action , &quot; in the Fer@@ rell has been selected as a heart of the film .
&quot; she was the person strug@@ gling in this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it &apos;s no coincidence , although she was in front of the front , because of life on these cross@@ ings as a black , pregnant women as much on the game .
you can see their energy by the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the news agencies have long been gone in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , but the racial connections between the church and the police exist .
Fer@@ rell is on the currency for 2 ½ years due to block@@ age of the highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social atmosphere of the area , which she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless , she danced to a singing and feel at that memory , since she has lived in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on on the street three years ago .
&quot; it is our mandatory to fight for our freedom . &quot;
it is our mandatory to win .
we need to love each other and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; up to &quot; magnit@@ ude &quot; : TV readers &quot; discuss the bit gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping center on the Sü@@ ver of the pedestrian zone has been ob@@ sol@@ ete since the first presentation of 2009 the population in ob@@ serving and opponents .
cold is hardly any cold on the subject .
also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; on our Facebook page .
while one of the bit gallery says : &quot; this would be a dream ( &quot; An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; The would be real class &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ages ) or simply by simply : &quot; magnit@@ ude ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the advoc@@ ates to ensure that a gallery will benefit more customers in the city , of which the remaining stores will benefit , will fear the opponents that the pedestrian zone has become a blood@@ stream .
added : the gallery is set up exactly on the premises in which the peas@@ antry is available , in the 13 high @-@ market products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be finished .
the Galerie M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - namely the Bed@@ a Square , to the outside of seats .
Simone Room : &quot; we buy one week for many years now in the peas@@ antry hall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the land of land is still very happy .
we discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to wish us that , and above all , after the construction of the gallery , we would have a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there are also the same .
the small exhibition hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ensing , &quot; if you are direct from the market in a brand hall in the gallery , coming on the amount of rent .
the should probably be too low too low . &quot;
Eva Ki@@ lic : &quot; to do the shopping Palace in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dro@@ pping or supermarkets : I find the superf@@ lu@@ ous fluid .
there are already enough in our city .
you see how many shop stores here are empty - some for months and years .
but there is not even a regular weekly market here , the more important that will be at least the market hall remains at least .
for anyway , the commodity has been freshly made , most of which is offered directly from producers and is also reasonably priced .
as you see , Lad@@ in stores will be rented in a shopping mall only of larger companies , because there are no retail@@ er for a retail@@ er often .
too bad , there is almost no more and that , which is still left , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a mall with a brand hall fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the peas@@ mark@@ thalle during construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even on duration when the bit gallery is actually sometime actually .
or it creates the bit @-@ bit gallery already , all business from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this is simply not work .
and a shopping center , the empty is still no one needs .
I have been better to promote a real peasant market instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant mark@@ thalle , it has no place thanks to the w@@ rench . many - as I find - sensu@@ ally construction projects in Bit@@ burg no space anymore .
if the peas@@ antry is cap@@ sul@@ ated , it will disappear again a piece of culture . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the smokers of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are seen - white , black and brown that are almost un@@ strange equal - that are caused by the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , from the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , which have been sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from prison in Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence analyst at the former diplomatic relations after they made public relations with the site of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks over the site of the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition , which opened on 2 August , A B@@ ecom@@ ing Res@@ em@@ blan@@ ce ( An matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y and Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was transformed into technology , computer sciences and art , and Mann@@ ing , a cross @-@ woman who had been converted to Barack Obama , as he had only three days in his ministry .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which could look like someone with these gen@@ omic data , could not only be interpreted to the for@@ tification of DNA data - which can be interpreted as they can be interpreted as well as the inherent detection of these interpret@@ ations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing who was born as Bradley Edward was born in 2013 , but has already been condemned as a woman as a woman in 2013 , including six crimes against the spy law , computer fraud and theft .
due to the prison , her picture was supp@@ ressed , so there was only a single picture - a liqu@@ e@@ worthy , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in the man &apos;s clearly visible on a driver &apos;s seat and has been associated with platinum @-@ plat@@ ine per@@ ish .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came just from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project &apos; strand Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in this , the artist portraits of foreign workers produced from for@@ te Art@@ ef@@ acts as cigarettes and chew@@ ing gum by removing the DNA from waste , to produce a picture of it , such as those people would look like .
that was the time at that time was an e @-@ mail by an newspaper magazine .
a interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg during a press show .
and she could not be visited at this time and she could not go photographed , so they took out contact with Chelsea and asked them whether they wanted a DNA portrait .
in the course of two years , the artist and its incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were trained to exchange several letters in the course of two years .
they created a shooting of Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated comic book &quot; support images &quot; which saw a future fore@@ seen in which the president of Chel@@ cias would convert and im@@ migr@@ ate to the exhibition .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings was asking for seven most violent years in Kansas City , was a welcome kind of happy re@@ union .
there are also at the opening of the exhibition somewhat deep and st@@ ark@@ es , because Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ t from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , a straight @-@ enabled ways to fix the rigid sp@@ ares , which actually should be solved , further to un@@ spo@@ iled .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg after the strange Tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in one of the gallery led artistic statement called Mann@@ ing with their over@@ sized signature , including the &quot; i &quot; in their family name , with a heart of the &quot; automatic sh@@ atter@@ ing , &quot; whose basis is sex , race , sex , and culture . &quot;
the opposite wall is the mitochondri@@ al DNA sequence - an thous@@ and@@ feed of Cs and Gs and As , in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cl@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) as amazing , at least in biological regard we all are .
&quot; what people are going to take that our gen@@ ome does not mean that we are , and how are genetic data for a interpretation and as subj@@ ectively they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , too .
the &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition that is kept in an own space , is a page from the above mentioned co@@ mic Nov@@ elle .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as they have written with a acqu@@ itt@@ el@@ ef@@ on in the hand from the disciplinary control of the United States as King @-@ Kong .
&quot; if they make your speech your speech , then she won , &quot; said it . &quot;
so , the mouth never goes to the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it was directly out of a letter which she has written me , &quot; said the artist , who died from Philadelphia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m still looking back , when I speak about . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has seen the exhibition not personally - as it was pre@@ dic@@ tive to the cartoonist - but if it should do it , then it will be greeted in the middle of the room of mas@@ ons , from their own no@@ mi@@ cal simul@@ ates , which is like hormon@@ es of prot@@ ra@@ fting .
that was also targeted , as all in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , in which its genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups had been written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had at the wall , but I wanted to feel like a human quantity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was of portraits of portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel that it feels like a mass movement that feels like a mass movement , like the movement , which are also behind their liberation . &quot;

a nationwide human @-@ hunt is in progress for a professor at North@@ western University and one of the University of Oxford , as susp@@ ects for a man in a luxury apartment in Chicago .

&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future , &quot; - the Russian prime minister Mut@@ ko
the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said that it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for recovery of Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a particular stage of the implementation of the driver &apos;s criteria R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan to plan and test Ukrain ( UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) in cooperation with Ukrain .
the WA@@ DA @-@ road@@ map was updated in this regard , &quot; says Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the schedule of the WA@@ DA , to compliance with the code , which describes the criteria for the re@@ inst@@ ation of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain nothing to return to Russia for the occasion .
everything was announced , everything is implemented .
and the results are presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in near future , &quot; added to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
however , one of the most important criteria reported in the list of criteria that the Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing authorities approved the results of the WA@@ DA regulatory approval by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state @-@ funded dop@@ ings in the Russian sport .
regarding the affair , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the examination because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system had allowed an error .

R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the Dop@@ ing Sk@@ and@@ als by the WA@@ DA from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
it was allowed to coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the major qu@@ arti@@ ers of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Olivier Nig@@ gli stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA declared itself in the right direction of &quot; moves to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help you help to become the next u@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ rett wanted to measure your employees the luck with your e @-@ commerce @-@ up , but the qu@@ eries do not work .
answers were often v@@ age , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently .
and even if you spoke to An@@ onymous , sad some workers do not resist the trial .
&quot; there was just never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ rett , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Re@@ ed .
it was called people from the outside .
a new breed of the human resources start @-@ ups is to help the company to help companies how to feel their employees .
by the preparation and licensing of software , which has to perform the specific purpose of the measurement of employees , enabling it to provide special groups and demographic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow C @-@ suite executives and turn right at the Board of Directors .
they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nice , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive Officer of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools has been used to measure employees .
Er@@ rett said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel up in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the sn@@ ap p@@ olls and surveys from certain teams , there is a heat @-@ card of the company that shows most of the complaints , and what managers have their questions , and what managers have low order results - so you can go back , why .
companies are coming to , in order to remain at the top of the workplace culture , so that a former employee has been published in Sk@@ and@@ ale , who has been published a blog post since then , who describes an environment of Bel@@ or@@ ations in which those who have spoken , were pun@@ ished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of lu@@ cra@@ tive business possibility .
the Global Governance , Regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18,@@ 7 billion value , according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ t , the company helps to prevent bad behavior , saw a rising interest and activity in the beginning of this year , in the middle of the u@@ ber F@@ everything in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ t can send a custom &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; surveys , trusted answers in real @-@ time and the heat @-@ maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous release of an SMS hot@@ line , with the employees of bad behavior .
and if the main business is included , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the Court of public Opinion about the regulations &quot; council , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ t .
if a company is found that his employees will have treated bad or itself in@@ eth@@ ically , it may experience precious consequences through consumers - Bo@@ yk@@ ott , workers - Flu@@ tu@@ ation and Kl@@ agen , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , conver@@ cent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and process , and a simple way to achieve its corporate headquarters .
earlier when an employee was wanted to notify , he had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously seriously .
it was often a limitation and un@@ f@@ eme experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good opportunity to track the complaints of employees .
well , as the company conver@@ ti@@ cent can help problems that were in offices in cities or states , hidden in offices in cities or states , hidden - such as discrimination , bel@@ lows or un@@ l@@ atures intern@@ ship are identified , identified , in offices in cities or states .
&quot; I can closer to this hol@@ istic , 360 @-@ degree visibility in the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management Group of Ruby on Tuesday .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders before employment . &quot;
companies started in ethics , ethics , values and employees of commitment to 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen said , Qu@@ in@@ lan said that Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
but it took it until the &quot; soci@@ als of media came to her right , &quot; that companies did not prevent that you could not prevent their dirty ling@@ ers online .
&quot; before the use of Technology on the surveillance of ethics , people used as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ t offer your software as a service provider , and the company with recur@@ ring fees for use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the agreement of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , bringing the whole capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ing took home to $ 10 million in November of Bess@@ emer Partner , and brought his total financing to $ 60 million .
this investment is hardly surprisingly , in view of the net@@ worked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex in research , which shows that today &apos;s staff are expected to expect more than so far .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only .
the staff want to feel that you are accepted and estimated that you will be able to give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to work in a company that will keep her vote , and that her work has also been committed to make this company , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In that are both Conver@@ t as well as G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach Rend@@ ites in return if their portfolio will run good . companies are running well , when workers are engaged and engaged .
if the Analytics Tools Division is third promise to raise commitment and use of employees , it &apos;s no wonder that you will find support .
the data regarding the experts of the workplace culture is important for the experts of the workplace culture .
but the data is us@@ eless when the car@@ et@@ ching of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it can be a anticip@@ ation that changing the way is on the way .
and if the change does not come quickly enough , or at all , this dis@@ appointment can sh@@ uts and employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 calls , you must have ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company to have left information on collecting data .
&quot; if you are not to follow , &quot; Do you ask , &quot; Have you heard me ?
take care of this ?
and if you do not take care of it , why should I mean ? &quot;
Madison Re@@ ed , who is now able to enter into action on the same day , if a problem was reported on the same day , if a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t .
in accordance with the feedback of fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was possible through the speed of decision making decision and quality of communication , to add several teams within the company and to add a communication training to add the problems .
in Ruby Tuesday , the company receives new insights into the staff , and hopes to hopes for a long time of view , which leads to a better quality of workers in the industry , is well known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you &apos;ll lose the people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose customers .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .
N@@ CA@@ A removing the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the bru@@ ins
it goes on 23 o &apos;clock as a lot of U@@ CL@@ A pitch players on one side of the new exercise fields of the teams met on the campus .
some have gone out their tri@@ cot , and show the back full of silence of the first day of the workout .
for a good part of the teams , these unt@@ ains a lunch break .
players who registered at the summer courses are expected to return to their final day , after three hours of exercise will return to their final departure before they return at 6 : 30 am to the water man Football Center .
&quot; this is for the guys for the next three days a real sp@@ ind@@ le mill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday was Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ day exercises to make the load of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training session of the U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 PM will start in order to meet the players all @-@ packed players around the players .
the compromise way from the two days is more than a day when Bru@@ ins had moved to the beginning of Camp@@ s almost one week after the last season and during the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in western wood exercises .
it should be set in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the start of the formal preparations for its re@@ opening against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he is the control of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they make the much employment of the player to be added a further point .
&quot; we lay these enormous loads three or four days on it , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they simply ste@@ er it , they would be back , they are great people .
I think as soon as we come until Saturday and we have time , it will really great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will be able to finish its practices in view of the clear view of its fields of an adjacent parking and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel which has been subjected to foot from a tor@@ tilla , which is not a light up for a tor@@ sion .
Bru@@ ins players are supposed to occupy the hotel as of this weekend , but Mor@@ a made a problem that there could be a problem , as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our safety , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far away to think that the people rent there a room and then set there to set up a exercise .
if you have the vide@@ ob@@ and of a exercise , it is a pretty good shop .
but we have visited security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best , with what we have .
I do not make me too great wor@@ ried .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against f@@ ake messages
Facebook wants more potential articles with false messages in the Third Reich and their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network , said that it is one of his efforts to combat F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in a statement on his website , that it will begin with the use of upgraded training methods , to detect a possible wrong reports and they may send to factor response , possibly results of the facsimile check out of the original article .
Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main points , so called F@@ ake @-@ News , of which many believe that they have also been influenced by the US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem is also floo@@ ded in Europe with a great political theme , but the French vot@@ ers support a plan that could be pun@@ ished in May with the social media networks , if it does not succeed them to eliminate h@@ ass@@ ess@@ ful post@@ ings as before the elections held there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German states that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a review of the new facts were started .
in addition to the knowledge that the stories of facsimile are the third parties , the people want to find out more context to meet the decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , Product Manager for Facebook News in a blog .
added to the fact that Facebook will continue to be able to test his feature &quot; in conjunction with the article &quot; and on other changes to its news Feed works to reduce false news .
creating a comic novel about a comic novel , a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video at a squee@@ ze for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ 3 years .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years in a turbul@@ ent history of his cozy seat in the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphical novel of Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ed Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ one with a love for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look on the manuscript by somebody which has been dead for 300 years , &quot; says he says we@@ aken .
&quot; what to keep a personal relationship with this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ a Castle in England &apos;s s@@ lows the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families appearing in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another British artist together - Isaac Kra@@ ley , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on a archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he found un@@ expect@@ edly .
&quot; I only re@@ acted on the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter in the 1700 &apos;s , he was written for the Jak@@ ob@@ iner , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his thum@@ b print !
and sent letters to smoke , since then , one fire was f@@ ected because of the light .
for anyone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect when he would be too .
dear , oh , ich Archive ! &quot;
for anyone who run with old papers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council in England , and nearly four months in a castle lived ( &quot; To be honest : I have always rated a little bit &quot; ) it seems to be beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days in order to explore the archives and the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , as about the mon@@ ogra@@ mmed buttons on walls and the bottles , the centuries had spent in Gra@@ ben .
he emi@@ grated through the area and the ruins of the old castle , and said with Land@@ ing sp@@ ans , gar@@ ner@@ ed and sometimes also worked with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night , d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was only published in 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
as Rho@@ des one decade later , the employees had just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years ago , in which Arist@@ ok@@ t said , &quot; Oh , wir@@ f it on the attic . &quot;
Ta@@ geb@@ ra , letters from the time of the English Em@@ pi@@ res , maps that they would like that land @-@ conflicts would like to be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a pe@@ ke to have two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all his course ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the castle rebuilt in order to join the farmhouse of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a recording of a listing , the 13@@ 80 castle in the castle , in this book entitled &quot; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of Kent and Sus@@ sex &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the peas@@ antry began in this area and I thought , an uprising was a good start .
perhaps the two are connected with each other ? &quot;
other stories are fixed in the history of the castle , like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who told the history of the Jesu@@ it priest , which grew seven years during the English re@@ formation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , presented in the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th Century who filled his own burial with stones ( a discovery that was only made years later than his Sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ re@@ lls are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the men seemed to be hi@@ ther@@ ed Ga@@ un@@ er , and again , and spend the money for things that they couldn &apos;t know .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men &apos;s men they mar@@ ries their school@@ ing , by having rich old women - I found myself as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys who were with a talent to destroy a land@@ locked . &quot;
after the end of its use in the castle , Rho@@ des is in the search for another unique write experiences .
he has a two weeks stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ men , behind the site of a san@@ atorium in the early 20th century , which was back to the nature of nature .
but Scot@@ ney made a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad , back again , &quot; he says .
it was like : &quot; oh , now I must be finished with the dam@@ s life . &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mary @-@ chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf .
with the hil@@ ation of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mary @-@ chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched her campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( round Rund@@ schau Thursday ) .
even until Thursday , Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team fell by Nelson Ar@@ tz , the logo and the slogan .
by the end of August , it should be the cli@@ max of the campaign as a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nice for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or ? , &quot; ask the makers of action since yesterday at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel .
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) do not really , &quot; write it up on her last un@@ locked website .
&quot; we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make it clear that man@@ ches is better than it seems .
basically , we are the firm conviction that we are known as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer to know the beauty and attra@@ c@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
with the action let it be more than &quot; a logo and a slogan , it &apos;s more .
&quot; it is true , a single promise to form@@ ulate , one that the city is a distinctive unique feature . &quot;
finally , it was in competition with other local communities .
the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f can make their new roof brand and the campaign cost .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Earth &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , Ankara participated in Ankara the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) over Pen@@ sion@@ ings and findings in the army corps .
this week , this week .
on the first glance , a normal process .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup .
the meeting took place in the building of general staff , as earlier , but in the office of the prime minister .
under the leadership of the government , the government leaders now also took the five prime minister , as well as the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , and Foreign Affairs .
thus they were civilians in the Y@@ as in the overseas .
the government attracts the trains in the military .
general of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar has remained in the office but the commander of the He@@ eres , the Air Forces and the Marine have been sold .
since the failed coup , leader of Staff of the 3@@ 26 Gener@@ als has been re@@ char@@ ds and add @-@ up .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army of the army , mostly due to alleged connections to the exile of exile @-@ Pre@@ dig@@ ging Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah , the Erdo@@ gan as a wire rope .
against 4@@ 86 people , who have been involved in the coup attempt , have been involved in Ankara in this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow of &quot; God , &quot; because he give him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot;
but the Erdo@@ gan really had the army really in the grip ?
in late February , the newspaper &quot; H@@ ür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ rest in the military headquarters . &quot;
in the general scale it will give birth to a growing &quot; Islamic &quot; of the army , among other things , among other things , among others , wrote in the re@@ vocation of the head of military personnel , &quot; wrote the newspaper .
the large @-@ scale plant in the army and the security forces continues anyway .
in the middle of July , Erdo@@ gan updated another 73@@ 95 state aid , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
in fact , it seemed to be Erdo@@ gan &apos;s military to the military .
gener@@ als were former in the country as the actual men of the country .
she had three times a put@@ ative on appeal to their role as a guard of the world state aid .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan of the military leaders returned to step by step , not least on appeal to the reform of the European Union .
former officers say , Erdo@@ gan di@@ vul@@ be targeted a Islam@@ alization of armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; in particular , not so @-@ called officer who sought after the coup attempt on fears of persecution in foreign countries , the Turkish army would be in few years &quot; full extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
this is true , such development could not be cold in NATO .
in the Alliance , there are doubts in the Alliance after the pur@@ ge of doubt about the Turkish army .
the leadership of leadership and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; by NATO diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
it will be a new U.S. immigration plan to modify the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he sees to reduce the leg@@ alisation to 50,000 per year , more stringent regulations for the visa @-@ oriented visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented Visa .
the new rules will be proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce the poverty rate , wages and billion dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers will save and will do by using the U.S. and way , such as the citizens from other countries will be issued . &quot;
the law will replace the chains migration and replace the current system .
this new applic@@ ants will come to the candidates who speak English to support the financial funding to support themselves and knowledge that our economy would be good , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quotes from the American media .
the Ministry of Ministry for Renn@@ es &quot;
again , over the past months , more than the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les have been cont@@ ested , so it &apos;s going to go fast .
still before the end of the year , the tourist trip is to be built on the tourist destination .
to ensure the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les @-@ long term , according to the traffic Ministry of Agriculture in this year &apos;s construction work on the track .
with the decision to order the Ilmen@@ au @-@ Renn@@ sti@@ g track , the country plan to order to order this , especially for tourism in particular , &quot; says Verkehrs@@ State Secretary Klaus Sü@@ hl , on Friday in Erfurt .
the expenses for the repair of the circuit he climbed to about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country is 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , will be present at the present time , explained Sü@@ hl .
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen District as well as the operator are already agreed upon the technical details .
&quot; thus , the road@@ map , the used vehicles and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; said Sü@@ hl .
the scheduled contract between the Ministry of Ministry and railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
so that the race @-@ to @-@ shuttle shuttle will be ordered regular at December 2017 .
the race @-@ shuttle shuttle is a particularly popular train link between the railway stations Ilmen@@ au and Renn@@ sti@@ g .
in the past months , during a pilot @-@ operated pilot , whether the track has been used enough for many people to order it again in the future .
the route is also large in parts of areas .
the ascent of sex robot is real , and we should make us wor@@ ried about
just as you thought that it can not be crazy about 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the range of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently published the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ( Stiftung responsible for responsible robo@@ tics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , a professor of robo@@ tics and artificial intelligence on the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take their ascent .
customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , select its form of chest and the type of fing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; the people do have fun , but the company provide a lot of lot of it , and we &apos;ll get much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the release of his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicon w@@ ret@@ ina , which warm warm - with respect to human reactions , which can be achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also be able to adjust its robot &apos;s robot &quot; and select everything from the eye of the robot over the form of the robot up to type or the color of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it is still un@@ qui@@ eter , as many robots could possess the &quot; personalities , &quot; which would look for a Step@@ ford &apos;s Woman .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robo@@ tics with a silicon w@@ ret@@ ina .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot enables users to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties , which they are respon@@ sive as for example .
and then there is the True @-@ called Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of attacks and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality who has been adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; says the website of True To@@ on .
so you may like what you like , and they may not like what you do not like etc .
it has , in the course of the day , your mood - quite like true people !
you can &apos;t be tired , fixed at Con@@ vers@@ ation , or it can be &quot; in mood . &quot;
there are many be@@ aded aspects on this rise of sex robot - but not least because they replace real human relations - but the sub@@ mitting female features , when you get a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : stre@@ ak ) Far@@ rah , be@@ un@@ quiet one at most .
on his website , True To@@ on Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a Vi@@ br@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vi@@ br@@ ator , why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is on the website .
however , these sex robots are not only a Fe@@ tish or , just another sex toy .
their emergence and increasing refin@@ ery on some dark@@ er and pe@@ ale it in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of equality of the gen@@ ders to a desire to sex with sub@@ mitting as optional .
most men are of course no sex robot , and during the FR@@ R , they still remain equal popularity on the edge of the consumer culture .
but what of the constra@@ int zones , can be found in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very did@@ actic .
and many people are not strange or bel@@ lied by them the free market until they use the free market .
there are some surprise that these highly developed sex robots in a period of time , in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which the White House gives an president that att@@ ested to women sexually mature .
the most terrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ s &apos; s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images that dev@@ our bodies and the aus@@ och@@ es eyes , but as real@@ istically this vision acts .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment , this doesn &apos;t feel like a great lea@@ p .
the objective behind these sex robot is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as technically as technically possible ( even with Por@@ no@@ star Pro@@ por@@ tions ) .
their builder want to feel , that they feel human being , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , in the point when it goes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robot is no real women .
you cannot go away from their companion or simply walk away .
do not have any communication or background history , nothing , what could happen on independence or anything else what the imagination of the imagination could be dis@@ rup@@ ted .
otherwise stated : they are f@@ ake slaves .
or to press it in the Rede@@ mp@@ se of 2017 : rank of service
Tr@@ um@@ ps great power ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney for the concept of healthy human rights
it has become a Bin@@ sen@@ we@@ ish@@ eit of the tr@@ ump era that the political sp@@ ares , which have pol@@ arized by the U.S. elect@@ orate , even families in small format .
around Christmas and Ern@@ est was held in the USA , with advice on how to use the horror of tr@@ ump @-@ sel@@ ing relatives .
we rigor@@ ous to all of the bl@@ ings to let our filtering bub@@ bles .
less noticed is the power tr@@ um@@ ps , families together .
I mentioned this because my cousin , a centre @-@ oriented Di@@ chter@@ in , who lives in Chicago lives and has long been visited by the Repub@@ lics in our family , me this week in New York .
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a mighty effect .
with tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can association , with which she had fought decades because of the policy , suddenly and quite suddenly on the same side .
in order to make the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls in a further context that this is significant risk of risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the effect of his presidency took the force to move us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and lac@@ tation , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly possibility that us are no longer cast out of one day .
however , there is still a long @-@ term scenario , in which the ring Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which appears to appear on once in comparison to its standards suddenly as an officer of interro@@ gation .
I find me now from an active No@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s official version of the off@@ ence - the 14 % income tax ( but at least , we did not know how his tax statement ) - the both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact is a very mild criminal .
when tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be more spir@@ ulina to qualify as an unbe@@ atable improvement .
when my cousin came to the city , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Park@@ division , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city when one needs no caffeine .
the horses are enorm@@ ously high , the fi@@ bre@@ glass design on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ y and the animals rot@@ ate to look full of fear of their own shoulders - to watch out and the clim@@ atic music is quite a strange manner .
so many cl@@ ashes of a town houses : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not satisfy the dream .
five @-@ five years later , and I am not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is not a Swiss Cot@@ tage , the topics of the pub @-@ Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
however , Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange experience as there is two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ he years and all have a great time .
if I have made the Kar@@ us@@ sell on this site , I would have given him the full score , but luck@@ ily no one has asked about this .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store , my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions in a scale of up to five stars before I was able to draw my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my road , it &apos;s the same thing , plus the option to purchase an average of 15 % ti@@ pping - this to buy something about the charge table .
this is not only one of the slow@@ est , which should actually be a neutral exchange , but does not require pressure on the server to bring personality in a situation , which is not required .
the poor woman in the department store was comp@@ etes , while I had tired of the experience , giving my credit card with five stars .

Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or bad are except of them .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ ine of the ACE of Auto Club Europe are inv@@ alu@@ able :
is the new promotion is obligatory ?
no , the selected software updates are voluntarily sur@@ rendered .
&quot; the obligatory updates will only apply for the vehicles , the Schumann software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ ine .
their dis@@ arm@@ ament has ordered the drive @-@ drive ( KBA ) .
how , and when when , customer informs about updates ?
the manufacturer have announced an outstanding implementation in the next few months , but no exact date is called .
Daimler has informed us every person .
when the inspection is due to a inspection , that will be done in their framework .
how long will meet the upgra@@ ding machines ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ ine .
the curtains of the commitment of the manufacturer , as well as of political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , the author of the author are currently working on the environment at the environment . &quot;
how long should last update ?
the upgrade itself could last only three to four hours .
time consuming , it could be possible to get an appointment .
what do drivers do not make a car by BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
ACE of the ACE for finish .
presumably , foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ an@@ ine .
there is a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears this .
but in the regions , where riders are dro@@ ves .
in rural room there is no value @-@ loss for older diesel .
the ACE of the ACE , with a sale still is waiting .

we make the city life
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ achs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , dates back to the upcoming year in R@@ ente .
the place is already written - suitable applic@@ ants are ra@@ r .
for 31 years now W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work makes it still great fun as he conve@@ ys in the press conversation .
he reports from varied , but also challenging tasks that wait for his successor .
at the same time , it is admi@@ red that so far no application to meet the requirements profile .
the city is looking for the next time an architect and engineer .
so - at that point of regular termin@@ ation , it should be enough time for a work .
since Has@@ lach has been a judicial authorities for the Board of Admini@@ strative Authority and does not need to answer the application process .
for this function will keep the city to every case .
would they do not fill out this , would have to drive the citizens up to Off@@ enburg .
but the neighbourhood of the city and him also important , W@@ acker who reports from a good operating climate , and good mood between the authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in the office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back to the ch@@ acker with pride .
&quot; we make the city life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is safe for the building office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the future there are varied projects in the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ parking lot are being pushed .
the cinema bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium &apos;s stadium is still subject to the subject .
the latter is the latter - with around 1.5 million euros in the book alone , &quot; if we make it right , &quot; estimates W@@ acker .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was present for a city master house big game room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with Has@@ l@@ achs &apos;s own building yard and hor@@ t@@ ner@@ ei , it could be quite flexible .
&quot; you can move too much , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces will be affected by citizens and visitors .
since the old town as an ensemble , under monument protection , it is important to have , &quot; an eye to do , &quot; if new@@ buildings will be approved , emphas@@ ised by the schei@@ d city master .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister is high responsibility .
he is builder , &quot; at the end it runs all about my table . &quot;
at the time of care and coordination , he can count on long @-@ standing staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working for the past ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been working for the past 15 years .
also , that his successor remains a long time , W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really want to be identified with the place really identified and remain . &quot;
because continuity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the further design of the city .
those who wants Roland W@@ acker , would like to provide information about the city of Has@@ lach , as a diploma @-@ engineer or Bachelor with specialist device architecture and have good professional knowledge in the areas of construction and building planned .
Hoch@@ - und Tief@@ bau , Bau@@ planning , Gr@@ under@@ wer@@ bs@@ an@@ dis , managing director of urban properties , urban operation with building yard and municipal council , including monument protection .
bike ride on lines : southern rail line
according to police , the previously unknown off@@ ender had the blue bicycle from the track leis@@ urely in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener street ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so severely damaged that the her@@ ann@@ ah@@ ert@@ al freight could be carried out .
the investig@@ ators go from two male Tä@@ tern and are looking for the night hours after the night .
close to the scene of witnesses of a ros@@ ary roller and a bicycle @-@ driver had been observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz@@ ring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokesperson for AP@@ A , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ BB @-@ spokesperson for AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the or the perpet@@ rators could have brought themselves in large danger , even to the draw traffic .
in addition to damage at the Lo@@ k and the plant , as well as the late minutes and the cost of rail traffic , even P@@ ön@@ als of the customer could come to the perpet@@ rators .
overall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a total of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; sum &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were fixed on Friday morning again , the rail traffic in the south way could be managed without disabilities .
almost ten Person@@ s were out Friday morning , two of which concerned the remote traffic .
freight rail were not made , however , did delay .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokesperson , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged for about 200 metres .
isol@@ ators and Ma@@ sten were also damaged .
rot@@ ate meat , dairy products and chocolate could help the IB@@ D ( inflammatory bo@@ wel disease ) to lin@@ ders
red meat and chocolate can sound for your di@@ gestive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claimed the opposite : a diet that rich in meat @-@ based protein and milk products , the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases could occur .
the inc@@ ur@@ able condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States , affects approximately 1.3 million and caused a stomach , recur@@ rent or blu@@ ffs , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while the people usually offer , meat and dairy products , researchers found that researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of protein used to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , declared that immune cells in the intest@@ ine was pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ ben that hide himself in the food , not in the body .
cells that are im@@ pregn@@ ation of inflammation , inflammation of the cells are balanced to protect the tolerance and protect the body , without sensitive tissue .
when the balance is widely used in the direction of inflammation , it can result a inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
in experimental , it was found that a species of tolerance immune cell in mice found that a particular bacter@@ ium in its inser@@ ts .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the blocks of proteins and the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus re@@ uter@@ i - that is a normal portion of the intest@@ ine @-@ micro@@ bi@@ oms , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an could be mice in their food , the more had them made from these immune cells . &quot;
he proposed that the combination of L. re@@ uter@@ i and an tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an rich diet toler@@ ant , less inflammatory intestinal functions , if the same system also promotes people .
the Post@@ do@@ kt@@ or@@ and@@ in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan looked at the tolerance of tolerance , as they found out that a group of study groups had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that was separated from the same thing that was not separated .
it is believed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ al of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , who normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice of the mice were detected and have been found six species of bacteria that were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them were missing in mice .
mice were detected in a steril@@ ised environment , so that they were recorded in a micro@@ bi@@ om , and they were not developed in the immune cells , and they received L. re@@ uter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria could grow on the immune system , the researchers L. re@@ uter@@ i , in a liquid grow , then that small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - were isolated from the mice that were isolated from mice by mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
as the active component of the liquid is cleaned , it proved to be a tribut@@ ary of the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an metabolism , which is known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers have doubled the amount of such as tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the feed of mice increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an values are hal@@ ved , the number of cells fell by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us L. re@@ uter@@ i are protected in our gastro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known to whether tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an @-@ products from L. re@@ uter@@ i , such as mice , but def@@ ective in G@@ ens in relation to tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an were found in humans with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
she said , &quot; the development of these cells is likely that we want to promote inflammation in the inner surface of the Dar@@ ms .
potentially , high tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an values in the presence of L. re@@ uter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with Nem@@ anja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; in Manchester United , as Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pounds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , before the UEFA Cup season , before the UEFA Cup role played as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira after exposure .
however , he was excluded from the Pre @-@ Asia tour of the blues and took only 45 minutes , what Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho had to improve the start of the Premier League @-@ season before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way , as he think - he think , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready to be ready . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides M@@ atic started , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u Stadium in the Avi@@ va stadium , as Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho is his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho had three other re@@ counts of re@@ counts , but he insi@@ sted that the club already has a &quot; fantastic work &quot; made in three of its four priority projects .
three of them get four to you , thank you for the association , &quot; he added .

Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner into the sky
the Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots fled from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Michigan , and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner about the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens , the shape was a Dream@@ liner .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already been made earlier this advertising .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; was painted and the Boeing @-@ logo in the sky .
new deep step for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
like the wind , the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD Chief , the Socialist prime minister had always dealt with a certain concern in Berlin .
just no stor@@ bon@@ fires from the party headquarters , just no counter@@ wind from the Bund - that he was the most important desire of the election .
since Martin Schulz the party has since Martin Schulz has changed the fundament@@ ally .
since then , the staff from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus reached the events in the state capit@@ als of the state capit@@ als .
what Mr Schulz has been in the approach since the beginning of the year , it would not be described with counter@@ wind .
these were underground .
this is one of the other .
the League @-@ CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , a generic signal for Ko@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ Green can easily be reliably . &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber , editor of the editor of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising coup leader of a Green ME@@ Ps led the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) in a heavy crisis .
five months before the country @-@ day , its red @-@ green coalition thus lost its one @-@ vote majority to the Opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green federal managing director Michael wa@@ ner has asked the tr@@ is@@ ni@@ ge Lower Saxony @-@ MP El@@ ke Twe@@ sten to return to their mandate .
the transfer to CD@@ U means a clear violation of the elect@@ orate .
El@@ ke Twe@@ sten must be back in its mandate , &quot; said the Federal President and elect@@ oral campaign of the Green Society of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; that &apos;s all that is not true , &quot; inf@@ ested by the SPD &apos;s elect@@ oral party to meet the party &apos;s new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ wis@@ s party on Friday afternoon .
Stephan W@@ eil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the over@@ ride of the green ME@@ Ps El@@ ke Twe@@ sten to CD@@ U without their own government .
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of big and small crises in the SPD State associations .
and no one knows what happened next .
the missions started with the unexpected defeat in the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , no more , cal@@ ves the com@@ rades are at the time .
after the country elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia will all be different .
this was then also clearly worse - even though it was clearly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to Tau@@ ern , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite the Party of smoothly .
ar@@ du@@ ed the com@@ rades in the weeks afterwards again .
then , when they had just had new courage , G @-@ 20 summit arrived from Hamburg .
and with him the next bass stop .
mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Executive Chef , lost its Nim@@ bus at that weekend because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burnt down .
and because it did go wrong in crisis communication even so quite everything wrong , what you cannot go wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for survival .
now also Stephan W@@ eil .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust gas and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has already been critic@@ ised since longer in criticism .
in addition , mi@@ esis were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps just therefore , W@@ eil tried to put together stronger in the Bund acc@@ ented by the Bund .
the efforts of the former Mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin , remained with com@@ rades in the environment by Martin Schulz .
they were grant him because it spoke of W@@ eil a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite of the contrary .
it meets W@@ eil on the party &apos;s internal court , is basically no guil@@ t .
and Mr Schulz will not even exist .
one hour time , com@@ rades should therefore remain closed in their own rows .
her anger focuses on the Gre@@ ens , and here , above all , on the ab@@ tr@@ ash of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Assembly .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic . &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic over the interests of all other things , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party on the SPD Executive of the SPD , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mrs. Twe@@ sten is not guilty of its person as a direct candidate , but also voted the national list of the Lower Saxony Green Party , so the Lower Saxony Group .
the logical consequence , it would be that her mandate has with@@ drawn .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD Executive Committee , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeuvre . &quot;
four years ago , &quot; the vot@@ er@@ wil@@ le was clear : people have made Stephan W@@ eil as Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate in the federal election , the R@@ ND .
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U @-@ ME@@ Ps , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann .
he asked to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there have been more or further notice of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
promotion fees for Ort@@ ner III
who want to renov@@ ate his home in the years , will soon support the support from the country .
informed the mayor of Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ eg Urban Development on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler had once a look back to the so far .
since 1991 it has been in sens@@ ing reconstruction areas .
back then , in the renovation of the I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg still took over two third of the sponsors .
in the re@@ unification area II from 2005 to 2016 , the supplement was still at 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous refurb@@ ishment are a &quot; Succ@@ ess@@ ful project &quot; - it was finally important to promote the interior development , and not just new construction areas .
on April 4 , you have received the information from the governing body in Karlsruhe , will give information that there will be a renovation area III .
the total sum of 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which amounts to 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the community sens@@ ing .
how can now be re@@ refurb@@ ishment ?
you will continue to investigate so shame on , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it is also an important role if there are any interest in the planned interest in the planned interest .
this may also be once again to move again .
the j@@ etty went on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cell@@ ars presented the content of the federal states programme &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the re@@ stores will be carried out .
core of the programme are the Rev@@ it@@ alisation of the inner cities , improving the residential and working conditions and the infrastructure and expansion of the infrastructure .
the measures would be related to object , that is , per property .
the reconstruction area would then be set as a set .
the reference period for funding is running since January 1 , 2017 even until 30 . April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , only once the inventory will be carried out , in the context of which the questionnaire had a questionnaire to fill up a questionnaire .
in November or December , as possible as the constitution of the Statute , in order to be started with the refurb@@ ishment this year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that every Commune have to carry out the interests of evidence @-@ out investigations .
this is why the urban development culmin@@ ated on this site and decide when renovation , and in what extent .
it will be registered for the respective property as well as a refurb@@ ishment in the basic book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come again to sens@@ ing , and let us make a picture of the situation , she said .
Got@@ zel stressed , a distinctive success factor for the project was the co @-@ operation of the people .
therefore , fragments will be sent to citizens who are sent to citizens in the coming weeks , and can be filled until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; Building and basi@@ lica of the &quot; building , &quot; where there are among other things around the construction state and the refurb@@ ishment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data may be made with size , partition and inhabitants of a living room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the blue &quot; modes , &quot; is only fill if in the building business areas .
however , Got@@ zel referred to the case that a completed questionnaire can not be used at a motion at the same time .
moreover , new construction measures are not resistant .
Sch@@ in@@ dler stressed that the distribution of funding are stressed according to the &quot; Wind@@ bag concept &quot; functional - who first comes to ground .
you could no need to reserve any funding for later . &quot;
the project &quot; Ort@@ ner II &quot; has been shown to make the essential &quot; tasty &quot; project .
British inventor uses itself a micro@@ chip to come in order to come with a hand@@ movement in the house and car .
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so he enter his door@@ step , entered his office and even can start with a hand@@ ing movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had the tiny chip between Dau@@ ms and Po@@ ver@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .

the technology resembles a cats and dogs of the micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of North@@ am also wants to modify the castles in houses and cars such that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra cost of £ 300 a castle .

the promotional price of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the decision of the White House , a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that raises the American production in the last month , costs tax losses according to the military , which were up to the TIM@@ E Magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars .
the green white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , if the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and managing officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicop@@ ters in Connecticut became next to a Yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire @-@ fire car from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi .
the White House of the White House , demanded the presence of helicop@@ ters in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , after the helicopter of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , which is responsible for the operation of helicop@@ ters .
&quot; I just wanted to realize that you are aware of it , because there is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 on the eve of his lecture , the Deputy Commander for aviation .
the message was shown that the helicopter took place on July 17 at 7 p.m. in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock in the morning , until the lawn was taken between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
note that if the flight from the White House should be delayed by a second crew due to the restri@@ ction of service hours a second crew would be needed for the flight .
the original air@@ flow was found during the event during the helicopter , while security sper@@ son@@ al unit remained at the bottom during the plane during the plane .
out of the TIM@@ E available , we did not clear whether a second flight was needed .
the Brands Hatch is set to use federal property for political purposes .
record records show that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 would be asked if the event could resist the determination .
&quot; a question that we &apos;ve seen , whether it was about an injury of the Brands Hatch and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; sounds when you are closed , &quot; said the deputy commander .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was referred by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by Brands Hatch .
but also official events have political upper tones .
in the event , the President gave a violation of the reform of the healthcare reform , which was under@@ way in the Senate , and he acted the efforts to con@@ formity of the government legislation .
for use of air@@ crafts , which is known as Marine One or Air Force , it is hardly a new phenomenon from politically beneficial purposes .
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but its use only wanted to request only a photo @-@ OP , is unusual .
Tr@@ ump led to an investigation in February , when the presidential election before the backdrop of his first Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and its Twitter account is full of mel@@ ody for its predecessor - using its predecessor .
the White House is delighted by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy Press@@ ure of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 crew are often common training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn region around the US President in the White House with precise work@@ stations .
at the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 led to the White House 58 exercises .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was counted at the training requirement of the air@@ flow for the month , said a government .
helicopter @-@ units flew 11 hours to this day for &quot; non @-@ presidency support . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers must not be presented to any other re@@ pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokesman of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in com@@ mitting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 has no budget drawings for the Presi@@ dential flights , and it &apos;s difficult to determine the exact costs for the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ arians of the U.S. Department of Defense for the budget of 2017 the Do@@ D Group for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the flight as a 30 @-@ minute flight from the home of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argued that the actual cost of the helicop@@ ters are far behind this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for issu@@ ing sets , is highly irre@@ versi@@ bly , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; this estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs , which are included in the annual funding . &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the income set for Do@@ D was not the personnel expenses , but take into account the costs for fuel , maintenance and contract .
at this time , the former press pre@@ acher of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ing , gave the use of the helicop@@ ters for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week things to present in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ing .
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they can contribute to our national safety , and I go , that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on that . &quot;
and I think , as most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked unbe@@ ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is of course appropriate , the remarkable . &quot;
it was not clear whether tr@@ ump with the helicop@@ ters , when he set up a tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he set himself in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire @-@ level .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump on representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and sh@@ opper with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very good , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

as of September 1 , Krefeld , the City of Ess@@ enti@@ ves takes over to the local children &apos;s care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , the deputy head of the field of youth help , is a good news : &quot; we have delighted to look very pleased . &quot;

the city runs in the Kre@@ e@@ fields : 46 children &apos;s locations , in 44 get the children to the lunch time a warm meal .
last year , 800 children were sitting around the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
in the meantime , it is not only children , the 45 week@@ lies will be taken away in the K@@ ita , &quot; explains Pom@@ p@@ anz .
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour support if children up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
46 part @-@ time workers have served as service in the 1st September kitchen : you warm the s@@ late food supplement , add chicken , raw and fruit , por@@ tioned the meal , give food from rooms , rin@@ se , and clean the kitchen .

because of this , it &apos;s a healthy diet and cook@@ ery classes .
&quot; the children should help to prepare the food . &quot;
the direct connection of the chef &apos;s team is true .
also children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known strength in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar with them , and non @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - now also the task of the kitchen workers - will be done by special cleaning service in the future .
this variant , the separation of cleaning and kitchen services - has also provided the charm of the kitchen power in addition to the quality improvement in the city comparison between equity and foreign policy for the city as the most economic sector , is the name of the press office .

more than 500 employees work in the factory , which represents other products plan@@ no@@ bs and rich Tea cookies .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ in said he had invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added , he added that employees and trade union representatives , added if they would change their activities .
in a letter to the company &apos;s Fili@@ alle@@ gi@@ ites of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s &quot; concern , &quot; concerns the financing for moderni@@ zation of production lines do not be driven . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior organi@@ zer , Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win the general manager and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members .
generations have worked here and workers have strongly focused on the local community and the large @-@ area Glasgow , an important column for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social problems .

has the PS@@ G Barcelona three years ago before Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the page of La League your interest to Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti ber@@ eu@@ en
Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not allowed in their persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after they dis@@ appointed a offer of £ 189 million to dis@@ solve its free@@ wheel cl@@ ash , but did it warned Barcelona three years before the world record ?
the sensational approach to the summer season , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous mark , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United for the last season for 89 million pounds .
after the end , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the most affordable professional sport@@ sman in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is w@@ aged over the way and how Ne@@ ym@@ ar has its way to the outside of the Catalan , although a source close to the Catalan show that the club has always given its best to take care since his arrival in Santos in 2013 to take care of him .
but the football world was warned about three years ago from the PS@@ G President ?
as Manchester City 2014 the signing of the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ ui@@ di bek@@ und@@ ete , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for anyone who sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all clubs are all clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish association at the beginning of this summer interest at PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti prepared .
PS@@ G is clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to pay under any circumstances , and Barcelona could see the consequences of this interest by adding one of their price for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report de@@ comp@@ lies Pope @-@ brother George R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse of ab@@ duc@@ ed Pope @-@ brother George R@@ atz@@ inger .
the Author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report for the Miss@@ ing sc@@ andal can be sc@@ andal for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ nder , spokesperson of the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; stated after the German press agency , he acquired by the former Bishop Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would be the help of the Catholic Church , if Mu@@ eller and R@@ atz@@ inger would give you deep oppression over own sub@@ branches or their at that time to press the prec@@ au@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican City &quot; Os@@ servat@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , however , critic@@ ised the reporting of violence in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two sh@@ aker measure &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the over@@ lap in Regensburg , there would have to be pre@@ dict@@ ated and damaged during the future . however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian , and member of the national Italian bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; the usual , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion that it is true for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the stin Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n and Tax@@ is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the interview with the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would like to go to the Church and it &apos;s a fine fres@@ cos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they pointed out that in her youth &quot; beats a whole normal educational means &quot; had been &quot; to be filled with young children , as I was one , ready to be ready . &quot;
they believe it too , today &apos;s standards in previous decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about mis@@ use cases , Pope @-@ brother George R@@ atz@@ inger was often in connection with the reports .
totally un@@ right , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who was translated with R@@ atz@@ inger on the occasion &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take over George R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Ez@@ emann , &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; he says the results of the final report .
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station have been committed between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; with a high density , &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 panels for sexually mature .
in the final report , it &apos;s called to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; a summary , that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases of forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence were applied .
even with high emotional ality , the punishment was able to fall short of the students .
nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other accused appe@@ aled that many victims of the crimes against humanity is estimated and therefore , in many cases , despite violence , even positive memories were with him . &quot;
in the interview Ez@@ emann , why the final report of the final report for abuse of the burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger gave his mind for his opinion .
Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report about the &quot; inci@@ dents of violence against protection against the Rainbow Dom@@ sp@@ ice &quot; gives a conflic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
at that time , many students were out his &quot; Human@@ ity . &quot;
for the other he also appears as ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfection@@ ist , who was handy , even though a cathedral has no top performance .
how to make this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you have trouble and all the 440 pages long report from the front up to the rear , you have to ask , this is why the name of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is found therein .
only eight pages dedicated to him , and he will be clearly acqu@@ itted from any suspicion of the Middle East or fellow , and acqu@@ itted against the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the violence ex@@ z@@ est in the incident occurred outside of its sector .
you can hold it if , too late or first calls may not have taken seriously enough .
the school of gramm@@ ar school , at which he was involved , has been awarded by virtually all those surve@@ yed - &quot; salvation &quot; , &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
in this way , the vast majority of his disciples Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes him an excellent evidence , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; and &quot; comprehen@@ sible , &quot; as a very young teacher who guys regularly performed with cake , cookies and bon@@ bons . &quot; always of grapes used . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ain about his perfection@@ ism and its high emotional images that resulted in too long time .
that he was not only shared with chairs and the key Federation on the floor , but also ear@@ thly and too cute boys in the hair or ears , he had already been killed in the years ago , and deeply wor@@ shipped .
however , in his honorary membership , we must be said that such educ@@ ators were widespread in the freight time , the 1960s and 1970s , widespread in parents as teachers .
do you know even such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone from us who was born in 1968 .
I &apos;ve found the still in a world school , a state school .
compared to this report , what &apos;s actually in this report , namely , the pron@@ oun@@ ces of sexual abuse and the violence on the Vor@@ um , are the free b@@ at@@ ellen .
and ask , if it is not rather with his famous and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , many media has just passed away on him .
on the Bavarian Pope , many who have never been understood that never saved him .
but the truth is : the report sum@@ mon@@ ed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every sense !
in connection with the report , the report was reported to report a lot about the subject of abuse in the Rainbow Dom@@ sp@@ ice .
if Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is also used in the final report for any failure or competitor in terms of sexual abuse on sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
not only the 67 victims of sexual over@@ seeing claims to have familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never regre@@ ts , with my father and my mother , &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the other things that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was very special . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true problem with the information of sexual abuse was , however , it is that most of the victims from Sch@@ am .
if they don &apos;t even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then not a ch@@ oral manager , who had been the perpet@@ rators of a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Schüler R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in respect to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a frag@@ mented student stated that : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see no case , in which he had been able to claim ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and would have had to hold the perpet@@ rators .
I keep it ... also for really absurd to assume that this ... Bub@@ en in@@ sist@@ ently or more clear or even more , than against their parents , inter@@ nat@@ ants , confi@@ denti@@ als etc .
it speaks with him about sex speaks ... - lap . &quot;
this is the clear result of the clear result : &quot; that in advance by the most affected students and / or its environment , he could not be confirmed in the context of the study . &quot;
therefore , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore supported by any fellow @-@ commitment , so Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore supported by any fellow community .
so , it may not be accused of having to prevented him or to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to bring out his good name with these contradi@@ ct crime as it happened in some cases .
in the media it was a lot of &quot; violence ex@@ z@@ essen &quot; for the Rainbow Dom@@ sp@@ ice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of having &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
must live with this incident ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the great problem that in the reporting of the reporting of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was in the middle of it .
but this is exactly the abuse of a report .
there is clean as a result : between the pre@@ school and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ ice , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as we do once , other rest .
moreover , the inci@@ dents from the time since 1945 , thus also consists of four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral manager of the Dom@@ sp@@ ice .
the whole self @-@ ped@@ ago@@ gi@@ cs , the cases , in which Kn@@ es@@ cent of sa@@ w@@ k teachers , and painted , including de@@ filed , did all appear on the school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really have to do the Andalu@@ sian authorities .
but in them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister George R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do anything , because he got the boys only to face , when they had already been on the High School of gramm@@ ar school .
it was like the very witnesses to emphasize the subject &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
it was only happy to be come back and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; para@@ dig@@ itali@@ an &quot; states .
what was very different on the gramm@@ ar school of gramm@@ ar ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : as a result of discipline , but there was no sa@@ w@@ ed violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims of the general murder of R. took and therefore in many cases , despite violence , even positive memories of it . &quot;
so at the same time the case remains to have gone out .
however , despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods of periods in which it was reported by the listeners at the school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from the predecessors of a school at which he was not part and responsible , ( so the witness ) nothing wanted to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
lock Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in front of the listeners were consistently pursued the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the premises of the Dom@@ asi@@ um , the report of the report .
in it , he pointed out that , &quot; in the pre @-@ school , the testing will continue to be prac@@ tised . &quot;
already in view of the danger of negative press reports , he is urgent .
that was of course at a time , as a legal clarity , as a Prü@@ gel@@ es were banned in Bavaria .
earlier occurred in a legal grey area , like each of us probably still knows .
it was too hard to estimate that the people might ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the permitted border had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say it , he could have gone away .
this is true .
in 1980 , the testing penalty was officially abol@@ ished in schools in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Für@@ stin Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n and Tax@@ is said . yes , it is too cruel to apply today &apos;s educational standards at the time .
how to see the ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we speak about the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of the An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of last , past today &apos;s moral scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the princ@@ ess has been quite right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this , of course , of course not for sexual abuse , who was due to all times , and not for what was done in the school of resistance and violence against un@@ certain nur@@ tures , that goes far beyond that time beyond that time .
that &apos;s all very terrible and I am glad that it &apos;s finally opened .
but at the same time I must take George R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all that had nothing to do with him .
his funds for the prevention and punishment , so ear@@ thly and ears of the hair and ears , were widely used in the 1970s .
as physical punishment , then he was also strictly prohibited .
what is the image from his rain@@ bow at the time , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has given for the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ?
came the theme for testing and language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s going to be the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XV@@ I. , tells from his perspective , since then the Dom@@ sp@@ ice is only a tribut@@ ary .
however , I know that he led to a strict regim@@ ent there .
however , it must not be said to be said : without these perfection@@ ism , without having been wrong , it would be hardly possible that they had to go into national culture and his musical tradition which twice twice in the United States ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and bon@@ bons alone , one has come from rebel@@ li@@ ous boys now once a great singer and in every success , right to the field , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ winding .
as what &apos;s for a man , you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger on talks with their book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : because of work on the book and beyond , I &apos;ve met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really met again as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic set , deeply believ@@ ing and warm welcome people , from which you can &apos;t imagine that he could also do just a fly in a bit .
I get regularly with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ ice even today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly keep contact to him , he will be read , he is nearly blind and a member of their family .
those who did not forgive him until today , are therefore unique in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ ters are to be grat@@ eful to him today that he has en@@ riches her life and brought them the world of music .
and that he always have a good , fathers , good teacher , a str@@ close father , who may be his - but also a great resp@@ ect@@ ant , too , to whom they still look at today and honor it truly remarkable .
and please , even though , even quite clearly : all that you are acc@@ using him , educ@@ ators , that were at the time on the agenda .
