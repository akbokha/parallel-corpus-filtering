<seg id="6">It is nervous, if maps is not currently known.</seg>
<seg id="7">The knows everyone who had already had to be exciting, because the Auto-Navi instead of a reversal road showed a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, a wide range of Geoporteur as Bavaria, state government, are all other than currently - but just that is very busy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if they compares with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the towns and municipalities in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur has changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a Flickentepestry, which is not recognises as such as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the great map ticket, for cities and communities of more detailed cards, so-called Urfestivities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bayerische surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and the first surveying of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French Army occupied Germany since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wish to make an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bayerns in order - of course a military purposes.</seg>

<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV. asserted the project in particular, founded the" Topographic Bureau "" "" and thus the Bayerische publisher. "" "</seg>
<seg id="19">The priesthood for Munich dates back to 1856, and is like all other on the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison morning / today is on the example of the state capital at the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has extended into all directions and has grown to it.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is subsendling, which is still relatively isolated from the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was 21 years after creating the map, i.e. 1877, as the Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located right in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses are located in 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was named by Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers in Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you can't see nothing as a field - in the first sight: when the sign-out map with dutzing lines and numbers: handwritten notes from the so-called "Urgent," which was derived from the base tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small parcels is underlined there today no farmers more - but small gärtner of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>

<seg id="37">First place for 280 patients was first place, later was extended to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime, this capacity was not enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">There has been the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of the largest psychiatrist of Germany since 2006.</seg>

<seg id="50">Civil rights Group published travel for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of Farming has issued a warning for the colored politics and racial attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">The NAACP Travel Advisory Committee shall come into force by August 28, 2017 in force, because a number of fragmented by state of particular attention and external particular caution is to be able to happen, because a number of fragmented, deterioration-based events throughout the state of the state, and here will be noted, "it is said in the opinion of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent law by Missouri, which makes people heavier with discrimination, as well as the criminal authorities in the state of State, the disproportionon minorities are aiming to boost your destinations, the NAACP said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">You have the violations of the civil rights to happen people.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are put together because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we listen to complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that has issued the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group raised incidents as racial seeded against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">His differently, however, under fragmented circumstances in the beginning of the year, after, during the journey through the state no petrol had been taken into custody and by the police of Missouri, without a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also shows a recent report by the Office of the General Attorney-General of Missouri, in which black drivers can be more common in the state of 75 percent more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that humans are conscious and their families, friends and employees, what could happen in Missouri could happen," said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"the people must be ready to bring whether it bring into account or the relatives, that they may travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">In 2015, Missouri posted 100 Hasselt, according to the latest figures from Hasselt's crime programme, as well as in terms of the number of violations of the country's number of violations in the 16th.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel is also a reply to a new Missouri law that would make it difficult to give a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Before the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the American Civil Liberties (ACLU) had adopted amendments to the local enforcement agencies to disgrace people because of confidence, which is to contribute to the ACLU view.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel openings are generally issued by the State Department for other countries, but in the last time, stakeholders have the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends in the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weidezaunching project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidekin project is a successful project and continued to be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestag member Peter White and Kordula Kovac have turned on site a picture.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the jurisprudence of the Schwendemann, representatives of Fischerbacher CDU National Association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann, initially granted insights into its operation where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and equally many young cows and five apartments of holiday houses.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Schwarzwaldmilk" is for him of the alternative energy-market path for the milk of his cows, such as Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the holiday resorts only regionals comes exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since it is also the BLHV-president of Fishbach, he called the Weidezaunant project as "elementary ar."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not be used on so steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area of green space for a lot of work, much to be processed with the sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have found here with the conditions and topography with the topography," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he acquired the terrestrial operation and has acquired this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even though he does not lead to bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "the Commune, the importance of the Weidezaunching project is recognized and was joyful of the leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">At cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope that the forestorations of the surfaces could still be prevented a whole while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure in which we have, are the people who work in agriculture, and how they continue to bring out her operations," stressed the Mayor.</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often used due to support in the criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were used in the WeidezaunDevelopment Fund in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure area amounts to 40 hectares, which may not be adjusted to at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">The half of the total costs of 71 500 euros was funded by the total cost of 71 500, a quarter-district contributed the Municipality of Fishbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, farmers will love the farmers 12 610 Euro, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the Zäune," says Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac emphasised: "it does not make a right job, without farmers and land women do not go."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter Weiß: "here is best food produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The State Court Act (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of Weidefundus.</seg>
<seg id="92">The objective is the offended of Schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="93">The requirement is the presence of an evaluation of LPR's sponsors.</seg>
<seg id="94">Furthermore, the uncompromising area cannot be managed (hangar above 35 percent) and must be threatened by the request.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunching project 2018 currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open maintenance area is 35 hectares, the cold cost is of more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now, the White House of Trumbling the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime switch is it if they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate these equally as any other - hence the torate was staged at the fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trent regime, knew what he did, when he did a symbolic axe in a heat recitals with Jim Acosta by CNN about the proposals of the president for drastic limitation of the legal migration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller is not the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A hordes of boat shaded by boat and Liberty-Imitators have experienced him when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he also took of their significance, and in particular the importance that was attributed to her, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus, 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta complainable: "I don't want to go to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty has... an icon of American freedom, which is over the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to which, was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is consistent right, but as he told it, it does not really know about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It goes to the performance of the contemporary resonance of Lazarus, the only ones, in which a state does not only invite any other immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your poor, your poor, and your poor masses that are looking to breathe consciously, nor breathe consciously, / the elessly of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time, in which the "elect of trash" was better to see our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller is not committed in literary criticism - it made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural engagement: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends, who prepared themselves to place their words following her death at the base, did not know that she had been a high-political action by her death.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American-American Republicism by putting them in an abused classical picture the female Embodied Communication.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in its poem, the female figure is no more abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she himself is a very different name: mother of exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the dization with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And exactly how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people wanted to change the people from the right wing as long.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great write of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Baptist, argued that the Statue of Liberty was inserted, but rather an early neo-conservative, who bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is progressing.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the fackel of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The fackel is not the way to disconnect the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on a somewhat unusual.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and even a question of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great phantasievolle from Lazarus, they were to see how it was seen from the exhaustive, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips to the Decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the true sense that the world goes out of the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Your statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome you to hear them.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, do not recognize the perspective, the Miller and Trashi ever.</seg>
<seg id="127">Your fackel is not the way to break the way, but the hatred that is the only source of power is lit.</seg>
<seg id="128">World championship 2017: Neil Black Does Scottish members of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle is reminiscent of a time when there were only two carrots for the team of Britain.</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance Director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of the world champion "has a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"" "Black believes that" "" "in Scotland," "" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom have to learn something." ""</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue to continue until we find it out," said Black.</seg>
<seg id="134">"I say to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and think they think that there have something to do with what they did."</seg>
<seg id="135">Scottish athletes remember that it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And even with the type of street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of the circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals from medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butcher, who compete against Sir Mo Farah, while the Eiliie Doyle was elected to the team's team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is fairly modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her chapter's speech was incredibly, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, regardless of whether they were of gravel or, wherever they live, they went out of the room, and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and genuine feeling, the Eiliie were all of course, was great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner in which the fifth world champion in the 400-metre hurdle is said that it is "incredibly" that 16 carrots in the British team are.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the world championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle distance of Muir takes place on this path and has set up two European records in the past five years.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5.000 m Learn.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 square is running, is another shame that one should watch out the victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminiscent of its first world championships, when the only other Schotte appeared in the Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The capitalist Capitan said that she is "an enormously proud" on the fact that many of their compatriots not only belong to the team, but in some cases also with the medals and the finalists.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the exceptional team captain is to be found that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour, but to know that my team-mate was voted for me and voted for me," added it to something special for me. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"apparently I am very proud of all the carrots that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows just how far we come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athlete, athletes who want to rise to Powers.</seg>
<seg id="155">What would be my speech to be the captain in this?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy at this situation, since we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to set this exercise support and benefit from that we are back in the Olympic stadium.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go to go and compete, and it is simply as a great atmosphere since there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Block from critics over Facebook: Beetb don't get to a public office if you don't want to wear the voters of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country, knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans of George Washington, but it wasn't long until the newspapers took him because of all, from the Domestic Policy up to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He schimprated with the criticism, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">However, he has not brought his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">As in 1783, Washington said, "the Redeemer can be taken away - and, stupid, and silent, we become the sheep to the slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor of Larry Hogan, who has to work out to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and delete their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties union accused him therefore at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The staff of the governors left the lawsuit, and the online commentary was full of a reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it is a type of Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is no reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand at the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as the primary means to connect to his voters and play his hajobless head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blockage of people who come on the site's site - that is a public forum, which is officially called by employees who paid off with public tax dollar - unnecessary and finally dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governors and argued that the blocking of the comments was nothing more than a presentation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's easy to use the image of trouts or split or hassment people to use the Peits online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The Post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And that's just true people who speak with their chosen leaders - a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no troll.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all told that their comments respectful, clearly and not profiting.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor came to the Bible in his post and appeals to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney at Lakshmi Flanma Ramani von Bowie, MD., was not hassent, but she was asked to hate.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hasselt and other latest news," wrote in the commentary area of the news release "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I guess that idea is not even if a number of people on the same topic, they will be used by some more than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">Regarding the employee's staff, "concentrated spam attack," other likely would probably call "" "."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to remove a message, simply by simply define a critic or a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much clean than in a former time when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn, to burn or burn-to-burn or demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly what happened is digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials that criticises Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trent is accused by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter Feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in Virginia could last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County verlast the First Amendment, according to the U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when it served a voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt. in (R) also received a visit to ACLU because of its use by Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the moment of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect as the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers is related to his leadership between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter, overclocked his lead.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had an anonymous conspicuous.</seg>
<seg id="201">People who have pseudonyme like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Porcio" signed all letters of newspapers, Washington's decisions made.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, who have criticized its position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping of the United Kingdom to have passed over the historical documents that were collected by the online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not brought them to the silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Expression, differences of opinion and discourses are the basis of our nation.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly is actually doing.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If yes, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow on President trump, including the reports of the news media - in hope to hold the boss on a equivalent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"as John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, in his first working day with executive officers, he set up a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he repairing: bad information that took place in the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow, whether on paper or in letter, because the president would make better decisions, if he would be good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Ways diagnosis makes sense but others tried to sign an dump and monitor his media management.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship is sufficient for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, he is still heavily damaged in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if the candidate Trump was defiled, it was productive to show him that he was able to convince him a faire reporting of places, who were to convince him," said the former election campaign Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that "the key, trumps Twitter change will be under control, according to six former electoral-officials to ensure that his personal media configure includes a good lobbable prize."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that "trumps Twitter-habits is ever" under control, "is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these Kampagnenbeamers something that we do not know what we do not know that Trumps Tweets contain without their interventions, even more detects.</seg>

<seg id="1404">If his coworkers took it already some times a number of times, slew from him, then their efforts was worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has to prevent it out that lactic control causes.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people in a White House that brought out from competing parties, will always try to introduce their own agenda by adding trump material, which promotes their beliefs of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - quite with this story - reported in May about the preliminary adviser to the counsellor, President of Strategic and strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump-officials say that Trump can react rapidly to negative press lines, especially those with damaged Lecks, and that it takes you out to find out what these originate.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly what happened at the end of February when someone said to be a printed copy of an article by Got.com, the website of the Internet-provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy commander in Katie Walsh, "the source behind a heap of Lecks" at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson had been banned from Twitter on Twitter or that he has not offered a concrete evidence or that he had false allegations in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trent read the article and began to ask employees over Walsh. "</seg>

<seg id="1414">How did the folt?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tried three months later, the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he may prove himself as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still His impulsing self, and his advising is still on the impact.</seg>

<seg id="1480">In the Russia-affair, US President Donald Trump is supposed to have used a so-called Grand Jury in Robert Mueller after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">In recent weeks the panel I recorded work in the past weeks, the "Wall Street Journal" wrote under calling on one thing of confidential persons.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper evaluates the step as a sign that Mueller its investigates and intensified its investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The transmitter CNN reported it is the first invitations of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trumps oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us secret services accuse the Kremlin since longer, targeted to the presidential campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether it was conducted between Trumps election campaign and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigations into a focus of investigations should be several men who acted in the electoral campaign as a consultant of the Republicers.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to report, Mueller also took more and more trumps private and business environment among the magnifying.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The "Washington Post," wrote some weeks ago that the Special Scholler Trump personally presented himself in the center, and let down whether the president in the wake of the affair possibly the justice.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is it to examine, present in possible failure, and decide whether the indictment should be collected.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore called the anchor chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly, it is switched on when larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure will always be carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be switched from the public prosecutor to invite people to the presence of Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the transmitter, there were already pre-invitations that rotate the meeting between Donald TrumJr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons that were involved in the meeting were asked to be called to a statement, called the name of it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In addition, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides TrumJr. were also Trumps advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his damaging election campaign Paul Manafort at the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Right-wing experts said on Thursday evening on Thursday evening in the US television that the study showing that Mueller takes place in his work not bays, and that he should be necessary to act as soon as soon.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it does not inevitably indicate that the Grand Jury on the end is switched to decide on a charge of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the inauguration of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the owner of President Trump.</seg>

<seg id="1507">The former FBI leader James Comey had told three times that I will not be determined against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">We have no reason to assume that something has changed, the name of it was in the statement.</seg>

<seg id="1510">Because of this ramp, the accusations have gone against Trent, he used the justice.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before a Senate Committee, I was asked for a setting of investigation against the former security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>

<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate can be cut under the voltage and could be broken if there would like to interrupt a piece a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelaps and Eisberg increased the sea level, because they swim on the water and ice cream as much water, as it is after the melting it himself.</seg>

<seg id="1797">The lavender is a great conditions because of the droughts in drought, and because of the diseases are transmitted, scientists and farmers are trying to find solutions to find out great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effective because the plant was exposed to the impact of climate change, which in the spring has brought much rain in the spring and much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has impact on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small Zikade, a microbacterium, that transfers the Zwergzikades, and at very dry weather there is very many of them. "</seg>

<seg id="1802">Lavender oil loosen not only for holidaymakers, it is also very interested in perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of very long vegetable pipes with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, subdeveloped and weakened either.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">Among the solutions, which are considered, however, a better water distribution and deformation of evaporation of the soil, but also the result of the plants with a protective mixture of sound and water, and the development of varieties which are resistant to dryness resistance.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of an journalists emphasises the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly magazine Riodoce meet on Wednesdays to check out their plans for coverage of reporting on the youngest chaos in the state of Sinaloa through which organized crimes, corrupt officials and unaudited drug abuse.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, she came together to speak about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was notified to them that it is important to change their routine.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists will discuss what is safer: they are supposed to take their children with the office, which were in 2009 the goal of a attack with grenades, or they are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, Verbal.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporter for each column - no proof is necessary, percepzing and pancreas.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug addiggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to have suspected of the secret of the government or the card, a catalogue of breasts, who is dangerous to chaos.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no ruction of violence, and throughout the country, there are more journalists: at least 25 years since then President Enrique Pena Nieto has held its office since December 2012. 589 stand after attacks and threats of Bundesschutz und until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter, the publisher and its spiritator of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest error is to live in Mexico and journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence in connection with drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">His mouth is deeply worrying, although his presence is still present - a large photo of Valdez, with Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, T-Shirts, who show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and reporters about their shared subjects, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, Paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although it was built in 2010, a special event was established to process the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists just two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, which are associated with drug trading and organized crime, are the murderer of journalists just rarely found before court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In Riodoce they still exist that the violence of Sinaloa are still treat, although they are still untrunner and even though the terrain has now still missing.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without any information about the mortars, without righteousness, the meeting on the discussion of safety is little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very dumm, my time in this workshop," says he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the warum, we see all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He just managed to drive a few blocks away, before his red Toyota Corolla was removed from two men before his red Toyota Corolla was removed from his car and was shot down for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - that with "12th river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Schütze drove in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there are practically nothing as a silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in January and the extradition of the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the most powerful battlefields of the country, as rivalisisted cargo will fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It's nothing to be shot in Sinaloa every day, or a number of people on the road, or that the cemetery is full of destroyed, two-storey Mausoleen for drug abuse, which are bigger than many houses for the living life.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget to forget that there is a state of peace, "if only one cartel has the control of the coastal state, with its precious ports and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work was Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not use his friend's friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes, that two disparity to have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalents of antitrust in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">These publication may be the sons of Israel, the members of the issue bought each copy of the issue, as soon as they delivered to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistakes was in this case, Valdez did not hesitate to force after the complaint was published in the same story that the country had to leave the country to its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived that his friends and colleagues did so long that he would always be.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was working as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined together with five colleagues to the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US-Dollar shareholdings in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism, without on the noise ry problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time the newspaper served a reputation for the muetigen and honouring reporting, and the turnover and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it, hard-awaited investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication, where they could read stories that no one else has to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce it received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot prize" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage at the persecution of the Mexican drug history, where they always led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He voluntarily gave himself to he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue to live," he said to the CPJ award at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug order in Sinaloa, "a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento and TV.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you need to take over the task that falls as a journalist, either the or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what you have done in view of many dead... why did you have not told what happened?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team is Valdez, the fun-bird who could just like a harbour workers, who was a friend, generously with armaments and advice, a teacher who knew how to survived.</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always bear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always sit down to El Guayabo, the Bar on the office, and there are always seats at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now she ask: was his love to routine use?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also has forced to leave their own attack on the question about how they can do their work on the best.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"you like it, if you don't like to move with their female, their children, their own home, their native home and runways," to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," says Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-makers and self-maintaining.</seg>
<seg id="1865">His own Instinkers rely on.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it is false, keep it out of it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble, said the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, is that "smell a sense that can be shared... and then the thing is happening with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and other states, are not more - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a toxic mixture of lucrawrouters, weak institutions and corrupt officials at home is home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changed steadily.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room, where the employees met Riodoce to security training, suddenly no mobile phones allowed. days before, Spyware, who was sold exclusively to governments, is used to monitoring the monitoring of journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a building site.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce to protect the village of Riodoce in a mid-size range of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the shear, some of the reporter, whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who had the governor itself as a trusted rule.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago, since the reporter in the mountains have gone down, where the drug conveyors de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has stretched to three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an Exposé to the state expenditure, which focused on the home of the governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led to one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the State, an abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word that, who was abducted, or as it happened, so was careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favourite locally of drug addiction and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter found out of public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the registrations Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Several PRI-governors were accused of corruption due to high-profile cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write the incidents in this location, among them a son of "El Chakapo" Guzman, a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Just a few months beforehand the readers "column by Valdez, considered the best informed source on the abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "earlier," "" "previously said," "" "said: Villarreal, 46, with nickname" El FLACO "" "" because of its slender body statur. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1885">Now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken. "</seg>
<seg id="1886">The Valdez Office has been given to the storage room for signs and stickers, who protested against the Morde von journalists, because the employees have become something that they have never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">In a few words, Miriam Ramirez bred a few signs and went on to a demonstration on the next morning for an additional journalists to the office of the State.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared for three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western federal state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his point.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Throughout the country, journalists have become more involved in which they have written in organized protests "SOS Press" on walking paths and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On this day the director Bojorquez is going to Washington and tries to collect international support for the justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities, journalists journalists and they get to the truth because she said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has been asked about that it has been dealt by the government again because they worried about their objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeated that journalists in Mexico of organized crimes, participated in government officials and a valid society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, Narco journalism, "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drugs, but also on orders of politicians and security forces using the organized crime under a blanket.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Last year, the media group "Articulo 19" has over half of the attacks on journalists from the police and officials.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico, you'd like to find because she would like to make the mouth of the mouth" "" "Ramirez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously, Morde has obviously have a terrible effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one finds the death of the blogging Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipas before six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas-Kartell: "I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headset features in addition to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen as the newspaper El Norte in the northern boundary state of Chihuahua, after the assassination of correspondents Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do, as it did El Manana by Nuevo Laredo, after the assassination of their direct investment in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez was publicly accessible to the drug card with an article on the front page with the "What do you want to us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home country, or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It's hard to find out work in exile, and observe the roads and search for dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are stalled, as it was apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after the flight from Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who continue to stay and continue work, it is a daily dance with risk-sufficient decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Ibarra, the once poet his poet, announces that the drug stores it to him.</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and therefore I was reporter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="1912">At midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition was already finished, the editors of Riodoce began on the civil service and drank beer, when once all their phones began to mares.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shooting covered with bandrivals and security forces near the beach of Mazatlan, 19 confirmed dead dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued further, as it was promised by a number of antiell embassies in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">On the board side, they have released the news on the website of Riodoce about mobile.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page was to be changed on the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens are close proximity to - another piece of shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the police officers to see the guard, to see if they were in willingness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">If they were afraid, they did not show it.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose midfinger was visible for the Sinaloa, followed the employee of Riodoce his tracks.</seg>
<seg id="1921">"" "how can you do not remember that" "" "Bojorquez," "" "said on that same day, to which Javier was murdered, people asked to send us on the road to the road."</seg>

<seg id="1924">Researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nashorns of a Canadian mines so well received that experts were described as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so good that they could even find that his dragging skin of reddish brown was - and they said, she would have had anything from a "uncalm past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report in the magazine "Current Biology," called Dinosaurs, who was found ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs pieces of the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurians who lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His incredibly well-preserved condition, researchers, who describe it as "really remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the gepanzzed plant fresser is the best preserved Fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn funk, when he was born on 21 March 2011 at the Sunny Millenium Mine, near Fort McMurray, in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something, which seemed to be seen from the surrounding rocks on the Platze, and decided to take more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within 2,500 pounds (1,100 lbs) to be able to cover heavy animals within 2,500 pounds (1,100 lbs).</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all of this hard work, the finished result is ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you are only a little bit with the eyes, you could believe that it's slaughtered," said the main writer Caleb Brown, scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs specimens - Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this crop fresser, although he is covered with a armoured tanks, probably from meat and send dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The dinosaurs used dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide himself before smoking, and used a paragliding technology that is known as counteratting, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been allowed to blend its surroundings in its surroundings and to suit its enemy, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year old creature of the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and studied Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of a copy it allowed to document the Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the patterns and the form of shoes and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the consistency, a spread of the defense method in animal, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its base.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the result is common, the results are surprisingly, as the size of Borealopelta, the size of the Borealopta are far beyond the animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "" "" "" "" "the dinosaurs are believed that the dinosaurs are covered by a sufficient pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs that" "" "the evolution of the confrontation as a means of life." ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of contemporary animals that use the counter-lusioning - think of Rehe, zebra or belt - are much smaller and violate as prey, causing signalized that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strongly Raubtier behavior on a massive, powerful dinosaurs are showing how dangerous dinosaurs are to have been certain as dangerous dinosaurs." he said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scriptions also shows that the skin of the dinosauriers was red.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on evidence over his life, including his conserved Darminhaltes, to figure out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs is dead, when he died, in a river and to the sea, where he sunk on the back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At this time, Alberta was so warm as South florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much more land than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really interesting, because it is fully covered with serviced skin, but also in three dimensions, and the original form of the animal is retained," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal is almost as almost as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need a lot of imagination to construct it. if you are only a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is at bedtime. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk period was a time when huge Theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, who stood on two legs stood out on earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the gepanzzed dinosaurs was carried out by some of his furter ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This belongs to the Acrocanular osaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, their latest results in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was muddy after the death in the sea, and muddy in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creation was found by Shawn funk, when he was born on 21 March 2011 at the Sunny Millenium Mine, near Fort McMurray, in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the dominant Dinosaurs in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the schnauze until the hill.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creature was raised at an average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and have up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch-long tips that made by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the gepanzzed plant fresser is covered by Western Canada, until a flooded river, flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater trays of the dinosauriers protect his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The hidden remnants of this special specimen are so well received that the Hautreest still tasted tank panels along the dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko for National Geographic, is a such level of the preservation of such as' rarely, as a profit in the Lotto.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I see it, the confused, it gets.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Remains of the skin; still the holiness of tank may still carry on the skull of the animal's skull.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His rechter front foot is on his side, his five fingers crossed to the top.</seg>

<seg id="1997">Then, in the beginning of this year, there will be expected to be available on many further remote transport routes in Germany, "said a train-spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" "" "calls the ticket implementation without Schaffner." ""</seg>
<seg id="1999">To use this, however, some requirements must be fulfilled: one needs a smartphone or a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you must have booked an online ticket, which already do we do for most passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2001">You also have to bought it on the app of the Bahn, DB navigator, which is why the most comfortable type of the ticket price is.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And most recently, you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">For the "comfort Check-in" works such as: you take in the train, calls his ticket to "My Tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">During the test customers, a button will appear in the electronic resolution.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train station get a message on their mobile devices a message that the guest rooms is located in the train and the gebusidered seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Comes the train conductor at the ticket control system at number Y he knows that there is a Passagier with previously untreated Online-ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So, you can continue to pass further, continue straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn is to use the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you want to travel without a ticket control through our train personnel, I would like to try himself in the DB navigator.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This enables the passengers to design their travel time in the train of personal, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing-Board of DB Ferntraffic.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second Plus: "and our employees have more time than today to go to the individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who travels to train, knows that in addition to the late and missed trains of the ticket checks are among the largest sleeves.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often you have, in any case, however, one of the members of the members do not all documents that you need to pass the resolution of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either is the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document that you need to do.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The episode are endless discussions between migratory manager and the customer, which leads to bad mood in the firing or space and delays in the control of your own tickets and the Schaffner takes care of the time to take care of the needs.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And the ICE train is 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Further access to the same distance are not registered.</seg>
<seg id="2019">How an activist was to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken by her core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after they arrived in New York City, the St. Louis Geborene sat on the bed of a Airbnb apartment which rented for rent and scrollout by Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">You stumbled on a post of somebody from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still on the road," name was there.</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, since no one else had received the information on her Feed, she finished Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly reached on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The Rapper, in St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policemen in Ferguson, Mo., live on live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He postete a picture of Browns for blossom, which was stretched out on the road and would stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "this is wild" "", "Ferrell." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But the death was nothing new for them and their community nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She finished her phone as soon as you return on tweets on the Canfield-Drive in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were Photos from the police band and people who brought together, and by a man, who held the Father's Father, who brought him a sign with the inscription: "Fergusons police had just killed my inarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live scores, where a police force is a group of demonstrators with a bellishing dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, secured a other policeman, and cried: "I will kill you... Pets all kill you."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common" that Ferrell came to her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">"this is not the way of murder where we are accustomed to us, and that we could be able to know."</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt Schütt.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was waged and weeping. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">They booked a return flight and went on the next day after the house.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6-year old daughter from the house of her father, and decided that the two next morning to Ferguson would drive to Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas starting from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of life and the protest, the love and the losses, the strength and the resistance force, which is out of the perspective of people living in the community and the streets are filled to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell gave her daughter with her daughter, which wearing a flower-dress and a matching crown, after Ferguson, speaking the two conversation, which she had countless years before this morning, "over the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you don't know you how I taught you, when the black people must fight for the fight, what they believe that they believe?" she recalled what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we now go to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not correct.</seg>
<seg id="2045">I did not take it, "said Ferrell later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happened today is, is a highlight of the... what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You have to know it and be viewed in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activity and organisation, but also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution, and what we need to do to liberate ourselves to liberate ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I have good fortune to give you an experience, where they don't have an eklatism, it is not otherwise known as the next black women-child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel the feeling, I would give you a poor service to keep them away. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, situated on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authorities, considered the activists of the potential non-indictment by Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There is Ferrell and her daughter with local business owners where lunch made.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets before and halted them on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly started a new kind of activism for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">After August 9, totally changes, "she said," said she and noticed that she was focused as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on Essens-justice and health imbalances in black communes.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I did not experience any experience in the organs.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Everything has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met the Sabaah Folayan evening, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to only document "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came from Ferrell to the meaning: "want to document their document or trying to find a story that can you use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepsis was nourished by countless cases of people, often of White, in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently declared in an interview: "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up, and raised their voices, and we wanted to make it different."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, a artists from the area that is known for his activism or Todestract occupants.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement, Ferrell brought the project closer together with six other locals and the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or with us. we speak," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "this was the main thing for me how these people are represented, for as I will be represented." ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The objective was not to concentrate on Ferrells experience - to show that it comes to the movement "not by the Messiah leader," but by a community, "said Folayan - she proved to be the most important participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells lives as she loves and married to her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and leighth said when they saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "but" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells repeats the role of black sponge women in the wider Black-Lives movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement that followed after the killings of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, the film "BlacklivesMatter" have been instrumental in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, pregnant women in managerial positions held the movement in total," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are fighting on different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, pregnant women must have to carry the main load of all. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan voted to notice that "the movement is really held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is however, however, that "this is not a wiver type of action," in the Ferrell has been selected as a heart of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person struggling in this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it's no coincidence, although she was in front of the front, because of life on these crossings as a black, pregnant women as much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can see their energy by the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">In the meantime, the news agencies have long been gone in Ferguson, but the racial connections between the church and the police exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on the currency for 2 ½ years due to blockage of the highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless, she danced to a singing and feel at that memory, since she has lived in Ferguson on the street three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our mandatory to fight for our freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our mandatory to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love each other and support.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" up to "magnitude": TV readers "discuss the bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, although it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping center on the Süver of the pedestrian zone has been obsolete since the first presentation of 2009 the population in observing and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold is hardly any cold on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" on our Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="2093">While one of the bit gallery says: "this would be a dream (" Anja Becker) or "The would be real class" (Siggi Bages) or simply by simply: "magnitude!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocates to ensure that a gallery will benefit more customers in the city, of which the remaining stores will benefit, will fear the opponents that the pedestrian zone has become a bloodstream.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Added: the gallery is set up exactly on the premises in which the peasantry is available, in the 13 high-market products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Galerie Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - namely the Beda Square, to the outside of seats.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we buy one week for many years now in the peasantry hall." ""</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cake of the land of land is still very happy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish us that, and above all, after the construction of the gallery, we would have a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities, there are also the same.</seg>
<seg id="2103">The small exhibition hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing, "if you are direct from the market in a brand hall in the gallery, coming on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The should probably be too low too low. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "to do the shopping Palace in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, dropping or supermarkets: I find the superfluous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many shop stores here are empty - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But there is not even a regular weekly market here, the more important that will be at least the market hall remains at least.</seg>
<seg id="2111">For anyway, the commodity has been freshly made, most of which is offered directly from producers and is also reasonably priced.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you see, Ladin stores will be rented in a shopping mall only of larger companies, because there are no retailer for a retailer often.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, there is almost no more and that, which is still left, will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a mall with a brand hall fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where is the peasmarkthalle during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even on duration when the bit gallery is actually sometime actually.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or it creates the bit-bit gallery already, all business from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this is simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center, the empty is still no one needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">I have been better to promote a real peasant market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant markthalle, it has no place thanks to the wrench. many - as I find - sensually construction projects in Bitburg no space anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">If the peasantry is capsulated, it will disappear again a piece of culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the smokers of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are seen - white, black and brown that are almost unstrange equal - that are caused by the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, from the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, which have been sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from prison in Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analyst at the former diplomatic relations after they made public relations with the site of WikiLeaks over the site of the WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, A Becoming Resemblance (An matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey and Hagborg, whose discipline was transformed into technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a cross-woman who had been converted to Barack Obama, as he had only three days in his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg was created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which could look like someone with these genomic data, could not only be interpreted to the fortification of DNA data - which can be interpreted as they can be interpreted as well as the inherent detection of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning who was born as Bradley Edward was born in 2013, but has already been condemned as a woman as a woman in 2013, including six crimes against the spy law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Due to the prison, her picture was suppressed, so there was only a single picture - a liqueworthy, black-white Selfie, in the man's clearly visible on a driver's seat and has been associated with platinum-platine perish.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of their 2012-project 'strand Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist portraits of foreign workers produced from forte Artefacts as cigarettes and chewing gum by removing the DNA from waste, to produce a picture of it, such as those people would look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time at that time was an e-mail by an newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">A interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article "explained Dewey-Hagborg during a press show.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at this time and she could not go photographed, so they took out contact with Chelsea and asked them whether they wanted a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">In the course of two years, the artist and its incarcerated Muse were trained to exchange several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They created a shooting of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic book "support images" which saw a future foreseen in which the president of Chelcias would convert and immigrate to the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Mannings was asking for seven most violent years in Kansas City, was a welcome kind of happy reunion.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There are also at the opening of the exhibition somewhat deep and starkes, because Donald Trump leads a war against informant from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, a straight-enabled ways to fix the rigid spares, which actually should be solved, further to unspoiled.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg after the strange Timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>

<seg id="2144">The opposite wall is the mitochondrial DNA sequence - an thousandfeed of Cs and Gs and As, in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg was hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nuclotide after the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist) as amazing, at least in biological regard we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people are going to take that our genome does not mean that we are, and how are genetic data for a interpretation and as subjectively they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories, too.</seg>
<seg id="2147">The "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition that is kept in an own space, is a page from the above mentioned comic Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, as they have written with a acquittelefon in the hand from the disciplinary control of the United States as King-Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they make your speech your speech, then she won," said it. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">So, the mouth never goes to the mouth. "</seg>

<seg id="2211">They now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for the persecution of their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company? "said Jim Barnice, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools has been used to measure employees.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel up in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap polls and surveys from certain teams, there is a heat-card of the company that shows most of the complaints, and what managers have their questions, and what managers have low order results - so you can go back, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies are coming to, in order to remain at the top of the workplace culture, so that a former employee has been published in Skandale, who has been published a blog post since then, who describes an environment of Belorations in which those who have spoken, were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this wish is an overview of lucrative business possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The Global Governance, Regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118,7 billion value, according to the financial technical website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convert, the company helps to prevent bad behavior, saw a rising interest and activity in the beginning of this year, in the middle of the uber Feverything in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has almost 600 clients, including airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like Glint, Convert can send a custom "Puls-" surveys, trusted answers in real-time and the heat-maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous release of an SMS hotline, with the employees of bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main business is included, complaints directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the Court of public Opinion about the regulations" council, "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convert.</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that his employees will have treated bad or itself inethically, it may experience precious consequences through consumers - Boykott, workers - Flutuation and Klagen, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, convercent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and process, and a simple way to achieve its corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier when an employee was wanted to notify, he had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the corporate headquarters, a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a limitation and unfeme experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said, there was no good opportunity to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Well, as the company converticent can help problems that were in offices in cities or states, hidden in offices in cities or states, hidden - such as discrimination, bellows or unlatures internship are identified, identified, in offices in cities or states.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can closer to this holistic, 360-degree visibility in the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who runs the risk management Group of Ruby on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders before employment."</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies started in ethics, ethics, values and employees of commitment to 2002, after the accounting company Arthur Andersen said, Quinlan said that Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took it until the "socials of media came to her right," that companies did not prevent that you could not prevent their dirty lingers online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before the use of Technology on the surveillance of ethics, people used as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convert offer your software as a service provider, and the company with recurring fees for use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the agreement of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the whole capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzing took home to $10 million in November of Bessemer Partner, and brought his total financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">This investment is hardly surprisingly, in view of the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex in research, which shows that today's staff are expected to expect more than so far.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high salaries and interesting projects only.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The staff want to feel that you are accepted and estimated that you will be able to give your time a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to work in a company that will keep her vote, and that her work has also been committed to make this company," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience in LinkedIn that are both Convert as well as Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach Rendites in return if their portfolio will run good. companies are running well, when workers are engaged and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the Analytics Tools Division is third promise to raise commitment and use of employees, it's no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data regarding the experts of the workplace culture is important for the experts of the workplace culture.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless when the caretching of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks employees after your feedback, it can be a anticipation that changing the way is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come quickly enough, or at all, this disappointment can shuts and employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 calls, you must have ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting in the Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen the company to have left information on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"if you are not to follow," Do you ask, "Have you heard me?</seg>
<seg id="2251">Take care of this?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And if you do not take care of it, why should I mean? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who is now able to enter into action on the same day, if a problem was reported on the same day, if a problem is reported on Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2254">In accordance with the feedback of frustrated employees, it was possible through the speed of decision making decision and quality of communication, to add several teams within the company and to add a communication training to add the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">In Ruby Tuesday, the company receives new insights into the staff, and hopes to hopes for a long time of view, which leads to a better quality of workers in the industry, is well known for high sales.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you'll lose the people," said Vitrano.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"and if you lose people, you lose customers.</seg>
<seg id="2258">And if you lose customers, then you will lose companies.</seg>

<seg id="2274">Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel as of this weekend, but Mora made a problem that there could be a problem, as soon as these rooms are free during the season.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"we will use our safety," said Mora.</seg>
<seg id="2276">"this is a real problem, and it's not far away to think that the people rent there a room and then set there to set up a exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2277">If you have the videoband of a exercise, it is a pretty good shop.</seg>
<seg id="2278">But we have visited security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel about a comic novel, a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video at a squeeze for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-he and 1980-3 years.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years in a turbulent history of his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphical novel of Jamie Rhodes, a moped Yorkshireone with a love for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look on the manuscript by somebody which has been dead for 300 years," says he says weaken.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what to keep a personal relationship with this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'a Castle in England's slows the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families appearing in Scotney. every story was illustrated by another British artist together - Isaac Kraley, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on a archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he found unexpectedly.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only reacted on the thumb pressure on the side of a letter in the 1700's, he was written for the Jakobiner," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And sent letters to smoke, since then, one fire was fected because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For anyone who lives 300 years later, the smell has a effect when he would be too.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Dear, oh, ich Archive! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For anyone who run with old papers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council in England, and nearly four months in a castle lived ("To be honest: I have always rated a little bit") it seems to be beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days in order to explore the archives and the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, as about the monogrammed buttons on walls and the bottles, the centuries had spent in Graben.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He emigrated through the area and the ruins of the old castle, and said with Landing spans, garnered and sometimes also worked with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night, drank "Whiskey and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust was only published in 2006, when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">As Rhodes one decade later, the employees had just started to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years ago, in which Aristokt said," Oh, wirf it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Tagebra, letters from the time of the English Empires, maps that they would like that land-conflicts would like to be boring, "says Rhodes," but there was a peke to have two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let's go all his course! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the castle rebuilt in order to join the farmhouse of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"" "there is a recording of a listing, the 1380 castle in the castle, in this book entitled" Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex "" "" says Rhodes. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasantry began in this area and I thought, an uprising was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are connected with each other? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are fixed in the history of the castle, like 'The Priest', who told the history of the Jesuit priest, which grew seven years during the English reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', presented in the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th Century who filled his own burial with stones (a discovery that was only made years later than his Sarg was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "the men seemed to be hithered Gauner, and again, and spend the money for things that they couldn't know.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell-men's men they marries their schooling, by having rich old women - I found myself as a bunch of well-looking guys who were with a talent to destroy a landlocked. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of its use in the castle, Rhodes is in the search for another unique write experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has a two weeks stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämen, behind the site of a sanatorium in the early 20th century, which was back to the nature of nature.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney made a special place for him.</seg>
<seg id="2321">"I was sad, back again," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2322">It was like: "oh, now I must be finished with the dams life."</seg>
<seg id="2323">Campaign started: over 300 years old Mary-chapel in Rhöndorf.</seg>
<seg id="2324">With the hilation of the 301-year-old Mary-chapel in Rhöndorf, the town Bad Honnef launched her campaign to launch a new umbrella brand (round Rundschau Thursday).</seg>
<seg id="2325">Even until Thursday, Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team fell by Nelson Artz, the logo and the slogan.</seg>
<seg id="2326">By the end of August, it should be the climax of the campaign as a feast on the island of Grafenwerth.</seg>
<seg id="2327">"" "nice for us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2328">Or?, "ask the makers of action since yesterday at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="2329">"we think that (of course!) do not really," write it up on her last unlocked website.</seg>
<seg id="2330">"we use this measure to win your attention.</seg>
<seg id="2331">And to make it clear that manches is better than it seems.</seg>
<seg id="2332">Basically, we are the firm conviction that we are known as Bad Honnefer to know the beauty and attractiveness of our city. "</seg>
<seg id="2333">With the action let it be more than "a logo and a slogan, it's more.</seg>
<seg id="2334">"it is true, a single promise to formulate, one that the city is a distinctive unique feature."</seg>
<seg id="2335">Finally, it was in competition with other local communities.</seg>
<seg id="2336">The City of Bad Honnef can make their new roof brand and the campaign cost.</seg>
<seg id="2337">Military reforms in Turkey - Earth's fear of the army</seg>
<seg id="2338">Every year at the beginning of August, Ankara participated in Ankara the Supreme Military Council (Yas) over Pensionings and findings in the army corps.</seg>

<seg id="2343">Under the leadership of the government, the government leaders now also took the five prime minister, as well as the Minister for Defence, Home Affairs, and Foreign Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Thus they were civilians in the Yas in the overseas.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government attracts the trains in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">General of Staff Hulusi Akar has remained in the office but the commander of the Heeres, the Air Forces and the Marine have been sold.</seg>

<seg id="2349">Against 486 people, who have been involved in the coup attempt, have been involved in Ankara in this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the overthrow of "God," because he give him the opportunity to clean the armed forces. "</seg>
<seg id="2351">But the Erdogan really had the army really in the grip?</seg>
<seg id="2352">In late February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unrest in the military headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the general scale it will give birth to a growing "Islamic" of the army, among other things, among other things, among others, wrote in the revocation of the head of military personnel, "wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The large-scale plant in the army and the security forces continues anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In the middle of July, Erdogan updated another 7395 state aid, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In fact, it seemed to be Erdogan's military to the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">Generals were former in the country as the actual men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">She had three times a putative on appeal to their role as a guard of the world state aid.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan of the military leaders returned to step by step, not least on appeal to the reform of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say, Erdogan divulbe targeted a Islamalization of armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the magazine "Vocal Europe" in particular, not so-called officer who sought after the coup attempt on fears of persecution in foreign countries, the Turkish army would be in few years "full extremists and Salafists."</seg>
<seg id="2362">This is true, such development could not be cold in NATO.</seg>
<seg id="2363">In the Alliance, there are doubts in the Alliance after the purge of doubt about the Turkish army.</seg>
<seg id="2364">The leadership of leadership and operational abilities are "weakened" by NATO diplomats.</seg>

<seg id="2376">To ensure the future of the race shuttles-long term, according to the traffic Ministry of Agriculture in this year's construction work on the track.</seg>
<seg id="2377">With the decision to order the Ilmenau-Rennstig track, the country plan to order to order this, especially for tourism in particular, "says VerkehrsState Secretary Klaus Sühl, on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>

<seg id="2379">From this sum, the country is 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, based on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country, will be present at the present time, explained Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2381">The Ministry and the Südthüringen District as well as the operator are already agreed upon the technical details.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The ascent of sex robot is real, and we should make us worried about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that it can not be crazy about 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the range of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently published the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Stiftung responsible for responsible robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, a professor of robotics and artificial intelligence on the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their ascent.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, select its form of chest and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"the people do have fun, but the company provide a lot of lot of it, and we'll get much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey in the release of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon wretina, which warm warm - with respect to human reactions, which can be achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also be able to adjust its robot's robot "and select everything from the eye of the robot over the form of the robot up to type or the color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it is still unquieter, as many robots could possess the "personalities," which would look for a Stepford's Woman.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed to robotics with a silicon wretina.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot enables users to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties, which they are responsive as for example.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the True-called Roxxxy Gold Sex robot with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of attacks and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality who has been adapted to your personality as well as possible," says the website of True Toon.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So you may like what you like, and they may not like what you do not like etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">It has, in the course of the day, your mood - quite like true people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">You can't be tired, fixed at Conversation, or it can be "in mood."</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many beaded aspects on this rise of sex robot - but not least because they replace real human relations - but the submitting female features, when you get a step on Frigid (means here: streak) Farrah, beunquiet one at most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website, True Toon Roxxxy with a Vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can men do not have Roxxxy?" it is on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a Fetish or, just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing refinery on some darker and peale it in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of equality of the genders to a desire to sex with submitting as optional.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men are of course no sex robot, and during the FRR, they still remain equal popularity on the edge of the consumer culture.</seg>

<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or bellied by them the free market until they use the free market.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There are some surprise that these highly developed sex robots in a period of time, in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which the White House gives an president that attested to women sexually mature.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most terrible aspect of the TV series' The Hands' s Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images that devour bodies and the ausoches eyes, but as realistically this vision acts.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment, this doesn't feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The objective behind these sex robot is to make a physical similarity to actual women as technically as technically possible (even with Pornostar Proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builder want to feel, that they feel human being, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, in the point when it goes to their "personalities," the robot is no real women.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Trumps great power?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney for the concept of healthy human rights</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a Binsenweisheit of the trump era that the political spares, which have polarized by the U.S. electorate, even families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Ernest was held in the USA, with advice on how to use the horror of trump-seling relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We rigorous to all of the blings to let our filtering bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power trumps, families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mentioned this because my cousin, a centre-oriented Dichterin, who lives in Chicago lives and has long been visited by the Republics in our family, me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a mighty effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With trump in the White House, everyone who knows it, including the republican association, with which she had fought decades because of the policy, suddenly and quite suddenly on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to make the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it falls in a further context that this is significant risk of risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the effect of his presidency took the force to move us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "if we speak of" normalization "and lactation, we refer to the gruselly possibility that us are no longer cast out of one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is still a long-term scenario, in which the ring Republicans of the right wing "normalized," which appears to appear on once in comparison to its standards suddenly as an officer of interrogation.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find me now from an active Nostalgia for Mitt Romney's official version of the offence - the 14% income tax (but at least, we did not know how his tax statement) - the both in comparison to Trump in fact is a very mild criminal.</seg>

<seg id="2439">When my cousin came to the city, we brought our children to Karussell in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York Parkdivision, and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city when one needs no caffeine.</seg>

<seg id="2443">However, Central Park-Karussell is still a strange experience as there is two two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-he years and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I have made the Karussell on this site, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one has asked about this.</seg>

<seg id="2490">Software update for diesel cars: what the people now have to know</seg>
<seg id="2491">How accurate we find the software update?</seg>
<seg id="2492">To participate diesel driver to the action?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers in the overview.</seg>
<seg id="2494">The diesel has offered BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW-Group software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars.</seg>
<seg id="2495">They are to improve the exhaust-behavior of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and partly in Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4-Diesel or bad are except of them.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanine of the ACE of Auto Club Europe are invaluable:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new promotion is obligatory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">No, the selected software updates are voluntarily surrendered.</seg>
<seg id="2500">"the obligatory updates will only apply for the vehicles, the Schumann software," says Anja Smetanine.</seg>
<seg id="2501">Their disarmament has ordered the drive-drive (KBA).</seg>
<seg id="2502">How, and when when, customer informs about updates?</seg>
<seg id="2503">The manufacturer have announced an outstanding implementation in the next few months, but no exact date is called.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Daimler has informed us every person.</seg>
<seg id="2505">When the inspection is due to a inspection, that will be done in their framework.</seg>
<seg id="2506">How long will meet the upgrading machines?</seg>
<seg id="2507">"difficult to say," says Smetanine.</seg>
<seg id="2508">The curtains of the commitment of the manufacturer, as well as of political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"for we have seen, the author of the author are currently working on the environment at the environment."</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long should last update?</seg>
<seg id="2511">The upgrade itself could last only three to four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Time consuming, it could be possible to get an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2513">What do drivers do not make a car by BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?</seg>
<seg id="2514">ACE of the ACE for finish.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Presumably, foreign manufacturers would follow, so Smetanine.</seg>
<seg id="2516">There is a massive price fall of Euro-4 cars?</seg>
<seg id="2517">The ACE fears this.</seg>
<seg id="2518">But in the regions, where riders are droves.</seg>

<seg id="2539">He reports from varied, but also challenging tasks that wait for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is admired that so far no application to meet the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for the next time an architect and engineer.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So - at that point of regular termination, it should be enough time for a work.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach has been a judicial authorities for the Board of Administrative Authority and does not need to answer the application process.</seg>
<seg id="2544">For this function will keep the city to every case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Would they do not fill out this, would have to drive the citizens up to Offenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the neighbourhood of the city and him also important, Wacker who reports from a good operating climate, and good mood between the authority and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="2547">In more than 30 years in the office, some important projects have accumulated, looking back to the chacker with pride.</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city life" "" "he is safe for the building office and its employees." ""</seg>

<seg id="2551">The latter is the latter - with around 1.5 million euros in the book alone, "if we make it right," estimates Wacker.</seg>

<seg id="2556">"you can move too much," so Wacker, and the design of the green spaces will be affected by citizens and visitors.</seg>
<seg id="2557">Since the old town as an ensemble, under monument protection, it is important to have, "an eye to do," if newbuildings will be approved, emphasised by the scheid city master.</seg>
<seg id="2558">The Stadtbaumeister is high responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">He is builder, "at the end it runs all about my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">At the time of care and coordination, he can count on long-standing staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been working for the past ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) has been working for the past 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">Also, that his successor remains a long time, Wacker: "we are looking for someone who really want to be identified with the place really identified and remain."</seg>
<seg id="2562">Because continuity is not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">Those who wants Roland Wacker, would like to provide information about the city of Haslach, as a diploma-engineer or Bachelor with specialist device architecture and have good professional knowledge in the areas of construction and building planned.</seg>

<seg id="2578">Isolators and Masten were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Rotate meat, dairy products and chocolate could help the IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) to linders</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claimed the opposite: a diet that rich in meat-based protein and milk products, the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases could occur.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States, affects approximately 1.3 million and caused a stomach, recurrent or bluffs, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the people usually offer, meat and dairy products, researchers found that researchers at the Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of protein used to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immune cells in the intestine was patrol to ensure that harmful microben that hide himself in the food, not in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are impregnation of inflammation, inflammation of the cells are balanced to protect the tolerance and protect the body, without sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When the balance is widely used in the direction of inflammation, it can result a inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experimental, it was found that a species of tolerance immune cell in mice found that a particular bacterium in its inserts.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins and the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a normal portion of the intestine-microbioms, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan could be mice in their food, the more had them made from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and an tryptophan rich diet tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal functions, if the same system also promotes people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan looked at the tolerance of tolerance, as they found out that a group of study groups had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that was separated from the same thing that was not separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It is believed that the difference with the intestinal microbial of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, who normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of the mice were detected and have been found six species of bacteria that were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were detected in a sterilised environment, so that they were recorded in a microbiom, and they were not developed in the immune cells, and they received L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria could grow on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri, in a liquid grow, then that small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - were isolated from the mice that were isolated from mice by mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component of the liquid is cleaned, it proved to be a tributary of the tryptophan metabolism, which is known as Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers have doubled the amount of such as tryptophan in the feed of mice increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan values are halved, the number of cells fell by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri are protected in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known to whether tryptophan-products from L. reuteri, such as mice, but defective in Gens in relation to tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "the development of these cells is likely that we want to promote inflammation in the inner surface of the Darms.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, if the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and managing officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.</seg>

<seg id="2722">Note that if the flight from the White House should be delayed by a second crew due to the restriction of service hours a second crew would be needed for the flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original airflow was found during the event during the helicopter, while security spersonal unit remained at the bottom during the plane during the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Out of the TIME available, we did not clear whether a second flight was needed.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Brands Hatch is set to use federal property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Record records show that HMx-1 would be asked if the event could resist the determination.</seg>

<seg id="2728">"sounds when you are closed," said the deputy commander.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was referred by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by Brands Hatch.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political upper tones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">In the event, the President gave a violation of the reform of the healthcare reform, which was underway in the Senate, and he acted the efforts to conformity of the government legislation.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report decomplies Pope-brother George Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of abduced Pope-brother George Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">The Author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for the Missing scandal can be scandal for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesperson of the reform movement "We are church," stated after the German press agency, he acquired by the former Bishop Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be the help of the Catholic Church, if Mueller and Ratzinger would give you deep oppression over own subbranches or their at that time to press the precautions.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican City" Osservatore Romano "" "", however, criticised the reporting of violence in the "" "" two shaker measure "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the overlap in Regensburg, there would have to be predictated and damaged during the future. however, the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian, and member of the national Italian bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the usual, the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion that it is true for normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "the stin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said:" "" "in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk" "" "we would like to go to the Church and it's a fine frescos." ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">In addition, they pointed out that in her youth "beats a whole normal educational means" had been "to be filled with young children, as I was one, ready to be ready."</seg>
<seg id="2899">They believe it too, today's standards in previous decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about misuse cases, Pope-brother George Ratzinger was often in connection with the reports.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Totally unright, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who was translated with Ratzinger on the occasion "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "I have to take over George Ratzinger in protection," says Ezemann, "for all that had nothing to do with him," he says the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report, which was presented by the diocese Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen station have been committed between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, "with a high density," victims of overprint, 67 panels for sexually mature.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it's called to Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "a summary, that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases of forms of physical and psychic violence were applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Even with high emotional ality, the punishment was able to fall short of the students.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other accused appealed that many victims of the crimes against humanity is estimated and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even positive memories were with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Ezemann, why the final report of the final report for abuse of the burger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger gave his mind for his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report about the "incidents of violence against protection against the Rainbow Domspice" gives a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">At that time, many students were out his "Humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">For the other he also appears as choleriker and perfectionist, who was handy, even though a cathedral has no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How to make this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you have trouble and all the 440 pages long report from the front up to the rear, you have to ask, this is why the name of Georg Ratzinger is found therein.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Only eight pages dedicated to him, and he will be clearly acquitted from any suspicion of the Middle East or fellow, and acquitted against the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violence exzest in the incident occurred outside of its sector.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can hold it if, too late or first calls may not have taken seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The school of grammar school, at which he was involved, has been awarded by virtually all those surveyed - "salvation", "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">In this way, the vast majority of his disciples Georg Ratzinger describes him an excellent evidence, "" competent, "and" comprehensible, "as a very young teacher who guys regularly performed with cake, cookies and bonbons." always of grapes used. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complain about his perfectionism and its high emotional images that resulted in too long time.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he was not only shared with chairs and the key Federation on the floor, but also earthly and too cute boys in the hair or ears, he had already been killed in the years ago, and deeply worshipped.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, in his honorary membership, we must be said that such educators were widespread in the freight time, the 1960s and 1970s, widespread in parents as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know even such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone from us who was born in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I've found the still in a world school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to this report, what's actually in this report, namely, the pronounces of sexual abuse and the violence on the Vorum, are the free batellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">And ask, if it is not rather with his famous and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, many media has just passed away on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian Pope, many who have never been understood that never saved him.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report summoned Georg Ratzinger in every sense!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report, the report was reported to report a lot about the subject of abuse in the Rainbow Domspice.</seg>
<seg id="2930">If Georg Ratzinger is also used in the final report for any failure or competitor in terms of sexual abuse on sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not only the 67 victims of sexual overseeing claims to have familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">The parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "I never regrets, with my father and my mother," said: "" "" said: "" "" said, "" "" for the other things that "" "" I was very special. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem with the information of sexual abuse was, however, it is that most of the victims from Scham.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they don't even parents and siblings, then not a choral manager, who had been the perpetrators of a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-Schüler Ratzinger's role in respect to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a fragmented student stated that: "regarding sexual abuse... I see no case, in which he had been able to claim (Georg Ratzinger) and would have had to hold the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I keep it... also for really absurd to assume that this... Buben insistently or more clear or even more, than against their parents, internatants, confidentials etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">It speaks with him about sex speaks... - lap. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">This is the clear result of the clear result: "that in advance by the most affected students and / or its environment, he could not be confirmed in the context of the study."</seg>
<seg id="2942">Therefore, Georg Ratzinger is therefore supported by any fellow-commitment, so Georg Ratzinger is therefore supported by any fellow community.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So, it may not be accused of having to prevented him or to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to bring out his good name with these contradict crime as it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media it was a lot of "violence exzessen" for the Rainbow Domspice.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of having" "" "by the former Domkapellmeister." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must live with this incident?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the great problem that in the reporting of the reporting of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger was in the middle of it.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly the abuse of a report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is clean as a result: between the preschool and the high school of the Domspice, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as we do once, other rest.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Moreover, the incidents from the time since 1945, thus also consists of four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral manager of the Domspice.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole self-pedagogics, the cases, in which Knescent of sawk teachers, and painted, including defiled, did all appear on the school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really have to do the Andalusian authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But in them, Domkapellmeister George Ratzinger had nothing to do anything, because he got the boys only to face, when they had already been on the High School of grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It was like the very witnesses to emphasize the subject "Vorschule" tabu. "</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to be come back and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradigitalian" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was very different on the grammar school of grammar?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: as a result of discipline, but there was no sawed violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims of the general murder of R. took and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even positive memories of it."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So at the same time the case remains to have gone out.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods of periods in which it was reported by the listeners at the school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and from the predecessors of a school at which he was not part and responsible, (so the witness) nothing wanted to hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Lock Georg Ratzinger, in front of the listeners were consistently pursued the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the premises of the Domasium, the report of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In it, he pointed out that, "in the pre-school, the testing will continue to be practised."</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the danger of negative press reports, he is urgent.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was of course at a time, as a legal clarity, as a Prügeles were banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Earlier occurred in a legal grey area, like each of us probably still knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was too hard to estimate that the people might exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the permitted border had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say it, he could have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">In 1980, the testing penalty was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"" "Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said. yes, it is too cruel to apply today's educational standards at the time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How to see the?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we speak about the "Fallstrick of the Anachronism," i.e. the danger of last, past today's moral scale.</seg>
<seg id="2975">"" "the princess has been quite right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this, of course, of course not for sexual abuse, who was due to all times, and not for what was done in the school of resistance and violence against uncertain nurtures, that goes far beyond that time beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all very terrible and I am glad that it's finally opened.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take George Ratzinger in protection, because all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His funds for the prevention and punishment, so earthly and ears of the hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As physical punishment, then he was also strictly prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What is the image from his rainbow at the time, Georg Ratzinger has given for the talks with you for the book "My brother of Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the theme for testing and language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's going to be the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI., tells from his perspective, since then the Domspice is only a tributary.</seg>
<seg id="2984">However, I know that he led to a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">However, it must not be said to be said: without these perfectionism, without having been wrong, it would be hardly possible that they had to go into national culture and his musical tradition which twice twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and bonbons alone, one has come from rebellious boys now once a great singer and in every success, right to the field, but always discipline, passion and self-winding.</seg>
<seg id="2987">As what's for a man, you have experienced Georg Ratzinger on talks with their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: because of work on the book and beyond, I've met Georg Ratzinger really met again as a wonderful, humorous, basic set, deeply believing and warm welcome people, from which you can't imagine that he could also do just a fly in a bit.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regularly with how many former Domspice even today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly keep contact to him, he will be read, he is nearly blind and a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him until today, are therefore unique in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domters are to be grateful to him today that he has enriches her life and brought them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always have a good, fathers, good teacher, a strclose father, who may be his - but also a great respectant, too, to whom they still look at today and honor it truly remarkable.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, even though, even quite clearly: all that you are accusing him, educators, that were at the time on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have really overcome this time ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly active, a man, just because he is prominently prominently for one even more prominent brother, to make the medial sinners.</seg>
<seg id="2996">Since is the evil intention that it stands out, not too apparent.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The report, which was just released, has been revealed.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the attack would be purchased, a 93-year old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bayerns and perhaps one of Germany's no one who would know the Rainbow Domspice, finally in peace.</seg>
