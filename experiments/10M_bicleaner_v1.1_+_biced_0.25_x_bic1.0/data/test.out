gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger asked with some colleagues a bit absorption with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes , the horses took the horses in their home , they hunt in fast g@@ stop after the feed .
one kilometre at this pace , I have been afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus ended the equ@@ est@@ rian career again .
on Saturday , the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament wins - again near horses .
he settled with his family on the facility of the AL@@ RV , on a horse , he did not withdraw from photo to photography .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports help handed over the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala for the golden sports pyramid .
there is no explanation in the pleasant sport@@ sman .
Federal Minister of Cross , silver Lor@@ ra@@ ins , Champions Tour Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already been ge@@ ared him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
he arrived in Aachen on Saturday first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; this award means me very much , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for they will not only award for spor@@ tive successes , but also for social commitment . &quot;
since decades Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 other outstanding sport companies , the two @-@ time master winner was recorded on Saturday in the Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports . &quot;
the athletes include the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ l , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the ski@@ ers Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ um of the Erhard .
many of these sports watches were come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous society stayed in the jump stadium , where the Lav@@ azza price was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger took distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in comparison : IT &apos;s all about the money
in infrastructure and the trade agreements T@@ TP - this would like to prevent Clinton as a tr@@ ump .
however , the two US @-@ Presi@@ dency , however , are under control and energy policy as well as in a basic case .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ung and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental difference , more philosophi@@ cal difference .
this , on the role of the state .
tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warning that , as the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton explains the economy to death and regulate death , he says .
in contrast , it would be quite different , claims are tr@@ ump .
he will return to regulatory approval , and he makes a wide @-@ reaching control system with lower tax rates strong - for private professionals and businesses .
Clinton says , &quot; Clinton says : &quot; the state has to comply with certain tasks , he needs to open the dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
therefore , taxes for inclusion , they would be increased .
interest@@ ingly , both very close to the infrastructure .
in the fact , tr@@ ump and Clinton will be almost wor@@ shi@@ t .
the democratic application in announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment program in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are denied by government @-@ critical te@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
thus , there is still cross @-@ party discussions .
even more significant differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ashi wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and the coal production in the USA will be able to drive .
oil promotion is also to be protected in so far @-@ protected areas , the Par@@ isian climate agreement wants to raise .
Clinton wants to expand the renewable energies by renewable energy products : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energy and will create million jobs . &quot;
it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want to be there . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ des trade agreements , don &apos;t want to sign both .
at the same time , both the U.S. do not want to isol@@ ate the international trade - but just an American jobs better .
the should also be paid , too , calls for Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is to be a famine .
she wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
what do I want to do this question is not quite clear : once , he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ st , then he says , he will not be changed .
however , the great discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policies of the two camp .
on the one side stands , tr@@ ump , which aims to boost growth and citizens to boost growth .
his critics keep his critics before , so the budget deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to pay for at least of the road demand that they pay more taxes , and its critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; each frozen woman has experiences with sexual violence . &quot;
sexual violence is part of women who flee alone , almost as daily life .
if they are arriving in Germany , they are often sad .
a house offers refuge .
four women are sitting in a large kitchen .
every one has a baby that is only one year old .
one has placed her little son in the arm .
it gu@@ ed with great eyes curious about space in space .
his mother star@@ ed on the table top .
until they noticed that it is observed .
you s@@ mil@@ king short and add the little ones .
the scene is normal .
it speaks with Katrin B@@ ahr .
she has been Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social relief activities in Bavaria , and is dealing among other things with the theme of women on the flight .
four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the North in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized accommodations for women @-@ related women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs won the establishment together with Pro Family and the Munich Women &apos;s aid .
recently , she became officially opened .
there are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children .
males there is no - not as visitors .
the exception is a qu@@ mann in front of the door .
&quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say , &quot; every woman who has been here on her escape experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; men escape to wars because they are politically prosec@@ uted because of their families , torture or death , or because their families they send as a hopes to Europe , &quot; she tells them .
in women , there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal out of them , because they don &apos;t see any other way away . &quot;
in her home , she made experience with sexual violence , forced , hon@@ our@@ able , slave or forced pro@@ stitution .
this drives them .
on the flight goes further .
&quot; that tu@@ g for example , for a bottle of water is a sexual act , is no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think that the end , as soon as they arrived in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
even here would be used women in refugee camps often used as min@@ der@@ less , and the worst case would be ab@@ used .
that leads to that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich north , are traum@@ atis@@ ed .
some of the children are sure to sur@@ rendered . &quot;
many women are so much that they say nothing .
&quot; or they can &apos;t be trusted to speak about the salvation because the sh@@ am is great . &quot;
since they often have not help to help you need more accommodations only for them , calls for B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district regi@@ strations are responsible for the lodging of refugees .
on the question whether they are using a similar project as in Munich in its influ@@ x area , reply some with no .
in the Upper Palat@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are something in accommodations of the governments .
even in Schw@@ aben , women were not separated by women , Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press Officer of the government .
in Ober@@ bayern , Lower Saxony and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are some common store@@ ys or own homes , only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bayern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
also the committee &quot; rights of women and equality of the sexes &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men .
in a study that has been published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; if your privacy or women can be accommod@@ ated together , it may lead to - for@@ ge violence against women . &quot;
above all the rooms should be separated and accessible for women , is available in the study .
like the women of this protective needs , you can see on And@@ rang , which is on the building in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the fact that there is us that we have a long waiting time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you might make a second house .
Assist@@ ants . disc@@ ern@@ ing : demands for new work amp@@ ut@@ ations
deputy head of the assistant , have called her union to claim new labour measures in their stri@@ ves regarding a new contract .
the Junior Do@@ ctors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) demanded its entire Council starting at the beginning of September more labour measures approved .
the J@@ DC said that there were Minister of reference to the wor@@ ried about the contract .
assistant , and medical student students have agreed upon the rejection of an agreement with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who have rejected in the elections .
in a letter to the members who published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , said that the government had been imp@@ eded to problems , &quot; which was rejected that the agreement was rejected .
she said : &quot; in view of the J@@ DC Executive Board , the proposed new contract has been fully covered by the proposed new contract , and official permission to all marri@@ ages . &quot;
in response to the government of the government , the J@@ DC Board has granted a formal application to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to begin a cross @-@ up program , which begins at the beginning of September .
the stri@@ vings led to this year , the Assist@@ ants of this year has six sm@@ ashing out the first overall cases in the N@@ HS &apos;s history .
the leader of the BM@@ A assistant , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came to the election to the rejection of the agreed contract , which were recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared the BM@@ A members throughout the sessions who were still held before the vote through 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants , and students of medical students took place , with that the Treaty should be beneficial .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jer@@ emy H@@ unt said that the Treaty for physicians in England would be introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of outdoor side &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure which finished a crisis .
the leader of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and an official end of the eight @-@ month @-@ long war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart at the St. Petersburg Palace of St. Petersburg in reception , I can not leave me out of the press @-@ pressure that Ankara is at most pro@@ vocation .
there was the hand@@ held , yes .
but Put@@ e@@ smile took part in the smile , and he hardly any heat from , even for its back conditions .
on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan spoke according to his &quot; love friend &quot; Putin - according to a report of five times .
I couldn &apos;t count anymore .
he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even further improve .
on the next day , a newspaper showed that Erdo@@ gan would like to know that Erdo@@ gan would like to happen before , as if it had never happened .
I seemed to indicate his enthusiasm rather than the opposite .
but one of Putin @-@ radi@@ ant , sustainable Kü@@ ch found that the state of Staff had nothing forgotten .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the firing of a Russian fight against Turkey in the Syrian border .
in Moscow to the time was w@@ anting bran@@ ched .
Putin explained and accused Ankara , Russia in the back .
the go was even bigger , as it was perpet@@ rated by a friend of my friend .
the Vet@@ ema again re@@ build it difficult , if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a sharp , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once , it seemed as if the Turks would bear the guil@@ t for everything the guil@@ t .
on the serious case , the accus@@ ations from executive officials announced that Earth &apos;s own family had been benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in the areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he cont@@ ested it v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message , that it was time to look back to the front .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin was the President of Erdo@@ gan &apos;s President of Erdo@@ gan &apos;s resolution that he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to book a kind victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a tru@@ ce is clear in the hand .
Earth &apos;s Erdo@@ gan requires all friends that he can get dead , after he became a coup d &apos;@@ etat in a coup d &apos;@@ etat in the last month .
terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken it .
but there is also economic motifs .
Russian sanctions will be hard to hit Turkey - in particular the ban of charter flights , which is usually to bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number is dropped by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel management and charter companies can be facilit@@ ated if the flights will be res@@ um@@ ed again .
you count on a late summer of the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the State TV provides fruit and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti stated it as follows : &quot; tourists there , tomatoes are long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is in the west to w@@ aged , since it &apos;s reaction to the power in response to power as a weak response .
to this end , the persistent Gro@@ ll of the EU accession negotiations for the negotiations for accession to the EU &apos;s accession negotiations and Putin is to go out from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the west .
the Russian President leader took Ankara in Ankara with security a bonus that he demanded a coup d &quot; é@@ tat to support the elected coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is intended for Moscow to be a self @-@ contra@@ ctual that even had a profound fear of opponents .
the summit meeting place in this glorious palace , with Russia and Turkey , as it described an analyst , as it described an analyst , &quot; Alliance of external side &quot; : two countries that deals with the West and have treated bad .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still large differences between the two still wide differences .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow were recently held the role as a peace agreements , but where Russia and Turkey were able to support Turkey .
it could be possible that after nearly three hours on the initial conversation , both President had said to press conference on the press conference that they did not harm the theme .
in fact , President of Turkey prevented it possible to reply to a question about their differenti@@ ation , whereas Putin decided to emphasize them .
it is not a clear con@@ sensus about where a common N@@ en@@ ner can be found in Syria .
but after months of hos@@ tility , and in view of the potential of the potential , the Nato @-@ member Turkey set to the Russian martial jet - it &apos;s certainly better to talk about two heads of state at least .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland is no longer available .
R@@ BS was said to be reduced to a joint venture role according to the Board of Chief of Staff to the Bank &apos;s Executive Board .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ EW@@ AN , the BBC Scotland , announced that the R@@ BS was connected with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the Bank has since di@@ stan@@ sted since then , when it had been almost k@@ oll@@ ed almost k@@ oll@@ ed and saved after eight years .
in this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts have used &quot; R@@ BS &quot; to protect other final consumer brands .
they supported the international sport with millions of pounds to Spon@@ sor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wimble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to focus more national stamps in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised head and the setting up to Nat@@ West change .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand has been used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other kind of smaller brands for private customer business to obtain more importance - Cout@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ EW@@ AN was inter@@ viewed during a tour tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will be at our investor brand , as well as at the brand , under our employees , as we are now engaged in a Bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank himself became a global brand , R@@ BS was launched to global brand .
I say now that we are no global targets , but local goals .
each of these stamps are used in their own municipalities for something completely different and our employees are working under these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that his Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing is not more continued and that it will increase the perception of various brands in its Sport @-@ Spon@@ sor@@ ing .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop the brands of brands , as we focus on inside ( we asked us ) to make this for a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Chairman of Staff .
it would have been very z@@ yn@@ isch for three years ago , when we said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched this brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think we will see many changes .
we can re @-@ launched this stamps again , so I think that time has come .

Russia &apos;s Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has been released by the Russian President Vladimir Putin .
Ivan@@ ov was a lot of years of the eng@@ aging confi@@ denti@@ ality of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport committee .
in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin without information for reasons &quot; the dism@@ iss@@ al Ivan@@ ov@@ s was arranged by his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been Ivan@@ ov@@ s &apos;s deputy since 2012 , was named after his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the est@@ onian capital of Tallinn , he made his gradu@@ ating at the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo .
on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ g. it is called ( to Russian ) that he was later to head @-@ head and Chief Executive Officer of the Regi@@ er@@ ship .
he said about his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it &apos;s the most important mission of the government to support his activity as a state of law and insp@@ ections to the implementation of your instructions .
Putin was shared by the Russian TV station on Friday , that Ivan@@ ov has asked about to leave his post and v@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the s@@ mil@@ ing faces ?
this step has been mysterious from Moscow .
Sergej Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the narrow@@ est confi@@ denti@@ sts of Vladimir Put@@ ins and works as he works for the Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB .
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on TV , both men who returned to his own request .
but despite the not@@ ns for the cameras , here are just a few of it - above all , just before the parliamentary elections .
is here the result of a type of power struggle ?
no one doesn &apos;t have no one .
but the official statement - that a man who had once had to act as a potential president , I stum@@ bled upon the Russian environmental policy - reached big sk@@ ep@@ sis .
in his remarks on Putin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; says Ivan@@ ov , &quot; it is true that I have asked me in a conversation to me this very complicated post - it could say almost as good for four years .
as it turned out , I &apos;ve been the Chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration since four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian security Council and how Putin is former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , the K@@ GB , was appointed Ivan@@ ov in his deputy representative .
when Putin took power to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , which he trusted in most confi@@ dential .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become the second term president of Russia , as a third term coup against the Constitution .
but this post has been taken by another , near @-@ called ally coup coup , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president after three and a half years later .

he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensland &apos;s Cross@@ ing .
we are all witnesses of an engineering of an ep@@ ep@@ tic measurements in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of completion between the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck has a heat activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
all in all , almost 79 % of the entire bridge cks at their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks will get a Bet@@ ong@@ le for the Deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to get to its seat .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Con@@ stru@@ ctors said : &quot; the first lock is a significant milestone in each bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the closure of future @-@ proof high and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last street cover@@ t and its connection with the expansion of the North @-@ deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or country side .
this was achieved by the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and very hei@@ k@@ le activity .
massive , because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , approx . 6.000 tons , weighs about 3 % after a slope of approx . 3 % .
hei@@ r , as the toler@@ ances , that the team has been working , win@@ zig - on each side , it is only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately , everything was very good .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men do not have good luck to life in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
three men have not allowed to be lucky enough on life after they were thrown by her fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI Type is proposed on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm , after a crew was observed in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties in security to swim during their boat moved from its own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat was shot in its vicinity , and put us the worst , &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones .
fortunately the strong winds have already had the boat already out of its range , until we were added to water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were saved by a local fishermen , during the third man at the age of 60 , he was found in a boiler that was found .
they came all on board of the coastline and were returned back to the rescue station .
Mr. Jones said , &quot; The three men who were cast into the water , are lucky and still alive .
the boat engine had a not@@ ran@@ pl@@ a , but in the K@@ ent@@ ern of the Bo@@ ots of the person , the boat was able to control the boat .
someone talked about these men today .
it was badly damaged - man on his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
as the police approved yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the keys to get the apartment to get his personal things .
instead of the non @-@ alcoholic , the clothes made the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
when these came to the apartment , he st@@ ach twice on them .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by hand and injured .
the police could carry the perpet@@ rators .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ ar@@ um had to be his sister to his sister .
together with her life , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
it was able to move him to leave the apartment .
therefore , they went with her life @-@ mate from the house .
on the street they met the ex @-@ habitat of the man .
when the two women left the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old is his sister to his website , and his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
who is building accommodations apartments ?
the SPD and regards to my : investors are supposed to be mandatory much more in the duty .
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig in the next few years almost 1300 cheap apartments will lose ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Action Concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next install@@ ment session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet war is programmed .
the first line is to be the question : who should actually build a favourable apartments ?
one regulation is missing .
SPD Executive Vice President Christoph Dal@@ mann said : &quot; we are trying to build ourselves with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build urban areas in future will need 20 percent of all apartments as a soci@@ ology . &quot;
the affordable apartments , however , can also be produced .
but the big armed forces in the city hall was , but Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you want to build Asia with investors who want to build private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want to build investors on these areas of at least 10 percent , but as possible as 20 per cent of the apartments are served as a soci@@ ology . &quot;
a new urban residential building programme which will cost millions of cost will cost and it will be financed to allow for attack .
the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is still no agreement between the fra@@ ctions &quot; at the moment .
the CD@@ U would like to make more detailed regulations as possible .
the left is still hardness editions for investors .
because of this , Brat@@ mann , b@@ ah@@ ne is a disappearance of the situation on the housing market .
the Dec@@ ision concept is implemented , will ensure additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the experts .
yet the program does not fully follow : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments should be built , they should be built .
but how do not make a loss of some 1,@@ 300 affordable apartments whose promotion is running in the next few years ?
until 2020 , there will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , in order to prevent the planners , Nicole Palm ® , you should now be purchased the ongoing rate of the city .
in addition , they would have to be thought again to get back to the price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
the problem solve the problem .
because in the western city the end of Fri@@ end@@ ship .
about 1800 apartments could you get back to the price for cheap apartments .
only : this is the owner , the residential construction companies not .
because the number of soci@@ ology in Western town will be dras@@ tically increased , removed from the aim of the so @-@ called mixture .
a concentration of socialist weak in just a few city share it should not be more .
the Green anticip@@ ate that there will be more motion in the discussion .
group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ schke said : &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must be with the boat . &quot;
that is concent@@ rates on more buildings for family homes .
but what does not means that not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , which is worth@@ while
it is fascinating to look like the world .
that teen@@ ager and child can not go out to the outside , but rather prefer to spend their time to spend on screens , and in the last decade of many compl@@ ains .
for Pok@@ em@@ on Go , it &apos;s about to pick up people from the sofa and can be active .
the time at the screen was initially limited on TV , video on video game and most recently on smartphones .
therefore , it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities do not close each other each other .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn that is based on the characters which initially were created for video game in the 1990s ( later created a drawing series , play@@ cards and other spin @-@ off ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture s@@ unk the interest before the release of the game in the United States , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
in other countries , the market launch in other countries moved to the massive demand that the server over@@ load the server .
within less days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it works ?
in short , the player go out to poker by car , and looking for Pok@@ é@@ mons , which were followed by a GPS , once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; caught . &quot;
a generation that played the game , when she was still younger , joined the W@@ ahn and sp@@ rang up for the search for the sofa .
in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that puts the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
car@@ dio m , an app for Apple Watch , distributed by 3@@ 5,000 users , shared the Washington Post with launch that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of participants followed every day 30 minutes , by 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know , who plays in Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it looks only the rough data to increase performance .
many public awareness campaigns to health , people who want to bring up &quot; about 30 minutes to come &quot; and &quot; every day to be active on your ears , because many public em@@ b@@ assies around the health are boring , and of people come to look .
nevertheless , the importance of sports can not be assessed .
who regularly take Sport drives to reduce its chances to cancer or depression .
physical exercise helps with weights control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages that lead to a long time to handle them here .
but the wonderful at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open air that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people include close to the hunt even new friends .
as always there is also m@@ ür@@ k game per@@ ish@@ ops , which must always be compl@@ ain about anything .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what is said to &apos; s ?
it is a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit already travelled to our activity , they gave us a reason to push the sport , as it does this game .
the new will lose its friction , and the use will be re@@ plen@@ ished with the time .
due to Pok@@ em@@ ons , there will be more games , the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ates will be combined in the real world and to be able to help many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and ges@@ tions .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all the im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly with the beams .
breathtaking view on the floor .
full line .
and now finally Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for multi @-@ battle titles and expanded the gap between the world and the rest of the world from all eyes below the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal and &quot; Final Five &quot; Mann@@ ers in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze winner in Ali@@ ya Mu@@ en@@ ina .
the American Simone Bil@@ es tournaments on the sulph@@ ate beams during the single @-@ multi @-@ campaign women in the Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American player , which wins a combined competition , and overall the fifth , while she fes@@ ates its reputation , the best of their generation or even at all .
she broke out in Tränen than her end result was shown and her long journey went into this moment .
that success , in the same league , like a unique athletes like Michael P@@ lot , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es won the last three years of sports art , including ten gold medals - including ten gold medals - including amazing exercises , that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u ba@@ il@@ out , who said , &quot; she said , &quot; the best Tur@@ ner@@ in is ever seen , I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it is expected to be a last test in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athlete , but rather between their and a last @-@ dimensional expectations .
not with a handful of gold back to the family in spring , Texas , would be the dis@@ appointment as dis@@ appointment .
the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , after having won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ campaign of women at the Summer Olympics of 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first Medal on Tuesday , while it served on the f@@ arewell celebration of the attempted murder of Cre@@ aboli@@ tion Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as an ex@@ cl@@ amation mark .
although it insi@@ sted on , during their long journey to the top , never have planned the future , it is not really true .
one part of their soil exercises - the typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music , at home at home at the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio de Janeiro .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , which was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child , and was Aim@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school @-@ flu@@ ke into the gym , was promoted to the Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s force .
for the summer of 2013 , she has not lost no combined competition in the summer of 2013 , a victory series that will keep so long as it will wish .
even if Mu@@ en@@ ina grew slightly , clou@@ dy the picture .
sulph@@ ur beams and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ es holds the world championship title .
she again went back with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the Schwe@@ be@@ es again - and set up an 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man im@@ pover@@ ished it gently to her end - a pure form of formations - and a blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision they had once described in their collective book , in reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when they fought the third place but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ en@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man sur@@ geon had to be named after the Americans &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; a lead .
after her ground , they threw the audience of Kus@@ sh@@ arks , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback which sometimes a desper@@ ation appeared .
what makes it concerns , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week has a very new significance :
police : 3 victims of serial production in the music will be shot at the car .
according to police reports that were posted on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot in one of the deadly attacks by Phoenix , while they were in the car and heard the music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , during the car in a drive was par@@ ked to the authorities .
the perpet@@ rators fired eight shots from a hand@@ mo@@ cking weapon , while it was on the passenger side of the cars and subsequently fled to another vehicle , is to read in the report .
the police announced that the triple murder is not the result of a space of smokers , as the Ang@@ li@@ fer does not have the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were in possession of an adult victims .
by the police , Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting took up the investig@@ ators to become an immediate view of whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
in total , predominantly in h@@ is@@ pan@@ anic housing that killed seven people in nine attacks and injured two more injured .
&quot; it happens in a residence in front of a house , &quot; says Howard K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects several vehicles used , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ llac or Lincoln .
the investigations refused to consider evidence of evidence that they were led to the conclusion that attacks , and were perpet@@ rated by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was in@@ scri@@ bed due to their injuries and passed away .
liners , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness to the police thought that it was not unusual to sit in a par@@ able car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which went to an empty pick@@ up truck to half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and went out that it was the production of the series @-@ series .
investigations found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and used a ball from the seat , as well as glob@@ ular fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ op@@ ie : &quot; it will be better &quot;
like the most 6 @-@ year @-@ old loves Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the S@@ ingen , toys and of course his mother .
but like the fe@@ west of his retirement , Edmund micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , who had not knew his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time I was my first thought , I made this not .
I didn &apos;t know this .
I did not leave me .
which is not true -- of course , one has left out of course , &quot; said she said .
by her husband Vincent and her husband revealed that Edmund will never recognize them under circumstances and that he may not survive .
some doctors went even so far that they stroke him to become institutional .
&quot; my first answer was &quot; I didn &apos;t know that the people still make &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Edmund can run with the help of a walking aid .
Edmund could not sit down to his third @-@ year @-@ old neither sit still cra@@ w@@ ling and he cannot speak yet .
but he makes slowly progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he loves to play with his two brothers and sing , too .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language , which Edmund for &quot; Please note me something before . &quot;
&quot; we bring him a drawing language at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s no typical drawing language -- it says . Edmund has invented some character alone .
micro@@ c@@ eps has a variety of causes : genetic like in Edmund and infections with viruses like Mas@@ ern or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly vary .
it is still early to say about how it will affect the life of the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus In@@ ds .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds on the emotional price of a certain future .
I asked about what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they don &apos;t really know yet .
I have been asked for a long time since a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone for someone else .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has caused a great interest rate for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects which were caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it is better .
you know it will be better for you better .
you will love your child and love your child .

why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I have been under the women &apos;s ol@@ ympi@@ a , and made it out of more than a reason .
first of all I &apos;ve been in the summer of 1984 at every summer ol@@ ympi@@ ads and the USA were never so dominant .
and secondly : these team has three tur@@ ret , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspired for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team that A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the J@@ ew is and Madison Ko@@ cian , which Cath@@ o@@ kin is round out , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally reflected the USA .
it has the black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ mic female presence at the top of this sport art .
in the last four years , number one was one of the female Tur@@ ner@@ ers an Af@@ ro @-@ American .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas a surprising Olympi@@ age@@ in and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three times world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they unexpected , but most frequ@@ ented g@@ ym@@ as@@ tics rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual the American player , who won for women with an individual majority event for women .
Mann@@ ers member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but you can &apos;t see Turn@@ classes throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie came all of the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; last Five , &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad is only four Tur@@ ns inside the team . besides , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ ol@@ yi as trainer .
but the reality is that Tur@@ quoise is an expensive sport , and Turner at first line in private gym , which are exciting for training , education , travel clothing , competition , competition and hotel cost ( for the coach and their Turner and families ) .
the majority of these gym can be found in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
in these verses the Turner received their entire training and that is an expensive training and a long @-@ term commitment .
Aim@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both their athletes , ever since they have started with the tower .
we have to be inspired by the municipalities Au@@ n many , young girls who will be inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie .
I was founded in 20 years old .
we offer free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for over 15,000 people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ical ) , and national and international winners .
in September we will continue to Detroit ( my home town ) , in order to provide the youth high @-@ quality tur@@ nen , to get the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sports art .
tur@@ nen developed strength , flexibility and coordination to the body , as well as hard work , discipline and destination for the spirit .
this combination provides life @-@ long benefits for health and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that thousands of young girls to be interested in , and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
this is an exciting time .
thanks to Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by Hol@@ es of the Olympic clubteam nationals and thank you for many young girls with different background , to begin their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women .

culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness can be blo@@ om in Muslim areas in Muslim countries
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ for Rah@@ man was removed last year for corruption from the ministry of corruption .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to that most widely used election was ignored in Muslim towns like a non @-@ governmental report today .
the former Cabinet member of Sir Eric Pic@@ les have access the police , elect@@ oral way and Rath@@ le@@ ties for that evidence of elect@@ oral abuse concerning eth@@ nie and religion , were ignored .
the former Minister for Integration and communal government , now said that the power of vot@@ ers from religious Mo@@ tives was so bad that the police should be allowed to establish a lock@@ smith outside of elect@@ oral cabins by order to protect the vot@@ ers .
he recommends that vot@@ ers should make a reference to prove their identity in order to prove their identity .
at the moment a vot@@ er must just call his name and address .
the report proposes that not dis@@ able to bring the fingers of a person if they give her election , to prevent someone twice a time .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for that the press has more access to the municipal utilities and decisions of non @-@ official commissions or work groups .
&quot; it is not only used against elect@@ oral fraud , but also the municipal government is in front of the wider corruption and financial cor@@ rug@@ ated culture , which is able to protect , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets elect@@ and@@ als in the East of London .
last year , a Special Court decided that the mayor mayor Lut@@ for Rah@@ man should be cor@@ rup@@ ted on cor@@ rup@@ ted and illegal practices of its Am@@ tes .
the Court found that Rah@@ man might have been dec@@ eived the religious feelings of his Muslim community , &quot; and said that he would have brought his critics with rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us@@ - and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations to the silence .
Rah@@ man should be &quot; his campaign based on the basis , that it will be able to choose from Muslims , to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either undoubtedly , or the result of a breakdown at one person than someone else .
Sir Eric said that it was over all the country of evidence for fraud .
he expressed himself in particular al@@ arm@@ ing on the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter by the older members of the Muslim community , to people who chose to choose one of their choice .
Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean the elect@@ oral system , including the anten@@ n@@ ity to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof that pressure on protection must have exercised members of several ethnic minorities , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the machine of the El@@ der , in particular communities with pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or ban@@ anas .
&quot; there were no concerns that ... public institutions were aware of such a behavior because of &quot; political correct &quot; superi@@ ority in the eth@@ nie and religion were ignored . &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the pro@@ hibition that political activists in order to stop &quot; elect@@ oral documents &quot; to stop .
the report , which is pulled out by Ther@@ esa May in Rec@@ eived , requires harder registration tests to prevent that the election will be used to Im@@ mi@@ gra@@ dation and social cases .
options may be considered , select vot@@ ers before the election after your ID .
not an removable ink on the fingers of a person if she has given her voice to prevent someone twice a time .
systematic reviews of the nationality must be carried out of an person to ensure that they are voting .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic letter @-@ election .
the ban on the political activists , complete the letters of the letters of letters .
the police give up the police , dis@@ rup@@ tions around the elect@@ oral stations .
this was an amend@@ ment to facilit@@ ates an indictment due to the repression of the repression of the People Act of the People Act 1983 ( Pe@@ oples Republic of 1983 ) .

requirement that only English can be used in the elect@@ oral stations ( except for Wales ) .
Inten@@ si@@ fication of the workout , to ensure that the employees will show that vot@@ ers will walk alone in the elect@@ oral way .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amaz@@ ingly , &quot; that after the Tower of Ham@@ lets there was no jurisdiction before the Tower of Ham@@ lets .
&quot; the elect@@ oral tribunal of the Lut@@ man of Rah@@ man and his deputy for a state of corruption and illegal practices as unt@@ au@@ glich , &quot; said he said . &quot;
he was found guilty on a number of reasons for reasons - according to the high demands of the criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ised the more effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ checks &quot; of the elect@@ oral departments of the Town Hall .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Court of Justice in Tower Ham@@ lets from the last year was a warning .

&quot; he is a well @-@ looking guy , so that I &apos;ve done it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular Ver@@ se since London 2012 will be able to come to focus on the focus : the simil@@ arity between the British photographer Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular Ac@@ tor Neil Patrick Harris .

how to protects with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before weapons strikes .
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make him a little safe .
we spoke with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to figure out how to get rid of armed rob@@ bers .
regardless of whether you have from the front or behind the back , you will show you how to rot@@ ate your rob@@ ber the split .
if you arrive at the back of the back , then you should go as a ride , so you can see your anxiety and take off from the circuit , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulders before you hit him with your free ell@@ bow .
beat him with the knees and turn left , while the Ang@@ li@@ fer is pain in pain , the weapon of his hands . beat him with the run and move up , while they pass on the gun on him .
with Ang@@ li@@ zer , which is similar to the front , is the technique similar to your body , take your body and turn your body and turn it , so that the Ang@@ li@@ fer can &apos;t shoot .
stay at the same time the weight on the weapon and beat the drain on the chest , then turn the gun from his handle before they move on and move the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?
see the video to see exactly what it makes up to Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that it &apos;s in a cigarette case , your money is not sufficient , unless a ri@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master are not available .
travel Ian Wright sch@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est sites in Europe
a British travel with his immune system and Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex moved to a serious review by giving some of the dirt and ek@@ est places of Europe .
the present@@ er and travel writer Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k ch@@ aired on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a dish@@ ed head of a tractor toilet and a public telephone in Russia to establish the resistance of his immune system .
before Ab@@ le@@ cks any property , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show and let us know what he will be .
but the experiment , which was fil@@ tered under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner St@@ reng@@ th &quot; , brought some surprising results in daylight .
the thought , the dish@@ ed head of a train toilet , who was used already by thousands of others , may be completely shock , but actually , in a kitchen sp@@ aw@@ le more poor bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright said with doctors and medical specialists across the promotion of Dar@@ mb@@ aber@@ ien as well as his own health .
fortunately , in the mouth he left nothing , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of its Dar@@ ms by the world and ate wonderful things as well as wonderful things .
from public money to rail stations up to r@@ ins@@ ing of toilets , the task presented his immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he told : &quot; already as a child , I was relatively un@@ wor@@ ried about what my health concerns and I have put all possible things in my mouth , Earth , saus@@ ages and s@@ amm@@ ate . &quot;
in the film he became aware of his reputation in each case .
the dispos@@ ed what he able@@ , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his pro@@ stitution showed a L@@ umin@@ ometric count of more than 4000 units .
in comparison to this , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ er@@ ation amounts to less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to hold out after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ er@@ ation about 4000 units , while fresh hands would have a less@@ er hands of less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel agency &apos; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner St@@ reng@@ th , &quot; who shows the bacter@@ i@@ ties in various locations as the bathroom shows
in the film he says : &quot; that comes the worst , what I have heard in a toilet , close to . &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I &apos;ll have nothing to get here , because there is dr@@ el@@ ter here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner St@@ reng@@ th &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company uses Mr Wright with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D , to support the promotion of Dar@@ mb@@ aber@@ ien and immune system .
Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to do something new !
something that look ahead for watching and at the same time the benefits of Pro@@ bio@@ tics is explained .
we conducted Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings through the so that we told &quot; L@@ ass us Ian call . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is to become a global phenomenon .
instead of talk about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , meaning the importance of intestinal health and how they are linked with the immune system .
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon , and with the documentary we could provide the consumers for more information on a interesting way and manner .
I think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the Director of the film , added : &quot; let &apos;s say it my respect for Ian , when he had suffered some of the things that I have made him to le@@ aks them like the ec@@ lip@@ se Russian toilet , that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things to bring easier to whom it was simple , Ian , and others , where these were quite hard .
I am glad that we have recorded some of these dirty treat in film . &quot;
in a survey conducted by the Vali@@ o survey conducted by the year 2015 , 84 percent of those surve@@ yed with the well @-@ being of the stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally products that are supplied with lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus fo@@ lic acid .

a as@@ o@@ zi@@ al family left their soci@@ ably reward after a dele@@ tion with an amount of £ 50,000 because they had their neighbours .
Tan@@ ya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list at complaints by its estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were forci@@ bly removed from its estate , sho@@ cked staff of the residential housing the property found in an un@@ repaired state .
the walls of the holes were broken down , wooden slides were torn down , gar@@ bage was scattered at the floor and gra@@ ffiti on the walls .
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they now lives in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said they fears that the apartment is no longer repair .
she said , &quot; It was the absolute Alb@@ bes for the people here and I am the view that people do not need to live in this way .
there are many things to take into account as this estate is probably not as a nice part of Corn@@ walls .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also the not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , who had meanwhile lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror was added to the families with Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ots , mat@@ ernity , drug abuse , drug addi@@ ctions , drugs and floo@@ ding .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was signed on the lease , got an arrangement of anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some areas of the house that will be dem@@ ol@@ ished under circumstances , old gar@@ bage was found .
in the case , in which past drugs were tra@@ ded , the wood pl@@ ain@@ es were destroyed .
neighbors , neighbours , that they saw them on the streets , and regularly had to fight against the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing de@@ o@@ vers@@ aw them and their partner these week are violent by the property , after they gave them a prolon@@ ged limit of 11 weeks to advance .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ bility were che@@ ered by poor neighbours , saying that her life was taken to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years apart from them and it was always bad .
the many times , which we say the police here , are incredible .
today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood on because there was so quiet@@ ly - that is not known here !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam Fitz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ g@@ ations En@@ forcement Manager by Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that there were the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was in regular intervals , 20 years old .
on the hand side of the municipal house were gar@@ bage and old toys .
he added : &quot; it is a shame that it was able to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as there is an del@@ o@@ gi@@ ate of the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing may be considered .
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extremely difficult and its deeds for their neighbours to view .
I guess all the work , which my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community , have gone down to us , and have enjoyed the information you have done .
I hope that the development of some neighbours , which is conve@@ yed and the message is conve@@ yed that anti @-@ social behaviour is not toler@@ ated .
Fitz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons have lived at different times in the house , but that they all have over 20 .
a dirty mattress , who left in one of the bedroom of the house after the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ching on the floor .
workers of the house administration will now have a waste of waste @-@ mountains , which are surrounded by the house .
in 2014 , the police led a raid in the house and took over 70@@ g cannabis as well as orph@@ an@@ age , par@@ ap@@ her@@ ni@@ es and cash at £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine of fine , after they found guilty of a drug in the class B in trading view .
they gave that the money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of their son Lee Skel@@ don was , who came in 2013 during a car accident in 2013 .
after they were without Ob@@ roof , it &apos;s out that Tan@@ ya , and their partner will now have live in a private accommodation at Pl@@ ymouth .
many of the walls of the house were gra@@ ffiti with gra@@ ffiti by Gra@@ ffiti .

Turkey : Kur@@ dish Community reck@@ ons with mass flu@@ ence
&quot; if you don &apos;t fit and Erdo@@ gan of Earth , he sits on the packed caffeine , &quot; says the vali@@ ant @-@ based foundation dialog and the world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ dish commune of Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of protection from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , it could even be &quot; several hundreds of thousands of &quot; are believed to become the leader Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
after the hard trial of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , to Germany , expects a mass flu@@ ence to Germany after the attempted assassination of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan .
a short term of thousands of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fighting the minorities and the democratic opposition to the democratic opposition , &quot; says the Verb@@ and@@ s@@ presi@@ dents Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World . &quot;
because the government had moved out two months of Kur@@ bur@@ gen with crimes , more than 500,000 Kurds are within Turkey during the flight .
after the disast@@ rous put@@ sch are still sec@@ ular and op@@ position@@ ist ethnic Turks .
many are new to begin in Europe , when they are re@@ pressed further in Turkey .
&quot; it may not be that a state which he produced even refugees , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , &quot; said top@@ ra@@ k .
the Chief of Staff accused the targeted approach of sy@@ r@@ an Arab in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ ic@@ tic cities .
in order to raise the Kurds , Erdo@@ gan to the remaining Kurds would increase to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armenia and Greeks , already in the past hundred years , &quot; said top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member .
the Association of Staff demanded that the federal government was so sharp like Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
also in Germany , a &quot; hex@@ en@@ hunt &quot; against Earth @-@ critic is held in Germany .
I feel very safe in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the vali@@ ant movement also fears the escape of many Turks .
there are more Turks for asylum in Germany , above all the Kurds , and opposition .
the Brand@@ mark@@ ung as vali@@ ant @-@ tra@@ ilers and other acade@@ mics began his professional existence .
&quot; if you don &apos;t fit and Erdo@@ gan of Earth , the Kem@@ alists and sä@@ kul@@ ar , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , President of the vali@@ ant @-@ based Foundation and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper were reported on the numbers of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks had already been the biggest group of asylum in Germany because of political persecution , asylum in Germany .
as of June 30 , this is 11.@@ 386 people and nearly 29 per cent of all known as as@@ yl@@ ated ( 3@@ 9,@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , not the war , poverty or lack of evidence is f@@ lown in this survey .

Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; then go , where it is we@@ aken . &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not to choose the country day .
she understood it in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
2021 will not take place at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
as far as far as far , it &apos;s not : summer holidays , heat and landing tests - which is included .
the locals , who are convinced by the elections , are supposed to be on holiday .
the very many tourists that are on the country , in U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen , or Hi@@ d@@ den@@ see , are not the locals , though not the country &apos;s day .
in addition to this , practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ per , the posters depend on air bal@@ lo@@ ons , flyer and at the end of the vote , just ir@@ ev@@ ing .
by September 4 , 2016 , the elect@@ oral Day of the last holiday house , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must pass over the people over the people .
the hot stage when you can ever say that it has just started .
and it also goes to something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition has to fear his ministry .
the SPD , which has been strongest party since 1998 , is now clear behind the CD@@ U .
what is exciting , as strong Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D ab@@ orted and what remains at the end of Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 , Chief of Staff , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ structive campaign , you can see from his large posters .
he travels through the country , with ro@@ ses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , as it is also his legendary artist Harald Ring@@ storff present .
otherwise , sailors will get cold feet and gives the guil@@ t at the salvation of the Af@@ el .
their refugee policy , her &quot; We create , &quot; have acceler@@ ating the rise of rect@@ angle lists , which will probably cost the nice office cost .
the CD@@ U with its top candidate candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has experienced , as it is , if you are at the right place in the right place .
she has invited twice German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Grand Chancellor Angela Merkel in the northeast .
but the target group not voted , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as the Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; since it was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; accused Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR .
but it seems too bad to hear from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise the nor@@ theastern CD@@ U is largely restricted to the usual election campaign on market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and air bal@@ lo@@ ons .
this , so Kok@@ ert , plays only one &quot; role . &quot;
also the Union has also noticed that its base has been cr@@ um@@ ed on the land that it must be very strict to find out again a wire to the people .
you are like the Left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the country hardly exist .
the Council of the CD@@ U elect@@ ret to his fellow @-@ stroke , however , &quot; you have to go to them , where people are we@@ aken , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much on the game is , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to be called for a particularly dedicated election campaign .
in surveys the Social Democrats began with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the 2011 election the SPD gained clear with 35@@ ,@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , have been able to create the lea@@ p in the land day .
they make of the holidays in need a modern tu@@ ce and put their elect@@ oral campaign to the Internet .
&quot; Online @-@ election campaign , &quot; calls it the Landes@@ ver@@ ende Claudia Mu@@ eller .
otherwise , the green elect@@ oral war@@ dro@@ bes came on track to national mood among tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top candidate country , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house @-@ boat with the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ i lakes and it is also beautiful .
her impression : &quot; election holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 refurb@@ ishment : guest places suffer from Sper@@ m
on the speed , with which the B 27 has been renovated , there is nothing to m@@ eck@@ ern .
for the developers of construction work , which start at 5,@@ 30 o &apos;clock in the morning , and only about 20 o &apos;clock , there are praise to praise .
&quot; we have done everything quite z@@ ack@@ ered , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet petrol station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is no chance to suit .
the construction site could be transferred on the weekend at half time to the South , scheduled to be completed by the end of October .
praised God will also be praised to work for the construction work , for example , if it comes to the establishment of Beh@@ el &apos;s establishment .
since the construction site on Monday after the south , the sper@@ m of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in Of@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen is lifted and also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg again has again made the traffic conditions within the village .
the citizens can now drive from Of@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the sof@@ ter through the place seems to be return .
&quot; since there were some significant complaints , &quot; says the executive director Florian King , responsible for the transport @-@ related management of the renov@@ ations .
the natives of Bach@@ s road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , o@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many s@@ ne@@ sts were looking away and rather than their Nav@@ i trust in the sign@@ age .
what do it led to man@@ cher trucks in housing areas .
as the speed limit does not comply with the limit of measuring instruments , the church are strengthened from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; there was considerable transition , &quot; says King , who himself made himself in front of the location on the location .
there are two to three per minute drive .
the Schnell@@ ste was on the road at 77 km / h in the tempo @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has been moved , but it became a quiet .
for business craftsmen at the B 27 , it is only a small Tro@@ st , that is now open to customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg as the road again .
in the maps we do not have any business meetings .
but that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment with them to grow in this growth , everyone who asks you ask , look back .
however , some more and some less are affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who has to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; End@@ less &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. for other companies , the refurb@@ ishment has hardly any consequences .
also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most slight decline , &quot; but was also a clear that of course , &quot; the Lauf@@ enburg was missing . &quot;
on the strongest ge@@ aring , the Local along the road .
J. Albert G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds significant words .
this is already exist@@ ent .
not only him , but all guest places made it &quot; hard . &quot;
there were missing customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we have to be happy about every euro .
the net sales rose to &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
the inter@@ course was thrown into operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
the half of his employees have to be released .
if I have got a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been released , the policy would be different .
instead , Mayor Jörg Schmidt , President Jörg Schmidt could give one financial statements on request of G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER , if there is a financial statements , otherwise by the benefits of the location at the B 27 . Now , they would also be able to contact the re@@ parts required by the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER will be white from other coun@@ ties , where something generous is handled .
with all cl@@ agen , G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER is sure that its guest facilities will continue to pass .
finally , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , he also refers to the long history of history .
that other regular items are now able to escape less often in fact , it can be understand due to the complicated traffic management .
if you don &apos;t drive , it is also different .
that , G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER does not return to the end of the refurb@@ ishment , G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER is no doubt any doubt .
despite the crises with BSE and the bir@@ ths , G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER holds the impact of the B 27 construction on its client for the largest crisis that has experienced its guest facilities in their long history .
six months of construction work , which is already brut@@ alized .
constantly , in the name of the terrorist act of laws .
after the recent attack , the Minister of the Interior de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick security package .
but what has a Dul@@ ce status with terror ?
and what says the Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner to all the ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Vers@@ öh@@ ner .
all of his suggestions regarding the coalition partner &quot; politically zum@@ ut@@ eable , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new safety sp@@ ak@@ ets .
you would like to challenge anyone .
others , further points would be discussed within the parties .
I also recall me .
but the Minister of the Interior came to him on the results and on a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able K@@ ON@@ SEN@@ S &quot; within the Coalition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , before he presents his conclusions for the safety in the Republic .
however , these are all the more extensive .
some is already known , announced that there is a new safety authority to take care of the child , is not new .
even the fact that Germany must use several EU standards on flight data and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities also does not surprising .
in the part of Mai@@ zi@@ ère , Mai@@ zi@@ ère started a second stop for suggestions which have so far won by the SPD : he wants to hold sympath@@ y for terror groups of punishment , and jihadists with double @-@ citizenship in German Pass .
&quot; the &quot; difficult points &quot; will be difficult for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is still working for zum@@ ut@@ able and challenging nothing , what do not have a chance at the Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner .
a few new ideas presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have been partially in : it is planning fast procedures for demo@@ li@@ tions and more possibilities to resol@@ ving people in front of the deportation .
refugees to be targeted at the land in advance , must leave their smartphones and use social media action for a security check .
for the previous asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to use worse than so far - about such that endeav@@ or to go into action or do their papers in order to wear their identity .
some of them is politically and legally hei@@ r .
man@@ ches also acts un@@ locked and can open questions .
and in some points - in the ine@@ line treatment of patient , for example , the question : what has actually to do with safety and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differential between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it &apos;s not possible to speak in the speech that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg .
in addition , many people made in view of the high number of refugee concerns around the safety .
and things that met the people in profound employment , also did not cl@@ amps again in the poll@@ ing times .
the inner safety is enorm@@ ously in the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the locking is big .
and yes , there are voting competition .
Union and SPD are becoming increasingly important in position on the subject of internal security .
in the past days there went between the two parties .
it was only a gar@@ den@@ ger war on the equipment of the Federal Police , then a certain Uni@@ ons of the Interior Minister , in which the hosts became a Bur@@ ka @-@ Ban and a return of double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is spra@@ yed here to con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
from a return of double pass , he is nothing .
we met the discussion in Germany .
you restart , do not be sensible .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban on the constitutional law .
whether his own package is un@@ sealed on all corners , and whether it is actually &quot; zum@@ ut@@ ably &quot; for the Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner , it must be only possible .
it is a lot of it that could provide for war .
however , the SPD tries to pro@@ filed with the theme of internal security .
Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized it to be careful , and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything to talk about everything that will continue to raise safety . &quot;
Volkswagen still comes Volkswagen g@@ lim@@ p .
despite diesel fuel , the delivery costs worldwide .
but in all markets it runs round .
in the review action there is a term for the term action .
Volkswagen starts for deliveries of deliveries in the second half @-@ year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ breaking markets , Europe can continue to increase its diesel engines due to its many brands and some well @-@ held markets .
but in July the core brand , VW , above all in Western Europe and were able to achieve the total sales , such as the company in D@@ ax , listed in D@@ ax .
the brand was sold worldwide in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales grew 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market of Germany , the deliveries around nearly one hex@@ a .
brand @-@ owned company Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the we@@ aker numbers in July , above all , on two sales days in Europe .
in addition , it has been given in some core markets through &quot; changed economic environment &quot; in some core markets .
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey also the British vote on the exit , explained an spokesperson on the exit .
in the US , where the exhaust gas hydr@@ ates first ki@@ ali@@ ated , there is also a Min@@ us , too .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the most affected house of Lower Saxony will continue to be relatively stable by diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , merely an extradition minus 0.9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles were compared to the first seven months .
group sales division Fred Kap@@ pler was able to continue to follow up from January to July further .
some 1.3 percent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen in this period , 5.@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a passenger tests .
in Germany alone , VW , approximately 2.5 million carri@@ ages call for arm@@ ament in workshops .
in the course of the upgrade , VW , that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
according to the upgrade of vehicles the vehicles will give it fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or motor performance no wor@@ sen@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motor@@ cycles of the clients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not by a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was in the company &apos;s decision on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason are legal fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports , Volkswagen granted its German customers , now a guarantee for improved diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed on Monday VW @-@ Represent@@ atives to the federal ministry of the State Department .
from the Ministry of Agriculture , it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editions of my research Commission and the KBA &quot; &quot; &quot; has to fulfil the editions of my In@@ qu@@ iry Commission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of them are not accepted , &quot; says the Federal Minister for Minister Alexander Dob@@ rin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry of Education .
VW has taken over the guarantee that by fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or motor performance in upgra@@ ding to upgrade , and all typical levels of relevant vehicles have been unchanged .
Volkswagen themselves uses the term &quot; guarantee , &quot; but not as it was in business trips .
in the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; provides Volkswagen the ability to set up some half a year after upgra@@ ding around a workshop - and this will lead to the new software , even if the damage could do nothing to do anything .
it is important to avoid damage even in the customer &apos;s inter@@ section , it is definitely not to do any damage to do anything with the sc@@ andal caused by any possible warranty , as it was the name of it .
that &apos;s why the term &quot; guarantee &quot; is not .
the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen &apos;s G@@ mund reaches the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see remains of rich austerity - as the second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily cas@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and sees there no signal : normal austerity would have to be afraid , &quot; not fear for their savings bank . &quot;
camps banks pay money through night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay its 0.4 percent sentence .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen database G@@ mund from September of Private and corporate customers for deposits in excess of 100,000 euros to Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily cas@@ hl@@ ets .
the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will be around 400 euros in the year &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he be@@ ware for more than 40 million euros , that could be raised from one day on the other , and that he could not understand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the central banks and cause 0.4 percent of costs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bank boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so &quot; I can not put up for every million 4000 euros . &quot;
the costs will be in accordance with the principle of principle .
the cash is simply to be in the Tres@@ ot@@ ors of the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen database , would have much too dangerous : &quot; I had already experienced four over@@ lay , I don &apos;t remember the fifth ! , &quot; said the banking sector .
most customers would have understanding and changed rarely to other investment forms .
only few migr@@ ated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bavarian Association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course for ECB causes significant costs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all banks significant costs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you alone have to wear alone , be &quot; business @-@ efficient not possible . &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for con@@ tours , credit cards or transfers .
with criminal interest rates for deposits from three million euros , the Thurin@@ gian - and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen saw Alten@@ burg country with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch branch in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive leader of the financial officer , said : &quot; we don &apos;t expect private customers to pay for deposits to be paid for deposits , this is the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said , &quot; T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see it is &quot; a cli@@ ck@@ el that is equipped with a somewhat luxuri@@ ant water . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this can be used for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they have free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the Gen@@ ut@@ ational bank G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ igh@@ ter , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region , well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; currently , there are no further banks known that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the Federal Association of the German national banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared : &quot; the threshold , to which Negative Negative replacement , is very high , very high . &quot;
the competition was hard , and it dro@@ pping the migration of anarch@@ ism to the competition .

Dest@@ ination boards : who purchases important sound boards ?
all men do not love with middle @-@ age boards .
before you go to the commentary box to over@@ flow him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ dop@@ ed male age , this statement leads from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the adv@@ ancement of sound boards do not want to focus on a boom in Mill@@ enni@@ als that would like to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects , but on Mid@@ life No@@ stal@@ gia .
those who have recently purchased a plate , are all predi@@ ctions according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely K@@ äu@@ fer@@ ous group .
it is also no hormon@@ es by plan@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older record players keep their feelings rather for ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but vote on the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog , a news report would follow me , while I would follow the camera , while I go out in a bu@@ stling road in the Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit , and my hands hold , my hands hold , and somewhat wor@@ rying , as : &quot; so , let &apos;s be looking for a great view . &quot;
so , let &apos;s throw us a look at .
even if the heart of So@@ os were slow down to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices , the building that once had an independent seller - there are also independent seller - there are a handful of fantastic turn@@ tables .
I would be the camera to ask the camera to switch the camera to the next part , where I understand , in the immediate proximity to various men , such as shops , try to estimate their age and vegetables through observation .
Stuart , Glasgow , 55 , from Si@@ ster Ray ( data number : eight young women , three men @-@ age ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight young women , one woman , probably around the 20 ) follow , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through business to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , question I ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 sheets .
this sound plates , above ( he sent me the sn@@ ap@@ se by e @-@ mail , I am not yet home ) where the walls can be used .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy @-@ it , when he appeared , and once again purchased objects that he sold it , when he was young and ple@@ aded .
&quot; many things that I buy , are out of the late 60s , early &apos; 70s , which was released , when I was 11 or 12 . things that I was probably young to buy me , &quot; says he says .
it is true that those who buy the plates buy , rather an independent time and add it alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t do , and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my L@@ aster .
We@@ z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers that he meets , on the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback , and to buy themselves again to buy their old sheets again .
of the talks who I have led , people usually managed to emp@@ tied in 1998 or 1999 in their collection .
customers who once sold their records sold to buy CDs , sell now their CDs to buy themselves again , &quot; says he says .
this would explain the boom on the battle of a certain age .
but what is the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to recognize that record stores offers a cal@@ ming community of equality .
according to We@@ z , some of the older customers expect to contact the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans have been overwhel@@ med by the digital world , and want to go to the stability of confi@@ dential Schall@@ platten@@ ls , of objects that call a happy youth memories .
&quot; I think it can sometimes be the filling of a sh@@ ere or possession of material owners as a kind of Tro@@ st , &quot; says We@@ z .
that is with me as collectors and I think it is so many people such .
it is a simple way to employ mentally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; fl@@ es become a staff of one record table .
a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a plate bought a plate they haven &apos;t heard .
the survey found that 41 % have a turn@@ tables that never use them , while 7 % of those who buy a plate , no turn@@ tables .
at that time of Intelligence , I would probably look very wor@@ ried , while I would like to come to Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations by a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Sco@@ tia .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works with sounds of the Uni@@ verse ( data number : three men @-@ age ) , has a &quot; trop@@ hy @-@ effect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone came in just recently here and said , &quot; I have no turn@@ tables , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead Schall@@ platte , so I &apos;d expect it to Reg@@ al . &quot; he says .
this is not a great percentage , but it happens definitely .
more productive high , less musi@@ kl@@ as@@ tig .
we have people who say , &quot; I don &apos;t have any turn@@ tables . &quot;
these are younger people , not older which come only slowly .
F@@ opp , which dedicated to the sound boards almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience , when I go .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists , photos make , teenagers and women in medium age .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the pre @-@ standing shops , Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest syn@@ thesizer and sounds from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such a diversity in customers .
none of them can be seen son@@ ly , but the brand psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to handle , if one stands for someone 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs in business since some minutes in business and viewed the variation on the sale .
it &apos;s rather a display bum@@ ps than a large one @-@ buy .
they don &apos;t deser@@ ves much , hence the collector of plates are no real option , it says .
it costs too much .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from a computer or on other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a lovely s@@ eu@@ f@@ zer .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business whose name is said to have inspired you to have a new generation of record players : Urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the answer the je@@ ans Hot@@ p@@ ants to mu@@ sters , a group of young teen@@ agn@@ ers that are group@@ ed for a moment to buy Polar@@ oid cameras , before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a cros@@ ley turn@@ tables .
on the left , a stair@@ way , a wall full of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classic , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one sees them - maybe because they are only pure decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to specify them .
it is pure &quot; Platten@@ kunst . &quot;
but in view of that , any attraction for these objects are more money for the industry , and some customers could send in the depths of So@@ th@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , that is the one that &apos;s most for luxury objects such as plates .
even if my research studies show that the results of You@@ Go@@ v they vote , at least in turn@@ tables in Soh@@ o , the great number of female collectors and turn@@ around , which exist in reality , record shops and online shops .
these people are probably working hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety not by turn@@ out of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they are driving a un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er that looks on the shoulders of the shoulders of all the middle age .

French court ruling on the end of shops in the jungle refugee camp .
a French court has rejected a bid of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional stores and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , thousands of refugees living in thousands of refugees .
in a trial , these week argued that the state should be able to ri@@ pping 72 provisional stores within those of the camp &apos;s goods , selling cigarettes to Ener@@ gy@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ s and tea for 50 cent ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be destroyed , because they would have a parallel economy would be paid , from which no taxes would be paid for tax and food risk .
humanitarian groups shared out the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals that are offered by state @-@ supported association and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in stock .
in addition , they led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there is no legal basis for the expulsion of people , who run the 72 provisional stores , but dre@@ amed that the concerns of the Pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; absolutely re@@ tra@@ vers@@ able . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes , and restaurants would play a much bigger role , as merely people live , who live in extreme pre@@ operative conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers offer .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany R@@ aser must set up on the next generation of speed limit : in different federal states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the Tem@@ pos@@ h of particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement of the Company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on the accident , where there is a mobile measurement through the police .
for example on highway construction sites or to refurb@@ ishment bridges with temporary paper , there are often no needed infrastructure to ensure the speed limit of speed limit for speed limit .
a permanent mobile setting , however may be dangerous or bad .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is aut@@ ark : its battery holds five days , the case data can be encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded at the same time .
variable speed limit , and drive @-@ speed after time , drivers strip and vehicle class can also monitor .
in the high @-@ end state , one can move the trailer according to the manufacturers with a trailer hook .
in order to make it easy , it is lowered by the knife , so that the wheels will disappear in the ge@@ aring and by the way to disappear .

great Britain : silver in 7 @-@ he Ru@@ g@@ by , after the Fiji Master@@ class gold .
the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening in the form of fi@@ j@@ is in the form of fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated by 43 @-@ 7 at De@@ odor@@ o Stadium here in Rio .
Fiji is a master class in the handling , side @-@ Step@@ ping , back @-@ up , scheduled and rotating power to win gold - their first Olympic Games in any color .
the defeat was sent by the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation of the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth on this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals of the same day might be returned to them in the final day .
but ir@@ respective of them are defeated by this form a 15 @-@ man team in the best form .
it might be a drum - but it is likely not - that at least a Br@@ ite morning have a gold medal by his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is editor Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wimble@@ don .
GB had a difficult walk behind .
eight years ago , she lost Ryan each game at the Adel@@ aide Sev@@ ens .
here they only lost one thing .
this cap becomes we@@ h@@ tun , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji began wonderful and left the attacks G@@ BS by Sp@@ ass .
it felt like the captain Tom Mitch@@ ell and Co . an when one would run into driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 according to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner .
at the same time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i started another attack on the right corner from the right corner of Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i .
12 @-@ 0 and GB has hardly captured the ball .
a pre@@ operative T@@ ack@@ le of Mitch@@ ell stops the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa at the third gate , but it has become Fiji only .
in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua the right corner is a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still a minute play@@ time ... in the first half of the ...
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ ends through more weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion was a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is so that Fiji was born to play 7 , while the GB still is still on .
it is also possible .
GB resulted in basic changes to half @-@ time period and completed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for whole four minutes , what ran for the ratios of the first half time , up to Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji .
Dan N@@ orton started trying to get a touch @-@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game had already been in favor of the south @-@ border , whose fans s@@ worn , tra@@ ckers , and danced to the tri@@ pod .
it was not difficult to admire Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s playful approach .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame put the i @-@ bag with a further experiment in the last seconds .
the Pfi@@ ff@@ ert , the fi@@ j@@ is im@@ pover@@ ished and GB ki@@ cked down in the lawn .
earlier on the days , Fiji are defeated in the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain , in a cris@@ p@@ y match from the race - Great Britain conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half of the front , but Dan N@@ orton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and achieved a gate among the post in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kl@@ ing of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ th teams , secured the profit and therefore the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning by combat with the cancer of the rowing victory

even though it was only the passenger who were sitting in the boat , there were three voices in the boat . he was present at the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in two without a control woman in a row , the first women in the history of the British Sports in which they were in a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least her 3@@ 9,@@ ter un@@ cated use , which is also exemplary .
what we see , two brilliant Ath@@ os , who lead over the surface with the elegance of pigs , which does not reflect the way of the Tri@@ umph@@ es .
behind every Gold , a batt@@ ali@@ on of wild hel@@ pers , who account the difference , and it was no means that no one of the coach who had not knew 30 months ago , if he had diagnosed this day when cancer was diagnosed .
he said , he said to ris@@ k@@ ant .
I had bladder cancer , which is operated and did it .
if you do not do it , spread all over .
it would have been a quite f@@ lim@@ iting situation .
it changed a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio , luck was that he could start the treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , so the inter@@ ruption was held on a minimum , if that could be the right term under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better again .
it was an incentive gi@@ ve@@ away .
I was at the hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet , 30 foot , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
it begins .
the herds to itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger .
in the integrity of the victory , her first thoughts about Williams , who spent a ner@@ ed up in the morning , so he spent some more than else , trying to handle his own change .
St@@ anning , who served as a cent@@ uri@@ on in the Royal Arti@@ llery suggested in Afghanistan in Afghanistan , &quot; I was a emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it is repeated , how much I mean that , how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin would we have no one , so there &apos;s a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I have no better person to check or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up with their opponent .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark took close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had much in Reserve .
we were very caught in the moment .
Helen called &quot; back to the process , lasting in the process . &quot;
it is really important to be ri@@ pping away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not able to make something special T@@ oll@@ es .
we wanted to do not a fire@@ works , we wanted to get a good result , go out and the race win what we did .
the pair will take place for a year , before it will meet decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week in a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I don &apos;t wanted to say that my last race was my last race .
this would have been a lot of pressure .
in London there lasted approximately six months to realize that I am a Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so troubled .
it took about four minutes .
that &apos;s feels so much better , &quot; said she said .

&quot; I am really happy about that , after two years , we were finally able to meet negotiations after two years . &quot;

according to the German industry industry , additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the W@@ AZ , it is now an agreement with the EU Commission after talks with the Com@@ miss@@ arin Mar@@ gre@@ the Vest@@ as .
only if the generators used in the steel plants will be replaced , f@@ use an E@@ EG lev@@ y by 20 percent .
but this will not be collected in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement in Germany with the EU Commission to own stro@@ ma generation .
thus , the status of the previous regulation will be largely de@@ written .
special significance was the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
regarding our campaign , &quot; steel is the future &apos; is that a first step . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to follow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

community , Spirit , Health : sing Sen@@ iors
the S@@ ingen , Ur@@ sel has accompanied their whole life : as a young girl was in the school choir , in the Leh@@ ra@@ mt @-@ study , they took the subject of Music , and today he sings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a Sen@@ iors Choir .
&quot; sing me - emotional and physically seen , &quot; she describes me .
after a rehear@@ sing , they feel free , cheer@@ ful and a total of life , she says .
she does not work something good in her health and their spirit .
because S@@ ingen is equal to several perspectives for a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior liga .
the sen@@ iors in the choir , and share with equ@@ est@@ ates the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
by regular connections , social contacts can build and maintain .
because often , social and family structures are in the age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience also has made the Ur@@ sel ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to discuss and organise the other one , another choir is a very special form of awareness . &quot;
sing in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler explains .
exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly calls his lungs regularly , also in everyday life not as fast as the pu@@ ste .
even if it comes to the sound of the voice in the age , S@@ ingen is an optimistic hobby .
for older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , say Ursula L@@ enz , by the federal community of the Sen@@ iors organizations .
in the older generations , the common S@@ ingen had a much higher position , it belonged to the everyday life , both in the school and in the leisure time .
L@@ enz seen often that the S@@ ingen or listening of songs in older people , many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
by song contex@@ ts and especially tunes even den@@ oun@@ ce people in long @-@ flying events .
in S@@ ingen , the head does not require a special performance , explained L@@ enz .
at the same time , at the same time , at the same time , the rhythm would focus on a given rhythm and to adapt the other singers , that is a major cognitive challenge .
just older people , living alone , practice , practice , not only focus on himself .
another positive aspect is the recognition that you can get through the S@@ ingen in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler , said H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em is growing up with the S@@ ingen in the choir .
themselves : if I have long been for something ü@@ be , I &apos;ll have better and w@@ aking up over me - this experience strength@@ ens .
good reasons to start with the S@@ ingen , so there is enough .
if you want to try out a new hobby , it should not hesitate to have little talent to have little talent .
one sings are not alone - with 50 sin@@ ts people who h@@ ears there , if there is a sound like this ?
on the search for the matching offer , various ways , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sings someone from the friend in a senior ench@@ y@@ or , one can easily be easily connected .
many cities also offer over@@ views over the cho@@ irs in the area .
who like to sing in a church choir , would like to sing directly to the church or the Church &apos;s Church .
many senior ench@@ y@@ ors are also about the internet .
if you don &apos;t have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbors have to ask the help of the Internet .
he who want to sing , should definitely make a choir to connect H@@ ac@@ kler .
sing , the soul is well and has a somewhat un@@ lock - this is true for each age .
cats react sensi@@ bler as k@@ ater on Schre@@ ie the young
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hannover , which effect the ru@@ gs of cat gas has grown on adult animals .
in their surprise , the male didn &apos;t leave the males too cold - but in contrast , they always kept in the difference to the females always .
female cats may recognize the reg@@ ression of cat @-@ ab@@ ys on the Mi@@ dd@@ les of the little .
they react to Lau@@ rence of k@@ itt@@ ens , who are in great need , as scientists from the medical association of the University of Hannover and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) were found .
cas@@ ings are also react to the ru@@ fe by k@@ itt@@ ens - but the same time .
&quot; apparently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the acoustic differences between the Mi@@ sts of less and strongly reg@@ ained young , for the males either not det@@ ach@@ able or not by meaning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ olog@@ ation in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is first known in the study which was published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ isti@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team already found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ Schre@@ yer with the drum@@ ming of their Hil@@ fe@@ ws .
in total , nine adult K@@ ater and eight cavi@@ ties were observed from the MH@@ H .
you were played for a little bit , which were taken for three minutes from the litter , and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
to the other , they were confronted with the write of stronger k@@ itt@@ ens , which were also highly stressed .
the researchers hold their results in spite of the small sample for sufficient sample .
&quot; all females , even the men that had not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted by the Schre@@ ie , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they rotating faster to the speakers , when this call@@ ers played at very much lighter k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be born or create a development with sexual inter@@ course .
&quot; a surprise that the male did not re@@ acts , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist .
in the past , scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men in baby noise .
some studies show that women are sensitive for babies who would like to have ten mothers , even if they were mothers or not , reported the Bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .

this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man in the world .
I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer &apos;s design , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athletes were detected using so many medals .
so T@@ ich@@ on lost its world championship title from 2005 nine years later , after Test@@ oster@@ one dop@@ ing was determined .
in the meantime , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to fight against ster@@ oid @-@ dop@@ ings and the EM @-@ title in 2006 due to test@@ oster@@ one abuse .

Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ prising in Thailand - Austrian was injured - multiple dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand , with the woman in contact , said the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
they suffered a stroke , and have been treated at the hospital , but I have already left the hospital .
her home trip she planned for the beginning of September .
whether further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on also became Austrian citizen , is still un@@ clear .
the Department of Foreign Affairs in order to contact with local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
around 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a Nightlife , two bombs .
according to police , a Thai woman was killed and killed around 20 people , including the Austrian , three German , three Dut@@ chman and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning , two sp@@ oo@@ thing again went up again , according to the authorities another man , according to the authorities .

in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another Bom@@ b , killing a municipal staff .
according to the authorities in a flower in front of the Re@@ four of the coastal police in the air .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the Southwest coast , as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast , several wounded .
you go from one connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was the name of it .
&quot; the bomb attack also bear the same manuscript , &quot; stated armies General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday evening before journalists .
&quot; we go out that it is a coordinated attack . &quot;
it was too early to sell to the possible modes - probably a replacement for the deeds of Muslim rebels .
also Thai media wanted to recognize the attacks on the attacks a pattern that is typical of the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
in contrast , the Thai police stated that the attacks were not in connection with an Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; that is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok .
it may be assumed that the bombs of the ruling military j@@ unta were placed .
the authorities have been maintained in the past days of reference to the upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact date and the places .
still un@@ clear , the group behind the attacks range .
the police increased their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and amusement parks .
in Thailand there are still smaller bomb attack , but they were mostly not against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace , which was used by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hu@@ mi@@ el Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .

high safety risk ( safety level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ et and its surroundings .
according to the conflicts between security forces and Muslim populations , not the necessary trips to these provinces were dem@@ ol@@ ished .
increased safety risk ( safety level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday was a few days after a controversial referendum on a military tribunal of the military j@@ unta .
this spatial influence was also reflected in the next few years .
Jun@@ ta @-@ Chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ cha , bom@@ bers are an attempt to sti@@ cking chaos while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
the military unta which had reached power in 2014 after a phase of bloody ri@@ ots , himself holds a good opportunity to bring the Kingdom to stability and order .
however , it is not succeeded in the military to get the military uprising in the extreme south of the country for years .
in the conflict already more than 6500 people were killed .
almost a year ago in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ Sch@@ rein 20 people had been killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; Identi@@ t@@ ance Movement &quot; is prop@@ elled to the visionary of the Federal Office for constitutional protection .
after several nation@@ alities , the constitutional protective in the Bund have made the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; movement for efforts against the freedom of democratic party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the immigrants of Islamic Faith or the Middle East are diff@@ use diff@@ use diff@@ use in the Middle East .
therefore we observe the movement now .
the &quot; Identi@@ t@@ ants &quot; is a group of group@@ ing with French roots which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; an un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and &quot; loss of the own identity . &quot;
constitutional Compl@@ er in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - watch the &quot; identification &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said his authority was closely matched in the decision closely with the state &apos;s decision .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ t@@ aries &apos; try to pick up their target groups , where it stands , &quot; said the constitutional Compl@@ aints . &quot;
generally try wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , they with adol@@ es@@ cent music , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the daily Isla@@ mi@@ sts as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is no bet@@ u@@ sive advertising for their own thing .
the propaganda should be emotional .
young people are here in particular ways .
this is dangerous .
recently , there was a report from several federal states concerning contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ t@@ ary &quot; to Af@@ D @-@ Political .
Ma@@ ate said he had no knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , the potential contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point .
it comes to whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain people that changes their destination , changes their destination .
so the decisive factor is , whether such individuals have an influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
looking to the significant increase in rights motivated by law and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee accommodations , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak in this context not by a new right terrorism .
but we found it into the past years that it can be ri@@ ster@@ oid structures .
there was the Group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may be quite certain that further right @-@ wing group@@ ings or small groups that form attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee sh@@ ei@@ me or attacks out of other right @-@ wing Mo@@ tives .
a clear or pan @-@ European control of rect@@ angle is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups are made on regional level or in social network .
wor@@ ried about Ma@@ ate that many over@@ laps to the account of humans , which had not been in the right wing in the right wing .
this is the al@@ um@@ ption .
many of the Tat@@ ras at attacks on asylum was not known as a criminal , politically active , or trailer on the right scene .
so many people have committed crimes committed before that in the right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , they were politically un@@ different , or for example , CD@@ U , the SPD or left , who then do not have their right @-@ right mo@@ ist mo@@ ist . &quot;

this is distributed in order to make swimming in several countries .
most athletes run in branches , wanted to run most athletes , I wanted to make something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros is ready for the big race .
quickly , the first nick@@ name took the round .
some media recorded him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of W@@ al . &quot;
in compliance with a &quot; Wohl@@ gem@@ s , &quot; the English Bou@@ lev@@ elling &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made him fun .
his time he was first played with a minute and almost five seconds on the 100 meter Fre@@ isti@@ l , there was no part .
the same with &quot; Eric the E@@ EL &quot; were also pulled .
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i made attention to attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the s@@ qu@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meters Fre@@ isti@@ l .

the charges per cubic meters of water will take place from October 1 , 2016 for the area of sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 Euro ; for Zul@@ u / Linden@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 euros ( previously : 2.@@ 26 Euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( previously 2,@@ 18 euros ) .
at the complex in Az@@ endorf , the sewage fee will be at least once again , if appropriate development measures are necessary .
after a long distance calculation , the sewage price will lie in Az@@ endorf at 4,@@ 37 euros per cubic meters .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported that the approval of the budget was determined by the agricultural office of Kul@@ mbach showed that san@@ itation systems have been burnt down .
on the market , Kas@@ endorf was obliged to operate and operate the facilities .
from October 1 , 2016 , citizens and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Linden@@ berg and Zul@@ u will have to attack deeper in the pur@@ se .
the fee increases lie between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman Manager Herbert Schmidt was presented to the panel , a new version of charges for wast@@ ew@@ ater of the market assembly was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 are also over@@ - and sub@@ covers from the previous Kal@@ kul@@ ation period .
the gra@@ zing mechanism increased , so that it is possible to fly on all three sewage plants , with a very small sewage fall , which fly between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
thus , due to the low distribution basis for example , the expenses for repairs of several thousand Euros is carried out .
moreover , the sewage plant was reduced slightly in all three plants .
furthermore , in the out@@ crop @-@ period period of all three plants did not least last due to their age , refurb@@ ishment and repair costs in a considerable extent .
the complex in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Zul@@ tenberg , Linden@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the sewage plant Az@@ endorf had to be replaced with mechanical ventilation system due to a damage .

Schmidt : &quot; in this extraordinary expenditure , the integration of care and maintenance costs came to be taken into consideration in the new calendar period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which is still clearly below the current level in the previous years 2011 / 2012 .
Stein@@ häuser made clear that in the small sewage fall into the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
moreover , Schmidt , the market community of big entertainment costs over the sewage plant in the past 20 years has remained spar@@ ed .
the situation concerning these plants will continue to remain in view of stone cottages to the duration , especially as the supply area of the sewage plant of Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al will not be expanded to expand these systems since it is possible to make public facilities .

Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as asian carto@@ ons
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter anim@@ e is inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is un@@ sensitive to races .
with his filter tool , it enables sn@@ ap@@ ologi@@ an about 150 million daily users , to change the reality , and with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the Ab@@ sur@@ de borders .

Sn@@ ap@@ chat filter have been carried out in the past , in which they were accused that the app Black@@ face con@@ vey@@ ors or white skin would act as a beauty activity .
when these week , some users struck a filter pre @-@ put them , the false teeth and a dark@@ er w@@ angen , called for a ri@@ f@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ans - &quot; brass . &quot;
they asked if these repeated contro@@ ver@@ sen repeated on a larger problem that the company has entrusted with diversity .
the messages and the indi@@ gn@@ ation were widely used on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and motherboard , one day after sn@@ ap@@ ity release that it would have enabled the feature .
the company offered a resolution : the filter was as an homage to Ani@@ ma characters and not as cartoon by Asi@@ ans .
but exterior re@@ viewing the rac@@ ism , reminded the filter of viol@@ ating cl@@ ums@@ y .

in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose role has been spread far beyond the photos that the filter &quot; viol@@ ate and gel@@ in@@ de did un@@ pleasant . &quot;
it added , it was difficult to argue that &quot; it would be difficult to argue with the counter@@ act of a very substantial Asian carto@@ ons and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not successful , but that the yellow @-@ plated brass was pulled back into the way .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only enterprise that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ dra@@ tion .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , &quot; conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we keep all in the hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are different from the race , they are more than their older counter@@ parts - could expect more than that of these things are expected to expect .

the company has no figures to diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday there are sn@@ ap@@ chat that discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokesperson , the company has recently hired a staff of personnel who focused on under@@ re@@ acting population groups and on internal integration .

Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; news information provided by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com was typically associated with high @-@ level Cent@@ Com for terrorism , as it allows the actual circumstances in front of the place , and were consistently positive than analyses of other news services , &quot; cited a newspaper article .
&quot; what is happening in Cent@@ Com , un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer from our political leaders , &quot; says Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , republi@@ can , member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
the leadership error in the Cent@@ Com should reach the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence to modify the government lines of Obama , it shows how analysts could have exposed to the pressure of their laws , an optimistic picture of the threat of Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press releases , opinions and testimon@@ ies before the Congress clearly showed positive than it the facts . &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com was publicly known that a military response was supposed to start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second @-@ largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , it is clear as much . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , republi@@ can Congress from Kansas , in a statement .
from the mid @-@ year 2014 until the middle of the year 2015 , the tips of the Central Command was change the news release concerning the risk by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after they were played , that analysts agree on the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report on Thursday released a report by detailed insights , while the investigations will be continued during the investigations .
in addition , additional investigations of Cent@@ Com was under@@ way through the general staff of the Ministry of Defence in progress .
democratic members of the Intelligence Service Committee published its own findings on Thursday with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can Task Force on Thursday .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com was a restricted process for the creation of renewable energy services , &quot; the highest standards council in the Comintern , is a member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. ship , in a statement .
this process , as Mr. ship , &quot; delayed the publication of inter@@ ruption in reports , &quot; says Mor@@ al under Analy@@ st and &quot; there were little space for different opinions . &quot;
but the ship and the Democrats stated that no evidence of the White House in the Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st with Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st is found on a certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigation by the general secretary of the Pentagon , that were recorded by Cent@@ Com &apos;s complaints by Cent@@ Com .
L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press pre@@ dic@@ tive to the Pentagon , gave to a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not be a reports for the investigations of the Con@@ tests .
but he also said that &quot; experts , sometimes quite certain opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the Ministry of Defence are the controversial discussion of this important topics of the national defense . &quot;
the investigations have a decision on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the debt of damages of last year , however , President Obama abandoned to the Central Bank for hon@@ our@@ able deposits in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State , in tongues over ten years ago , as the former government under George W. Bush , contrary to the recommendations of many analysts , looked at only a little time in Iraq and a little time on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker following the government of the government attacks against the Islamic State refin@@ eries no significant impacts on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as they had to sell these provisional refin@@ eries in order to sell oil on the Black@@ market .
this knowledge was not published , however , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ ight commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the Legis@@ lative Council for his excessive positive assessment of war crimes in a hearing before the Senate .

five goals in two games are actually a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever since .
&quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; she said .
I &apos;m afraid of the people who have their doors at the memory .

they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , as they did not qualify for the k@@ ader .
then came in 2012 , in which she went for her and her team .
the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , a Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and so that things started better for better .
&quot; a culture change , a mental change , and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we didn &apos;t work to work in London , which we now have .
we can ri@@ p the back@@ rest .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door@@ ke@@ gen in the first half of the game with a withdrawal from the Middle East .
India was without victory in the tournament , but the team showed a surprisingly tough and held the match of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left f@@ lange , then in the middle and lu@@ te the ball into the gate to the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in any of the previous games .
it has a run .
just as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on Saturday &apos;s outcome of the next game .

you can not listen to the television set , a newspaper or to listen to your neighbours in the coff@@ es@@ hop , without more than Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the battle between Michael P@@ and C@@ had le c@@ los .
and then there are Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games , and a women &apos;s black female di@@ m@@ ples , could have made it to the Prime time , was set up with sponsors and well @-@ looking @-@ TV commerci@@ als , when he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even fen@@ cer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the Olympic tramp@@ oline for gold .
the Olympic flame was lit not exactly any event .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not widely accepted : air@@ crafts arch@@ ery , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest and may be long @-@ proof .
but if I don &apos;t want to make the arguments for my specific lovers , then leave me the attention to the discre@@ et charm of the tramp@@ ol@@ ins .
although the tramp@@ oline is already a Olympic event since 2000 , when it was founded in Sydney , the last 16 years , it was perceived that many who had asked me , did not know that it was a Olympic Games at all .
this could also be regional Ign@@ or@@ anz .
although the USA athletes voted for competition , it has never won a medal in the tramp@@ oline jumping and won a athlete up until 2012 , who made it up until the end of 2012 .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadian for women to share women .
Dong Dong , China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the tramp@@ oline jumping tramp@@ oline has a certain out@@ si@@ ties , partially because it sounds suitable for the un@@ re@@ conn@@ aissance ear pass@@ ers@@ ed for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule as the Olympic Games sounds .
at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert but just a bit of enthusiasm .
it is humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ graph@@ er quot@@ ation of his never @-@ to @-@ end te@@ amm@@ ing - but also the gra@@ zie of the s@@ ens and diving , the two sports which is essentially un@@ ites essentially .
the word &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El tramp@@ oline , what is so much means as &quot; spr@@ ints . &quot;
asp@@ iring winner jump on a giant tramp@@ oline , shooting almost up to 30 feet in the air and must have a number of lack of movements ( thresh@@ ing , hail and sal@@ tos ) before putting them on your feet .
they will be evaluated according to the official Olympic Games , according to execution , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two hundred athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women are competing in Rio de Janeiro .
the common Olympic V@@ ector is straight ahead .
Me@@ da@@ ill@@ en@@ hoff@@ tes must further expand in its stre@@ ches to gold , faster , up to top and dr@@ over , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes , and back , down to the top and down on the playground .
you do not only hunt for the finish line or the output wall , but in television communication also a further height of the world : the world or the Olympic Games .
the targeted Stre@@ ets is no@@ bel , wonderful value , even fan@@ atic and it &apos;s enough to get even a spectators .
but it is also what I want to look at the chance of these games as a bit more fatigue .
the tramp@@ oline is offering a breathing for the tramp@@ oline .
the V@@ ector of the tramp@@ oline is top .
the target movement is not the target .
he or pr@@ all@@ t , apparently he@@ el@@ os like a astron@@ aut , goes down to top , then down to top , then down to the top .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no h@@ ec@@ tic attack on the target , no w@@ öl@@ ten in the he@@ ets , only the dre@@ ad@@ mitt@@ al , elegant re@@ vocation of time and gravity .
it is so Zen like the competition in the Olympics is only possible .
qualifying and end of women will take place on Friday in the Stre@@ aming around 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC becomes the final as part of an afternoon block to both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the middle of the Olympic Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who will probably see in general tumours .
if the awareness was achieved by the anxiety and the lenses , the male US Turner at the The Wall Street Journal , recently , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base to the air , the new fan base .
&quot; a Generation prot@@ otyp@@ ed &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a For@@ mer of the United States
forci@@ ble protests in Ethiopia
protest@@ ers , protest@@ ing political changes in Ethiopia are asked for a violent resist@@ or of the government .
witnesses say that , protest@@ ers were killed during h@@ uss@@ ers with the police at Sch@@ uss@@ ers .
is Ethiopia just try to break ?
over the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid balance of the West with a fast growing economy .
but in the last few months , protests against the government and carried out more areas in increasingly areas .
last week , thousands of people visited the streets and fundamental fundamental changes .
the answer of the government was un@@ noticed according to human rights organizations .
witnesses gave to witnesses that polic@@ emen were killed and killed armed forces .
in circulation , the videos across the protests , which are probably from the last or early of this year , such as security professionals young people with bum@@ ps , whereas these were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the Chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights requires an international investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this land , and the future will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is estimated to have the most populated country in Africa and its stability to Nigeria .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians together to combat terrorist attacks on the region , in particular in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , as much Western assistance .
Ethiop@@ ian economy continues to expand in a remarkable pace .
his infrastructure has dras@@ tically improved - there is a new media train in the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are normally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia had all other as a model for democracy , human rights organizations have been constantly increasing the suppression of the government - the Opposition in the country has been restricted to the silence .
many were sent into exile or prison , were killed or exp@@ elled into the desert of the desert .
however , this could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except prot@@ ested , it breaks out , &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation has been prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover all of the ground up to the saus@@ age of power in terms of power .
after a far @-@ reaching election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition and control now 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , ten@@ sions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this sh@@ aky , controversial line called for hundreds of life .
analyst who fear the separ@@ ati@@ sts , like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front , or the National Liberation Front , which were more or less than in the last years , the tur@@ bul@@ lets , and they might be armed .
several factors explain why feelings of the bit@@ ing after years before , H@@ ink@@ öch@@ el@@ ns are explo@@ de under the surface of the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in the last years , many Ethiop@@ ian is able to communicate via the social media , as a cheaper smartphones have always been more common and improved the Internet services improved .
even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , which they are in regular intervals , especially in the protests , so many people can communicate about the internet pro@@ xi@@ es which hide them .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave to them that they gathered themselves to protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest Eth@@ ics in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
since Ae@@ ons prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from a@@ edi@@ cs , mainly Christian High @-@ countries , in politics and economy , while they are exploited by the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and are living in shallow regions .
but that changes the changes .
&quot; we are going to coordinate with a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests were held in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia has dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which account for about 6 percent of the population , and that are dominant in the military , trade and politics .
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former Reb@@ ellen@@ ic , was up until his death in a non @-@ profit illness in 2012 , 17 years in Ethiop@@ ian prime minister .
he was seen as a tac@@ tic genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly suscep@@ tible to do with an early signs of accidents , and to use special instru@@ ct to make opponents too , and to make them un@@ harmful to opponents .
&quot; the current regime is missing at this fundament@@ als of this fundament@@ ally , &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict in conflict .
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively un@@ transparent reasons to re@@ take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
otherwise , Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the North of Ethiop@@ ian region of Ethiop@@ ians , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am from the South .
analysts say that he did not enjoy the trust of the ti@@ ray controlled security services .
many do fear that the result will be more bleeding .
the last time seen that Ethiopia has experienced a decision in 2005 after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , according to the analysis of the analysts at the government , which were stolen from the government .
while the following raid were killed , many prot@@ ested , even if there were less than in the last few months , and this time the rest was relatively fast .
development experts dro@@ pping Ethiop@@ i@@ ens leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , like the new Pend@@ ul@@ um infrastructure , as well as its meas@@ ur@@ able progress in the poverty line .
but obviously this is not the Inten@@ si@@ fication of the Ethiop@@ ian Government of Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
the last month of print prot@@ ested in gon@@ dar , an am@@ ese city , surrounded by Tig@@ ray , shops and hatred over the Tig@@ ray is increasingly commonly seen in the social media .
analysts say that the protests are protests in the US and other Western associations in a well @-@ like position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights on the neighboring Somalia , even if they recently concluded that the basis has closed this basis .
while the West clear the democracy wants to support democracy , he does not want to merge to become a vol@@ ati@@ te area in a already vol@@ ati@@ te area .
&quot; this , &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; says Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin Gr@@ at@@ est . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ um@@ explained his asser@@ tion Obama , that IS@@ IS was founded &quot; Sar@@ atov . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump also tried to disp@@ ers@@ ed his campaign by giving his campaign , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the &quot; founder of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously admitted .
this clarity the new questions concerning the communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans on whether he is able to communicate clearly and under@@ stand@@ able to communicate with the American public .
it also brings its competitors to take @-@ off him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , in which the owners position he could explain , that he might not receive .
after he made the acceptance of a election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ in relation to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and was in interviews that he really did not plan to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early mor@@ nings on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he is simple s@@ ark@@ as@@ table .
the role was the previous day to which Mr. Tr@@ ump in a number of interviews said he said the accus@@ ations entirely seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to destroy the statement that Mr. Obama wants to destroy that Mr. Obama wants to destroy the republi@@ can candidate nothing .
the last storm of criticism pr@@ ass@@ elt to Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ble , while he tries to drive the focus of his campaign due to power change@@ over values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ent and Mrs. Clinton held talking to the Economic situation in Michigan , this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ r tried again to return to this subject .
referring to Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ent has brought sar@@ asmus already in his defense .
at the end of July , he moved strong criticism , when he said , the Russians should have Mrs. Clin@@ ics E@@ mails , but he declared that &quot; Natural , &quot; I said the s@@ ark@@ as@@ table . &quot;
this method allows us to shift the linguistic boundaries in the policy and then go back to demand .
I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are absorbed by his fans , as they are arriving , and then as &quot; clear &quot; according to how the reaction will be . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication experts who observed the language of both candidates .
I think it is nothing else to keep his testimon@@ ies enough to keep enough , so they can be interpreted to different kind and way .
instead of the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted a yet ext@@ inc@@ ision of their clay .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leadership of large advantage over the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tried to do not ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ vocation , he is accused of having def@@ ective his critics , his statements or understand his hum@@ or .
but while he is strengthened the focus of attention in the past months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps sh@@ ear its loy@@ ed Mit@@ le@@ iter into the un@@ comfortable situation , ir@@ respective of it , as a prov@@ oking his statements also like .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps prominent advoc@@ ate , gave great effort to defend his candidate in CNN @-@ interview from Thursday .
&quot; I think what he says are legi@@ time , political comments , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani thus asked him to judge Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps asked if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
it is true that Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization that he called them back to the hinter@@ land , and that it was done , because he moved from Iraq .
the most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government has served as Secretary of State , IS@@ IS allowed it to be permitted to exp@@ orting it to the situation in the Middle East .
before the election campaign in Pennsylvania , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ped his attacks on the media and took over them before , on each of his words .
he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , j@@ unk &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t understand it ! &quot;
some of the Demok@@ rates sp@@ oil over Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps dis@@ b@@ ations are just a further evidence that he is not suitable for the Presi@@ dency .
once over the price from the market , Café in Green@@ point is back .
Ver@@ b Cafe was a fo@@ ol@@ oured café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay only able to pay no Wi @-@ Fi but spent 15 years in good coffee .
the price of course was ou@@ sted by the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ Front .
the business of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , replaced Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells Sei@@ fe in the form of Cup@@ cakes .
native city as the last loss in a gent@@ leman city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ tu wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is changing , but I can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b now is a Sei@@ fen@@ nel shop .
but if New York change is change , then it is also re @-@ fin@@ alised .
a re Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but has still some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
coffee is also still good .
Cisco Rodri@@ guez &apos;s new owner is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ time assistant of old cafés , owner and managing director of the new cafés .
he began work in Ver@@ b in 2001 , and remained there until the end .
as a customer , a customer offered to provide money for a new outside of the world , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept much in .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the Bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment his career .
he introduced new ingredients .
there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are Gar@@ ni@@ ings as cap@@ ers and s@@ auti@@ ously onions .
there are natural white dishes .
the café serves no beer more , there is fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he had a secured electricity to old tribal customers .
&quot; many old clients also were ur@@ ged by prices of Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was a great customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after having moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way to the route .
after the Ver@@ b closed , she gave a while the coffee , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that there was a lot of coffee and culture in the Ver@@ b culture , &quot; said she said . &quot;
now you drink coffee , even if they play on this day instead of their usual I@@ ced coff@@ ees a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long @-@ term and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and ordered un@@ soft di@@ pped .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , as a Swiss watch @-@ watch and prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he was experiment@@ ing and experiment@@ ing new ingredients into the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal will still get his usual order , but sometimes he will be his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he does not return to Gro@@ ll that the Sei@@ fen@@ business has taken over the old business area .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie has to produce a special soap for Ver@@ b with the c@@ ater coffee of cafés as an ingredient .
&quot; I think we &apos;re going to go on her offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
and the traditional , Polish residents Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has been translated into Polish and Rodri@@ guez , and Rodri@@ guez said that he has set out to feel it soon , so that its new neighbours looks welcome .
the location also has more advantages .
a local saf@@ et@@ ries would like to fill the c@@ ater coffee in bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the Café on an adjacent building is expanding .
for many customers , a new Ver@@ b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer , and said that he was destroyed on the ground , when the café finished in the ground .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ ose , he said that the subject of the loc@@ als , he felt a new coffee making it as a home country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the primitive food of the economic crisis in &quot; a successful meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to President Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch in the O@@ val Office .
as a Fein@@ schm@@ ecker , President Roosevelt created an institution for refined Del@@ ic@@ acies of the Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as , and Maryland waters .
his menu at this day was a somewhat modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato p@@ ü@@ ree and as dessert as dessert .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with biological people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights , and both are both food historian .
Co@@ es last book &quot; Ch@@ op Su@@ ey &quot; was the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ ck@@ man writes in their book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; on the lives in a residential building at the Lower East Side .
their latest cooperation , &quot; A @-@ permanent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per publishing house , will illustrate the history of American kitchen during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich shop on dinner , a small , snor@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em snack at Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the beginning of the stock market in 1929 .
Zi@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh produce with olive oil , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn was ate with potato p@@ ü@@ ree and vegetable juices .
when the Rep@@ orter of Hack@@ ney , this was the pair for a discussion about the food in the Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ag@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean @-@ bread .
they were made from an access and a cheap , which the access is carried out .
imagine , so many pe@@ an@@ uts have to eat so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E grin@@ ders .
&quot; it must have changed in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said .
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cook for male Fel@@ lowship and it was served fresh baked past@@ el for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
Americans were the Americans , who sent to hungry food in the first World War . &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; draws on the way to which the country went to become more the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland .
&quot; it was a time , in the food for the Americans a central , p@@ ann@@ eled theme , &quot; says Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write .
similarly , the new budget makes : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ ash@@ ollen have been raised to stap@@ le food , the c@@ asserole dish as a &quot; wonderful way , Ess@@ ence , &quot; as Kö@@ che un@@ app@@ raised ingredients under a cor@@ rug@@ ated sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheap dry dry .
meat , the years of the centre of the American kitchen was to become a rare servi@@ ced luxury .
out @-@ like mixing places were tried , as a cal@@ orie rich and nutrient instructions had been added to taste or even healthy kitchen .
during her research for the book , which also includes Reci@@ pes , Zi@@ ck@@ man made a court made of this epoch , baked onions and pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was no popular addition to the lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Zi@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit in each other .
it was typical for many of the su@@ c@@ eps .
as never before or ever before , bud@@ get@@ ing economic policy , including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the essence of the country has become good .
in newspapers and magazines published articles and articles published in newspapers and magazines , encouraging women to continue &quot; household : &quot; and the challenge , Pamp@@ e as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals .
&quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical treat .
in particular , the reports about the answer of the government to star@@ ving the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmhouse into his kitchen , he sp@@ ill like the million dollar man from the world , to whom he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in a nearly gil@@ ded dining room and contributed to a gift .
he was glori@@ ously real@@ ising .
President Roosevelt should have committed the same mistakes if not his wife , Ele@@ an@@ or said , would have encouraged him to stat@@ u@@ ary with his stomach .
as described in the book , the present day of a households with no interest in flavors , that the White House brought the boring food to Washington , but also one of the most frequently used food in Washington . &quot;
many of the types of the era of Great Depression , with food , was disc@@ arded as soon as the country came back on the legs .
the legacy is focused on our continued focus on calories and food , Zi@@ egel@@ man , and how science was applied .
the pair , gave me in the writing of the book out of Zi@@ ck@@ mans @-@ law in law better , - for example how they could not take away food .
&quot; she had a true fear of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
brick rec@@ alled : &quot; they made people actually ill . &quot;
there was the wind bag .
after the plate took place in Eis@@ enberg &apos;s plates , she moved and Co@@ e , and they made a dessert , that they had made at home : the pl@@ ums , the President Roosevelt at mid@@ day .
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ ck@@ man and added that it was a commonly called Tri@@ ck , modest recipes were to miss a nice name .
there was no deposit cream , pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
anyone di@@ pped a little ro@@ asted a spo@@ ons in the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not surprising .
Co@@ E brought three times a reproduction .
like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer he said to his wife , &quot; A couple of wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
the attacks of bombs was killed : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo .
he continued his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life in Syria .
he ris@@ ki@@ cked everything to save the lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died in a bombing raid of the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group that has so far managed to life over 60.000 people around 60,000 people .
29@@ 00 volunteers working their own life on the game to drag people from slaugh@@ tered houses and to make the first aid to the war .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil servants , which shows him in an 11 @-@ hour rescue from the ruins of a house , went to the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans to the bright symbol figure in the grey part of the war .
as a mighty man , he has never seen , said , &quot; said : &quot; for me is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; if I want to save life , I think that God looks to me a mart@@ y@@ rs . &quot;
shortly before Omar himself became a attack against the victims , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
the helicopter supplied four fac@@ ades about the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlorambucil .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath .
&quot; we now eliminate the toxic rem@@ n@@ ants of the Bom@@ b , that not children to play , &quot; quotes the picture his last words before he died .
the deadly Bom@@ be of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ tier is nearly 400 years old
common sight .
Greenland sh@@ arks come usually only in winter on the surface .
this Ha@@ i was allowed to return to an investigation on board of the field of S@@ anna to the sea .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and is s@@ wimm@@ ers with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to date .
Greenland got only with 150 years of age .
on the basis of the Greenland , the Greenland , at an hour he comes to an average of 1,@@ 220 metres far away .
only if it &apos;s a way , the five metre long animal acceler@@ ates on s@@ atte 2.6 km / h - and this speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this of long lon@@ el@@ iness , however , seems to be a sponsor@@ ship for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from a Greenland , which could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; W@@ ahn@@ mad@@ ness , &quot; commented on the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this li@@ fes@@ pan , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
indeed the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist already exists long that Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are old .
there is only lack of evidence .
Greenland &apos;s Greenland are badly damaged , they live above all in the Eis@@ meer - above the low populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because it prefer to temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they are diving at the surface usually only in winter .
about the Lifestyle of Greenland , researchers have a little bit little .
their time@@ pent@@ emp@@ o saw it , when they took six animals with a transmitter .
prey : in the stomach of a animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had sh@@ aded the pine bones of a young ice @-@ bears .
possibly ch@@ ase them sleep sleep or pat@@ rol on the basis of the ice me@@ eres and search Kad@@ aver that are out of higher water layers .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as co @-@ cat@@ ches of the North Atlantic .
the smallest Ha@@ i was just 81 centi@@ meters long , while the largest 502 centi@@ meters .
to determine the age of animals , analyzed them with carbon @-@ 14 method of Ha@@ ie .
this center of the ey@@ lin@@ se is already produced before the birth of Ha@@ ie , which are not renewed in it later .
the two smallest Ha@@ ie had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
its birth , therefore , according to the early 1960s , when nuclear experiments were larger quantities of the radioactive carbon in the atmosphere .
the third @-@ smallest animal contained in the lens of 220 centi@@ metres , contained a low over@@ pass to Carbon @-@ 14 in the nuclear power , it is likely to celebrated its 50th birthday at its 50th anniversary in 2012 .
all major Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie had the normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ quantities that produces the atmosphere by cos@@ mic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock was found for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland for an age of 335 years , while the record Ha@@ i with 502 centi@@ meters even is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Grön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only then got up , if they are longer than four meters , it was known .
now the researchers were able to re@@ viewing the length of the length .
because one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters are probably due to the threshold of sexual inter@@ course , and at the age of 156 , Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie became apparent for at least one @-@ a and a half centuries .
also this should be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that those meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live above all in e@@ isi@@ gen waters , is no coincidence .
even the previous record holder , an 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland , whose sp@@ eck was captured by a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ ons , was captured by Alaska .
by the low temperatures , often the body of the animals live on spar@@ se .
so tires later - and al@@ ant slow .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through the animal warmth .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than in one gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a small@@ ish animal lives in mind and should focus on to focus as much as much as possible , &quot; says the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ rub@@ bing . &quot;
a very big animal , however , should invest his resources rather in a long life .

the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took a anch@@ or@@ man who made his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y , who made it legend , and made it back home when he came home to a victory of the favor@@ ites New Zealand .
England won four years ago , a sho@@ cked victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic old@@ medals .
they repeated the tri@@ ck , after they played in March at the World Championships in London , despite the return of Ho@@ ys just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Chief of Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as execution .
Ho@@ ys retired from a gap that tried to tried by Ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton .
Sk@@ inner was the man where they stayed , when they saw potential in the car@@ rots , which has been un@@ folds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - founded four years ago with Ho@@ y si@@ sted - and Sk@@ ills were in the quali@@ fications round a Olympic athlete , but in the standard tables , the New Ze@@ el@@ tro took place in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
execution after his turn , but Kenn@@ y brought the team after the front and Sk@@ ills .
a strategy of strategic change made a huge part of the transformation , when it comes to a higher speed , to slow and keep it , and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert from his position as a BBC expert , and gave Sk@@ inner , password and Hin@@ des .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m only here to do my best and do a name .
we took place in the final round of the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord and the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the victory in 2012 on the side label and tes@@ ys , he was confident that he fell on the train after a weak start .
he moved this statement later and there was no obj@@ ecting of England &apos;s rival .
with so this time this time there was no problem for this time .
Hin@@ des said , &quot; it feels like the whole GB flags on the Tri@@ flush , as London . &quot;
we have come together in the last three months of the team .
we are so bad for so many World titles so bad , that it was incredible again to win the Olympi@@ ad in the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , who won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London .
when a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months is that we expect successful five days at Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form , it is in the area of possibility that he repeated the victory of three Olympics gold medals in a competition .
this would be for password - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( there were also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah , and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) , a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the scrip@@ tions of Ho@@ y is equal .
password is next to the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go over three days today .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I have felt this only for the moment . &quot;
the team Event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it &apos;s feels something to win alone .
Hin@@ des said , &quot; if he won two more gold medals , he should be beaten to k@@ nights . &quot;
it was the only Me@@ da@@ ill@@ en@@ competition of the day , but there was another good news for England .

the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competitors instead of Wig@@ gins with safety in the focus .

up to 2000 jobs in the complex of Al@@ co@@ a in Portland , Germany are available on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be endangered in a closure .
moreover , it could come to Domin@@ ic@@ effects , since the melting of the power is consumed about 10 percent of the total power generation Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ co@@ a completed the Point Henry Miller , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant in last year .
the melting of Al@@ co@@ a in Portland , loses their money and ris@@ ers a lock@@ ers .
this step follows the following years of spec@@ ul@@ ations regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melt with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three further owners will have their contracts .
the facility is located in the majority of a joint venture of Al@@ co@@ a and Al@@ um@@ ina , from which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant is still operated in Portland , Germany , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melting point , &quot; the company told the company .
AG@@ L said continues to continue the contracts so called &quot; securing stores , &quot; which will come into force from November 2016 .
contracts have a 12 months termin@@ ation period , so they will be able to start 2017 .
&quot; from therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute 17 to income , &quot; said the electricity supply . &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L will be limited to AG@@ L from G@@ J 18 , due to the forecasts of strong terminal markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that it has already written the value of contracts in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a termin@@ ation . &quot;
Al@@ co@@ a said that the decision to book the treaties , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... the melting of the power , or to ensure the power to ensure the power . &quot;
the US company said that it had concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should come into force from November this year , even if it is a statement , why it is resigned from the contract .
analyst due to the poor economic conditions in the industry before the possible closure of the Portland , Portland , Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the testimony of the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland , approximately 600 meg@@ a@@ watts , and Tom@@ ago will be able to electricity around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts .
if both plants should disappear from the market , which mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; straw market &#93; .

more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of September 6th edition of Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of Man@@ ag@@ trainer and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris ist on the cover of the coveted Sept@@ ember@@ issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; in a room full of people who I love , brought me the sight of this Co@@ vers for wines , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers is a bizarre ( or just Ke@@ eping Up to the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ) as well as the presence of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) as well as the cover of her sister , and that with a classic bet : you have planned all of a surprise party .
this represents the cl@@ esi@@ ze act of almost every birthday party ( Se@@ ac@@ ter@@ ry brought the set , &quot; You know that we would like to forget to take place on a play@@ site by 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) but they had to participate her other girl somehow to participate in this Pub@@ licity .
with regard to the September issue of Vo@@ gue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans started with safety .
K@@ end@@ alls &apos;s great sister Kim may find them to see what the Vo@@ gue cover is defeated ( she and her husband Kan@@ ye West were to see in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for himself .
the Sept@@ ember@@ edition is the most common edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a extent that resembles the picture of a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertising on ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ oni@@ sta ) , of the 8@@ 32 pages of the company ( 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revel@@ ation of its cover stars will be eag@@ erly anticip@@ ate that over the last two years of the magazine still dis@@ continued before the official publication .
women who were already on the cover , include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and Kate Moss .
over the last years , there were clearly more &quot; star@@ dom , the model@@ n &quot; as &quot; Model@@ s , &quot; the star@@ dom have been &quot; seen on the cover .
Oscar winner @-@ lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 at the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had honor the honor .
but even at the low chance that Ms. Jen@@ ner , is described by the magazine as the &quot; thorou@@ gh@@ ing model &quot; of their generation - below the previous category , it is in good society .
this celeb@@ r@@ ity are not related to the famous person or reality stars or young people , who know how to know a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything on Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade of one of the most successful years of her career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers do not like to finish any .
with her Reality @-@ TV &apos;s history , J@@ enn@@ ers was always sp@@ ell@@ ished in the fashion world .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called her &quot; Mi@@ st@@ ings of the eyeb@@ rows . &quot;
these feelings of cooked again , when the news with the appearance J@@ enn@@ ers came out on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but on the mis@@ er@@ ce couple seems to go straight at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is at the cover of September 6th edition of the Vo@@ gue cover .
it is in the true sense of the word a super model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your Grun@@ ee of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
and all of their sisters also sell your images from their respective Pay@@ wall Apps .
you are sold by her done pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LO@@ VE .
and in their leisure time she is seen in the reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
church centers contain 16@@ 0.000 people each year .
more than 16@@ 0.000 of the aid of the country are rejected by the country &apos;s relief centres per year , while the industry &apos;s impact on further medium @-@ short@@ ened transactions will be captured in excess of 16@@ 0.000 .
in Queensland , three of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , helpful workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for an odd del@@ o@@ gi@@ ants and similar materials - were rejected on free law advice and legal affairs .
legal services of the church , which are already over@@ thrown over , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , this legal centres will lose further 30 percent of its federal funds .
the Director of the National Association of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Culture Centers , revealed that thousands of people are rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation without a re@@ vocation of the German government would only be worse .
&quot; Queensland &apos;s council centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
people who are forci@@ bly forced to leave people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and pres@@ sive debt , families , which have an odd number of problems - all these people have problems and this survey revealed that they cannot receive the help you need .
as of June 2017 , the federal government will be increased by 30 percent , which amounts to thousands of people to be forced from Queensland , with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we call for the General lawyer and Federal Ministry of Justice , as well as Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to lift this middle short@@ ened , so that the people need them need for legal problems with legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled her promise to lift funds for rect@@ angle on the national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of the church centers and its client , to view the government &apos;s Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government in this important work .

while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to continue in the north , this is not possible according to the question@@ able values in Berlin .

Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and Internet in newspaper lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market .
today , the successor is dominated today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kilogra@@ m and was more than four times as hard as a iPhone 5 .
it was di@@ cker and bigger , it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ cked .
at the beginning , the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning of eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would be for about two rarity with a high resolution .
a iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; occurred exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the business and it was the first Smartphone .
for a few euros , lovers can buy the devices on the Internet , but they come from the stone @-@ age of the online age .
however , 20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
a few months ago , the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced a few months before@@ hand at the computer fair C@@ ebit in Hannover as &quot; office in the West@@ land format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails , and received by fax it was the Communic@@ ator .
even the access to websites was possible by HTML browser , even though qu@@ ery is slow .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and a electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be similar as a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
quite proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average sales price of smartphones in Germany amounted at 3@@ 92 Euro .
no one could happen in August 1996 , that the Communic@@ ator would be the start of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the wise teleph@@ ones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the cell division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented label , was finally sold to Microsoft .
the market today are providers that all of them arrived as Nokia .
ever since , it is online today , it is now for many people daily life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
there were sold approximately 1.4 billion devices , in Samsung and Apple , of which alone account for 5@@ 55 million .
worldwide sales of the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
to this , the well @-@ ongoing stores of the countless app provider and the telecommunications contracts .
around the smartphone has grown into an entire industry .
the decisive break towards the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple Head Steve Jobs at the Mac @-@ World &apos;s launch of the i@@ Phones .
he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communication , everything to operate as a touch screen .
the winners of Apple started , even today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the draw@@ back to the market .
they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the S@@ agen have now Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention .
in the cut , each German is now on his mobile phone 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to learn all of the smartphone &apos;s smartphone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in Siemens &apos;s Management Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility . meanwhile , as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must expand the Olympics in the Olympics and He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will not only bring to our local communities , and throughout London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
for me , the largest attraction He@@ ath@@ row , just as it was in London in 2012 , when we managed to make a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benef@@ itted from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and we will come back , by providing new possibilities for local and firms in the vicinity of He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities we will create 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs , and the youth unemployment in the airport environment will prepare an end .
as they were in London 2012 , it will be such that the challenge of expansion He@@ ath@@ row is big .
I said that England has never be ready for games to be ready for games and that we will be able to hold on the world stage bla@@ ze .
the two @-@ fl@@ er had been wrong in 2012 and it will be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to the disappearance , but He@@ ath@@ row answered the question .
as the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
the expansion is a possibility to create up to 18@@ 0.000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to wit@@ ching growth and to leave their jobs at the airport as well as in all GB .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has a £ 11 billion most expensive infrastructure programme in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal has been built up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequencies .
now they are ready to supply a third running , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investments .
in 2012 , the 2012 games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we extend this year &apos;s spirit len@@ ken and He@@ ath@@ row , as well as our future trading and a deep@@ ness of skills and employment , to which England can be proud .

the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left the struggle for social media in the struggle , is a powerful indi@@ gn@@ ation , like a wor@@ sen@@ ing display of the sector .
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people , according to a study , nearly four times are so much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion a day , users can access to Facebook via their mobile terminal devices , the hand@@ y@@ wer@@ der was 84 percent of the value .
the company has an ad block on desktop PCs , because mobile ad block i@@ erer no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , distributed a speaker with .

on Tuesday , Facebook with that there will be his &quot; ad potential tool , &quot; to have the people more control over it to they have rejected advertising .
on Thursday , Facebook said that Ad@@ ded the new filter is wor@@ rying , because they would also block content on the page , that no advertising are no advertising .
&quot; for users who does not have a positive experience , we plan to address the problem , &quot; distributed a spokesman of Facebook in an e @-@ mail notification .

NASA Klim@@ amo@@ del : Venus was once inhabited
Venus was likely to be able to deal with the projections of a new NASA climate model , probably once inhabited .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of the NASA developed a model to explore the past of the Venus using tools and algorith@@ ms that are similar to those of climate agreements .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus is used with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously announced that the slow transformation of Venus could be explained due to their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus had had a thin , petroleum @-@ similar atmosphere , and nonetheless slowly continue to continue .
the model illuminated also the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet believed was probably more dry regions than the earth , but had once enough water and geographic stability to life in order to accommodate life to life and cont@@ acting quickly and cont@@ acting .
the early Venus were also benef@@ ited from a sun which was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS models exp@@ on@@ ward the slow change@@ over of Venus did their daily side of the sun nearly two months , &quot; says G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io , a press release .
this is heated the surface and produces rain , which ensures a thick layer of clouds , which as an umbrella , to protect the surface of a majority of sunlight .
the result is average temperatures , a few degrees cooler than the earth today are .
the model brought a history of Venus &quot; that resembles the evolution of evolution , which was believed to be produced by Plan@@ ets .
although they were once inhabited , the Venus -- was exposed to a much more heat and ultra @-@ violet light in several years .
its oceans ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated and maintain its water vap@@ or from the ultra @-@ violet light .
as her hydro ge@@ wich remained only a thick atmosphere at the carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which as we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate models in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .

the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicates that the more recent stars slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes .
&quot; at the Ballet &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ads we see that slow red rot@@ ors will be able to be massive , while un@@ qui@@ cker for faster rot@@ ors , will be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the star of the P@@ lei@@ ades are so close , it is used as an ideal lab laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ads offers a anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it is still a lot of us what we would like to learn more about how the how , W@@ ann and War@@ um stars out their rot@@ ational rates and so to speak her &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues did detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of Ple@@ j@@ ads , that will appear soon on the astron@@ omy Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball Star occurs .
we &apos;ve worked with Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US @-@ Bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base .
after its emotional return , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro dates back to the T@@ amp@@ a Bay R@@ ays a last time the tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Google db@@ ye &apos; , the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game of the major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times was Rodri@@ guez for the most valuable player of the league , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
its signature under one tenth annual contract , has acquired 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the double contra@@ ction on 31 December 2017 , he acts as an advisor and youth coach - in full content .
as a player hon@@ ed it Rodri@@ guez for a long time with power .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas ranking ( 2001 to 2004 ) and the Yan@@ ke@@ es made a couple of mile@@ stones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays have only two further bases players in the main statistics similar values .
however , in the glory of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is likely not included .
for so successful Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field was , cont@@ ested its appearance outside the square .
as early as 2009 , the Super@@ star was launched at &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , he was locked to 211 games in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal up by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ guez is considered the main @-@ hand @-@ to @-@ use for years via an anti @-@ A@@ ging clinic in South Florida .
after a legal dispute the sper@@ re was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; the League could even be done for the year 2014 for the year 2014 , because I have played 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez at that time .
his f@@ arewell day do not run silent .
while many Bas@@ eball legends will receive the big stage once again , Rodri@@ guez was often sitting in the Bank .
&quot; my job is no f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; my job includes trying to win any game , &quot; &quot; &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was married to Rodri@@ guez who was married with the actress of his Pop@@ star and the actress of Pop@@ star Madonna and the actress of Kate Hudson , sympath@@ ies and fans of the fans of Yan@@ kee Rab@@ ri@@ vals Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; We want A @-@ Rod &quot; that the followers on the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez team .
Olympia 2016 : Chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing .
er@@ wis@@ s : because of a positive dop@@ ing sample may not start ti@@ li@@ the@@ tical Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be exceeded by the first official dop@@ ing in 2016 .
a wh@@ os@@ ed athlete would have won almost a medal .
the first official report on the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro in front of the seventh competition day are known .
the Chinese swimming pool Chen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish Ge@@ ograph@@ er Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positively in Brazil - immediately before the beginning of the already critical Ath@@ le@@ tics competitions , these messages will come to Un@@ time .
at Chen I had been demonstrated the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ d last Sunday , which is used as a m@@ asked agent for dop@@ ing .
the International Sport@@ judicial shof CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon in local time to take part in the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old won the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , only 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Chen had to take part in the operations of more than 50 m Fre@@ isti@@ l .
at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) , the opening of the B sample and a hearing was requested .
the national association , &quot; very seriously and requires Chen full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; zi@@ ed X@@ in@@ hua : &quot; we will work together with the International Sport@@ judicial shof CA@@ S together , and will accept the verdict . &quot;
for the first time in history is no longer the IOC , but the CA@@ S for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa through which 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not guilty , &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; explained the female athlete .
according to the report it is said to negotiate with the remaining substance in the EP@@ O .
thanks to B@@ NT , the B sample was said to have been positive , according to B@@ NT , the B sample was already positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Boj@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow , announced immediately with criticism of the athlete &apos;s athlete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes are not the right battles , &quot; he said , &quot; We are Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
thus , around all the li@@ fter gloves are not allowed in Rio with the chronic fatigue .
on Friday , the &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z in the class up to 85 kg , as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z has been tested positive on the an@@ ab@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both handles the intake , they are not allowed to start up to 94 kg in class up to 94 kg .
prior to the launch of the athletes , Th@@ ek@@ ova is especially serious , even for the reputation of the entire sports art .
the World Association IA@@ AF had the entire Russian team until except for systematic dop@@ ings in the start , also the L@@ äu@@ fern@@ ation Kenya will also be produced in Rio numerous bad news .
in the swimming pool , the previous trial in China had also provided with the previous disp@@ utes between the athlete .
thus , the Fren@@ chman Camille Lac@@ our@@ t joined the Chinese Olympi@@ amm@@ ers Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; Sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ isti@@ l , I want to refer to me , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in French Radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sun also stood at the heart of a debate with Australian M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; I don &apos;t have time and no respect for dop@@ ing @-@ Bet@@ rü@@ ger , &quot; said this .
Sun was in 2014 with the Chinese nationals positive for the stimulation of Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit just a three @-@ month sper@@ re .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ press h@@ acker their sol@@ dering money
programm@@ ers of Er@@ press@@ ors malware is currently targeted companies - and are successful in the same time .
according to a current survey of the malware Final Report , including 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surve@@ yed companies took over at least once , partly multi @-@ attack attacks with Er@@ press@@ er software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of the companies already had the goal of a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware outcome .
40 percent of the victims of the victims are prepared by the candidates required to use the challenged systems and data to be able to use data .
the perpet@@ rators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ rators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ bels , according to the observations of painting in corporate network works .
if they are successful there , the potential @-@ end sol@@ der can be considerably higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we observe fast evolution of poll@@ uting damages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ fare @-@ Chief Mar@@ cin Kle@@ cz@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then , the perpet@@ rators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ rators &quot; software for themselves .
however , private users were able to finish the change , but the change went down to company attacks in the past months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a O@@ pf@@ ers , she is looking for un@@ long changing files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encrypted the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and sol@@ dered the origin@@ als .
subsequently , the software demands the demands of the Er@@ press@@ er .
to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims must be money - usually in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ ie Bit@@ coin .
however , where a private users will see the personal photo database on the game , it &apos;s going to be able to stand sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage increases , if a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware increases .
22 percent of the affected German companies generated sales @-@ loss by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 percent , had to break up the business activities , in a case of life in life .
in Germany , several times were victims of attacks in attacks , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of nurse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Kle@@ cz@@ yn@@ ski , &quot; says Kle@@ cz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of the companies , who pay to pay their data .
for Manager , it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators .
the h@@ acker turn again and try to build a good reputation in order to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the F @-@ Secure safety researchers have examined the useful areas and contact with the outcome : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to build more money .
you declare their victims per chat , as they can pay per Bit@@ coin , free Support sites , or de@@ cryp@@ t for free example @-@ files .
and private professionals are rede@@ emed to payments of a few hundred euros , companies must pay some hard and five digit sw@@ men to get their data un@@ cryp@@ t .
given the potential high and relatively high risk growth , the h@@ acker are always professional and share the work , explains security experts from the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware about within one week . &quot;
however , it is unlikely that there are three or four persons .
the programmer sell their rescue software then in the form of a software construction to the actual pressing ton@@ er .
the current malware Kit was created by installing the malware himself and additional tools for one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; the scope of delivery is a adjustment tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski .
the Er@@ press@@ er are looking for further h@@ acker to spread the newly bought software under the victims of the victims .
we live in a service industry .
therefore , one of the forums in the sub@@ set , buys the set of a crime and commissioned a further to install the software on many PCs .
the payment takes place per in@@ quiries calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als carry the crime with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ewski .
the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known with many companies known to secure their data .
more than 50 per cent of the companies companies in the malign@@ ant @-@ debate in the Mal@@ war@@ fare @-@ survey rely on how R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware using file @-@ Back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software can be applied .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators have already cleared new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is no longer sufficient threat to successful outcome more , the perpet@@ rators are instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or price information , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ n @-@ Chief Mar@@ cin Kle@@ cz@@ yn@@ ski .
thus , the damage potential , depending on the type of data is still a multiple of more than previously .
also , the perpet@@ rators will continue to have completely new goals on the Internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrate security researchers , how they could have received the thermostat to their control with the Internet .
in the middle of the winter , the activation could be such a sol@@ dering heating so many such a sol@@ dering money .
if the perpet@@ rators will then be able to block the heating into a factory block in a factory , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware could also be subject to the Industry 4.0 .
one of all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday use .
a little SUV in the little HR @-@ V wants to un@@ pack it : a little SUV , a little coupé and even the versatility of a mini@@ vans .
sounds pretty clear , however , the HR @-@ V , which was made on the same new platform as the new jazz , is indeed very flexible in everyday life as a result .
although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V rather small , the passengers have a lot of passengers in the first row as well as in the first row , it works closely at any moment .
the materials of the inside space are well @-@ processed and works pleasant , only the cockpit top falls because something .
versatile vehicles is the HR @-@ V for storage space .
there is not just a suitcase set of 453 l in high @-@ valve and 10@@ 26 l covered back @-@ down back@@ rest , but there is the &quot; magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less mag@@ ically , than it sounds : the seats of the back @-@ bank can be high @-@ doors and thus offer the storage space , from the ground up to the ceilings of 1.@@ 24 m high .
the car boot is well @-@ loaded , but is the charging height with 650 mm slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to a torque of up to 300 Nm in wide frequency range , very powerful .
this is his work , however .
the all @-@ day consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is still another engine isation : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering system should be something direct .
equipment in the tested top version &quot; Executive &quot; has no wishes to be desired .
the new safety systems belongs to the City of Not@@ bre@@ ms@@ bu@@ ent ( works up to tempo 32 ) , the coll@@ isions system and track commands .

but the full connectivity are only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch tou@@ ch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App integration and more .
two USB@@ - and a HDMI @-@ jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat in@@ comprehen@@ sible .
the approx . 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are in order .
if you don &apos;t want to invest a lot , the petrol will receive 20000 euros , diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the motors carry the Euro 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday use .
Air@@ line shall not be : overthrow on the passenger bridge
a Air@@ line shall not be liable for the fall of a passenger bridge on the passenger bridge .
for a liability may be possible only by risks , the typical local court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the k@@ lä@@ ger had broken down for the fall .
however , the accident could happen anywhere - it can be a general risk of life , as the court .
the airline had no damage to damage .
disease fall : when paid the promot@@ er
breast holidays only get money back after their journey , when the cause of the disease is freely in the hotel .
however , this is only the case when more than 10 percent of the guests could show the same symptoms .
in the case the case was a family on the second day of their Turkish ur@@ bs hard to diarr@@ ho@@ ea and vomiting .
she spent nearly all holiday in the room .
their disease led the holiday@@ makers back on a def@@ ective k@@ itt@@ ens , which had to protect the sea water .
the family was the view , the journey was a lack of - and accused against the promot@@ er .
before court had no success no success .
indeed , the coupling situation was def@@ ective in effect .
but the organizers learned only shortly before departure of K@@ lä@@ ger .
he had to go up until then that sea water was in order .
he is not injured by his information - so that the judgment .
especially in the samples of water no imp@@ urities were found .
the condition of several hotel guests - if possible through plug @-@ in one , is available for general life @-@ risk .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 erk@@ es were only 38 .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the refugees of refugees in Würzburg , and Ans@@ bach , in July , many people were concern about other attacks in July .
the state must be pru@@ dent and react to terror at the same time .
surely is certain : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators not with hatred and split .
this triumph we can &apos;t find the terrorists .
if stra@@ ddle would have to leave the country , the height is the security and strength , even the consent of the population for refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to achieve the implementation of proposals to the federal election in 2017 .
he also announced another personalised rein@@ forcement of security forces , while &quot; in medium vi@@ ticul@@ tural size for more than several years . &quot;
sympath@@ i@@ als for terrorism is to be back under penalty .
video surveillance is said to have improved the weapons of arms , that is , above all the purchase of weapons on the Internet .
the last much discussed silence of the doctors said to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères , in the way .
however , he wants to search in dialogue with the doctors of physicians to seek solutions , how the endanger@@ ment of citizens would be reduced , he said with a view to psychological problems .
in order to implement a radi@@ k@@ alisation of refugees , the ministers holds a better social care .
teaching staff would have to be prepared better for dealing with traum@@ atis@@ ed people .
for the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of investigations .
SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , to raise safety further . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior announced in action against Action .
&quot; this was a stand for the hin@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; said Gabriel was the papers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had proclaimed Ru@@ fe from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double nationality .

better traffic flow on the auto@@ bahn
it marks regularly on the shift road - here &apos;s a picture of November .
but that is to change : the legal gu@@ ardian must be extended .
this is a good news for all the car driver , which stand in the field at St@@ au , when they drive on the motorway ( Zub@@ r@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the construction of road construction will be extended by the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) between the hammer and the exit of Wes@@ eler Straße .
drivers can then go right from the hammer road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic will be at the earliest in order to improve the total pressure on the versatile section of the Federal straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road@@ run on Zub@@ r@@ inger nerv@@ t is especially starting between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days from the back @-@ way back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ gans and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the needle hr drive on the B 51 , shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic only is s@@ unk via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built before a three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge has no longer necessary to load the required load capacity to record the heavy load of two tracks .
how long these bott@@ len@@ eck is un@@ related to this bott@@ len@@ eck , the state @-@ owned company is not say .
however with years ago : because the bridge has an official residual heat up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal position of law , the state @-@ run country has sought to travel into the school holidays because with disabilities .
the traffic will be run on Tuesday and Wednesday , at the end of the track .
inter@@ cultural journey : cultural activities for schools
the international class of Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; Das invisible House . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the young theatre plan now plan a musical project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s makes young people with a migration and refugee interests , cultural institutions at Münster .
the &quot; Class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s haus is a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the boys Theater in Münster .

most of the young people of the class are between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and got little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the s@@ zen@@ ischen images and video animations , it was possible to follow the action step , so the press release of the boys Theater Münster .

rain instead of constellation : hope on weather conditions
the weather has made the star of the Gu@@ ck@@ ern @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in southwest Germany in the night to a ste@@ rich through the bill - but there is still hope to hope .
the night was not suitable for clouds and rain po@@ or@@ ly suitable for the kingdom of heaven , said the chairman of the ob@@ servatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is to be good , then we see many star @-@ dancing in the sky .
the star@@ bs are Per@@ sei@@ den , who belong with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their names because she comes from the constellation of Per@@ se@@ us , coming up in the northeast .
relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
in the evening , we travelled around at night , at night , the morning , in the morning , the wake @-@ up should not remember sleep ahead of the wake @-@ up of the wake @-@ up .
that &apos;s all other as a relaxing .
anyway , it is possible with such problems in good company : according to Robert Koch @-@ Institut , it has about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than 10 per cent , are often common or permanently .
how to have sleeping problems or sleeping disorders ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there are many forms of sleep , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ek , member of the German Society for Schla@@ derer and sleep Medicine .
what one understands of them , but the in@@ som@@ nie , thus allows an entry and sleep distur@@ bing .
just entering the journey there are many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , is a member of the German Hou@@ sehold association with practice in Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it , organic , psychological or contra@@ ctual factors , but also for medicines .
not rare , the sleep expression of a different condition .
&quot; very early hair is often common in the depression , &quot; says We@@ ak .
and it may be that different factors are thank@@ ed .
for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , it can be quite hard to reach all two to three hours and begins to keep silent on everyday life and guarantee , sp@@ rou@@ t is an example .
this leads to An@@ voltage , and sleep is no longer possible .
when it should be with sleeping disorders to the doctor ?
who spend over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and have been inf@@ ring@@ ed on the day , the doctor should go to the doctor .
the impair@@ ment can be different different : it is beaten , tired , un@@ eas@@ iness , has trouble with attention and concentration , is easy to be easily able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ aches .
to lin@@ ens the sleep disorder , it is important to figure out its causes .
as a treatment options , including behavi@@ our@@ al changes , a cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medications - classic dormit@@ ories only in exceptional cases and most for two weeks - qu@@ ery .
in Germany there is hardly ever there in Germany , in Germany , Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze ; head of the interdisciplinary medical centre of the Charité University Medical Center Berlin .
therefore it should be able to contact with sleeping on the house@@ work , Cor@@ t We@@ ak .
the test can clari@@ fy if problems have a physical cause .
who should happen to the sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for the investigation in the sleeping laboratory in medicine , for example , for sn@@ ap@@ ons with respiratory sick@@ ness , in disease wor@@ d@@ ness , or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleep disorder .
for the investigation , we must not have to prepare itself .
you should spend the day a normal day .
&quot; please do not make your lunch sleep , &quot; says Fi@@ etze .
after the short@@ ened time , one goes into bed .
in addition to the electro@@ des on the body you can create a nose glasses , a chest strap , and a anten@@ n@@ ae .
in addition , a camera is dedicated to the ceiling in the sleeping area .
how can be affected the problems in the handle ?
there are quite a lot , to which one can set for a better sleep .
We@@ ak counts on : regular sleeping and season times , not too sleep in bed , not to sleep on the day , not to sleep on the day , the alcohol is not allowed to sleep at the clock - then you &apos;ll find out immediately , and that &apos;s all not promoting .
what the Jama@@ ung@@ ess camp with lack of medals in the swimming pool
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has chosen by Facebook to dis@@ appoint@@ ing the DS@@ V teams at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he picked up the first world championships for the first time in Doha and presented his first world record at the same time .
the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler is cont@@ ests his sc@@ orer with the former ex @-@ mate former @-@ team @-@ mate .
&quot; in a country in which a Olympic Games have 20,000 € re@@ mie and a clo@@ ak of 150,000 € should not be surprised about the medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night on his Facebook page .
the promotion system in the swimming pool is bad , while dop@@ ing controls very good .
with this , we can not compete with countries who want to promote very much , and do not operate on the topic for dop@@ ing .

it is exactly what to keep it with countries .

airport : Ban@@ de of Luggage Storage
professional di@@ ebe at the airport Düsseldorf
civil society of Düssel@@ dorfer police arrested on Thursday the arrest of two women and two male at the age of 50 to 61 .
the Tat@@ ars were committed to a band of several ponds and bag @-@ ste@@ els .
at 21.@@ 30 pm , civil servants from the airport of Dus@@ seldorf , a Ban@@ de , who was known for the polic@@ emen from last theft .
two women and two men had been committed to several staff members since the middle of July this year and were engaged in general , skilled workers and especially professional .
the specialist of the Krimin@@ al@@ Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can only travelled to Germany in order to withdraw from stra@@ ft@@ ades to Germany .
they had a total of over 15,000 euros .
Alt@@ ay , a few aven@@ ue of Linden@@ um@@ ption , in between the R@@ ī@@ ga road in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain acts on the first glance , but the police counts as far as the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
from the east to the west , one goes along the east to the West , you can pass a baby girl , a visitor &apos;s kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the façade of a grey house has someone &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite a Li@@ dl , which will also be dem@@ ol@@ ished soon , will be built here : by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new apartments are produced here .
articles about this &quot; trendy Born district , &quot; as the real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain are , however , preferred by the burning cars , however .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents are out@@ bound , however , on the ground floor , however , are still occupied rooms and are used for events .
particularly of the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator H@@ enkel , he had a hard action against the police against the project , as well as the &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
after June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede had been cleared up for three weeks , according to the police , with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site , locked parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile the renovated construction workers in the order of the unknown house owners use the premises .
on 13 July , a Berlin Admini@@ strative Court decided that the clearing was illeg@@ ally illegal , and one day later he went to police and workers at the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ isers and lawyers .
at this summer , the road looks peaceful : parents go with children , people sit on the Bürger@@ sti@@ g in front of the houses in the sun , others will join the front of it .
in the immediate vicinity of the front , there are basic school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main point of many suggestions : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who resi@@ des in Kiev since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who is here three children , are mostly from the police .
with the inhabitants of the Hau@@ projects , it divide the concern about their concern , and bo@@ un@@ ing its concern .
it doesn &apos;t sound after a pine forest , like the majority of police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ asing Left .
the gra@@ bs , which the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator and the police have settled between home@@ ers and their neighbours , apparently not apparently there .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers district , which is also a lower average in comparison to the rest of the city .
numerous houses and the resulting studio projects belong to the Kiev protests : in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer road , near the R@@ ī@@ ga road .
while the main@@ board had been cleared under a large police station , many of the projects had been leg@@ alised in the Rig@@ ī@@ ga projects and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them for 26 years ago .
at the same time , the quarter of the past years has become a magn@@ ets for tourists and elect@@ ber@@ liner from all over the world : with them , people who share from GDR @-@ times and former household .
this also makes the noticeable noticeable , which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga community are attacked as symbols for these development : one sees them , or fresh cul@@ ades that were subjected to colours .
no other street was mentioned this year so often with the words &quot; left autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason for this , not all the neighbours could not be seen as problem , could not be affected by the crime of Crime : crimes , such as body viol@@ ating statistics , statistics estimate almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of Stra@@ ins do not make non@@ damage , the ten@@ den@@ ci@@ ally rather the new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the disputed level of 94 , cannot be given by un@@ certainty .
in terms of violence , it is described : people in the 94 are their neighbours , which were not determined .
also the famous burning cars give it directly in the R@@ ī@@ ga longer .
for the architect , architect has been a criminal focal point , on the contrary , &quot; here we helps each other , along with the street and gets more of each other than wo@@ unds . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is aware in the R@@ ī@@ ga road and remained in the R@@ ī@@ ga road .
therefore , it was so important that the natives are returned to their road : from the police , the politics and the media , which in July all suddenly won the Deut@@ ch nation in July .
but in the eyes of berries like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away . by the most dar@@ less new buildings in former construction , the old residents of the old inhabitants .
&quot; these are two con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many here - here is more people who are not so good , &quot; says them .
&quot; violence and destruction is absolutely non gu@@ ardian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should make sure if a never someone else ?
there is an attempt on all sides of fru@@ stration , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for drawn , who caused about color bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin project and the left scene belonged to the jaw .
who is her@@ ent , should be aware of this - just as someone who moves in a pub in a pub in which it can compl@@ ain about noise for the noise of the noise .
all only with the names of those persons have been asked to be named , not with their right name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner for the integration and organi@@ zer .
she is also a social worker site .
since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le also instru@@ cted the refugee camp for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agogue supports the team of administration around Achim Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it looks as a contact person for all actors , refugees , working groups , administration , authorities and who are otherwise mis@@ er@@ able .
Reg@@ ine customer wanted to show that the volunteers is more than grat@@ eful that Deu@@ sch@@ le now is , the ei@@ ves of Woll@@ is@@ au that has above all a problem .
in such a few - less sp@@ ott@@ est than rather , on the multitude of wish to wish to be targeted , confir@@ ming , when the administration wanted to write the place .
we are looking for an administrative ten@@ sion@@ ing force with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , a ei@@ ro@@ uted Woll@@ is@@ au .
but administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le , writes of Deu@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
especially to the organization , work with people on site and also behind the scenes and networking activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been around for six weeks .
it has a 50 percent place on three years .
&quot; it was the highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le , and principal actors are supported .
there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and communication problems .
soon be new container in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem is , it has been approved for some time , the apartments have been recognized for inter@@ fer@@ ries .
for the connection , local communities are responsible .
you need to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented rooms .
the cost of construction , rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be equipped .
the responsibility was to replace by the federal office of the Commune , and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every land@@ lord wants to offer his home .
the search goes for some time as a very difficult .
de facto takes the administration no private apartments .
it has not so far not so far , we are involved in private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , basic apartments must be worn as it is so nice .
so soon the container will be installed in W@@ as@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine Customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le were unanim@@ ous .
in addition to a fixed lead , there are training places , training places , school places , a @-@ euro jobs and support for refugees and migrants .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Customer Service . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help Haus@@ master , do not do not do not do not do , and the motivated and very ti@@ dy , such as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
they hopes that the work has been working for a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only work .
the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a random sensation .
so there are part offers as sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
thus , we ski@@ pped the administration and hon@@ ors of the volunteer .
it is centrally that the refugees get the feeling , they are in Germany and welcome .
long duration of the procedure should be a problem .
you have to explain the refugees that it lasts and the time makes sense , for example , with language courses .
whoever has the feeling of development , he could help him in Ur@@ bach would not work , will not work and be un@@ profitable , which will never be able to integrate it .
the significant majority are motivated .
but also , there is also a client , &quot; people say , &quot; even if nothing is going to do . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer would therefore be more , other to motiv@@ ate .
everything is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : have the two according to recent preparation of fear of radi@@ c@@ alization , also in a small village like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer &quot; very clearly , &quot; what is &quot; man@@ cher n@@ ai@@ v &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a residual risk could not be saved . &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ zes the hel@@ pers .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to the refugees .
the fear that the assassination attempt to bring them completely .
&quot; you want to show that they do nothing to do , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary volunteers have to hold on site and keep in the region after activities .
in the background , they always have in the background that soon a new Sto@@ cks could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
this question is clear to answer the policy .
actually it is too much to place them on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach , we are still not since arrived , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the location .
Reg@@ ine Customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher has already been able to integrate the previous people to be reasonable .
these are currently around 100 persons , mainly young men .
however , if people are in need of need to help them are both women agree .
the political situation is so complicated , since there is no simple answers .
