<seg id="1">Clinics and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: IT's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">In infrastructure and the trade agreements TTP - this would like to prevent Clinton as a trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US-Presidency, however, are under control and energy policy as well as in a basic case.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trung and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental difference, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">This, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warning that, as the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton explains the economy to death and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">In contrast, it would be quite different, claims are trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will return to regulatory approval, and he makes a wide-reaching control system with lower tax rates strong - for private professionals and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says, "Clinton says:" the state has to comply with certain tasks, he needs to open the disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes for inclusion, they would be increased.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both very close to the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the fact, trump and Clinton will be almost worshit.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic application in announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment program in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are denied by government-critical tey wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, there is still cross-party discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even more significant differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trashi wants to build coal-fired power plants and the coal production in the USA will be able to drive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil promotion is also to be protected in so far-protected areas, the Parisian climate agreement wants to raise.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton wants to expand the renewable energies by renewable energy products: "a country will create the superpower of clean energy and will create million jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want to be there. "</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazides trade agreements, don't want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the U.S. do not want to isolate the international trade - but just an American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">The should also be paid, too, calls for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is to be a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What do I want to do this question is not quite clear: once, he says: the minimum wage must be rst, then he says, he will not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the great discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policies of the two camp.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one side stands, trump, which aims to boost growth and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics keep his critics before, so the budget deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants to pay for at least of the road demand that they pay more taxes, and its critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence is part of women who flee alone, almost as daily life.</seg>
<seg id="3">If they are arriving in Germany, they are often sad.</seg>

<seg id="11">You smilking short and add the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene is normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">It speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She has been Managing Director of Condrobs, a carrier for social relief activities in Bavaria, and is dealing among other things with the theme of women on the flight.</seg>
<seg id="15">Four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the North in one of the few decentralized accommodations for women-related women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs won the establishment together with Pro Family and the Munich Women's aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently, she became officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Males there is no - not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a qumann in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say," every woman who has been here on her escape experiences with sexual violence, "says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="23">"men escape to wars because they are politically prosecuted because of their families, torture or death, or because their families they send as a hopes to Europe," she tells them.</seg>
<seg id="24">In women, there are other reasons for the escape: "many steal out of them, because they don't see any other way away."</seg>
<seg id="25">In her home, she made experience with sexual violence, forced, honourable, slave or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives them.</seg>

<seg id="29">And women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who think that the end, as soon as they arrived in Germany, irre, tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even here would be used women in refugee camps often used as minderless, and the worst case would be abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">That leads to that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich north, are traumatised.</seg>
<seg id="33">Some of the children are sure to surrendered. "</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so much that they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they can't be trusted to speak about the salvation because the sham is great."</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often have not help to help you need more accommodations only for them, calls for Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district registrations are responsible for the lodging of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question whether they are using a similar project as in Munich in its influx area, reply some with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, there are something in accommodations of the governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Schwaben, women were not separated by women, Karl-Heinz Meyer, press Officer of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Oberbayern, Lower Saxony and Central Franconia, there are some common storeys or own homes, only for single women and their children.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outdoor side"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture which finished a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leader of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and an official end of the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart at the St. Petersburg Palace of St. Petersburg in reception, I can not leave me out of the press-pressure that Ankara is at most provocation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handheld, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putesmile took part in the smile, and he hardly any heat from, even for its back conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke according to his "love friend" Putin - according to a report of five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even further improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the next day, a newspaper showed that Erdogan would like to know that Erdogan would like to happen before, as if it had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">I seemed to indicate his enthusiasm rather than the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin-radiant, sustainable Küch found that the state of Staff had nothing forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his introductory words: the firing of a Russian fight against Turkey in the Syrian border.</seg>
<seg id="14">In Moscow to the time was wanting branched.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin explained and accused Ankara, Russia in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The go was even bigger, as it was perpetrated by a friend of my friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetema again rebuild it difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media led a sharp, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once, it seemed as if the Turks would bear the guilt for everything the guilt.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the serious case, the accusations from executive officials announced that Earth's own family had been benefited from illegal oil trading in the areas of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He contested it vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message, that it was time to look back to the front.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin was the President of Erdogan's President of Erdogan's resolution that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a truce is clear in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Earth's Erdogan requires all friends that he can get dead, after he became a coup d'etat in a coup d'etat in the last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken it.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there is also economic motifs.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions will be hard to hit Turkey - in particular the ban of charter flights, which is usually to bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is dropped by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel management and charter companies can be facilitated if the flights will be resumed again.</seg>
<seg id="33">You count on a late summer of the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the State TV provides fruit and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti stated it as follows: "tourists there, tomatoes are long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is in the west to waged, since it's reaction to the power in response to power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the persistent Groll of the EU accession negotiations for the negotiations for accession to the EU's accession negotiations and Putin is to go out from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the west.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian President leader took Ankara in Ankara with security a bonus that he demanded a coup d "état to support the elected coup d" état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is intended for Moscow to be a self-contractual that even had a profound fear of opponents.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit meeting place in this glorious palace, with Russia and Turkey, as it described an analyst, as it described an analyst, "Alliance of external side": two countries that deals with the West and have treated bad.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two still wide differences.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow were recently held the role as a peace agreements, but where Russia and Turkey were able to support Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be possible that after nearly three hours on the initial conversation, both President had said to press conference on the press conference that they did not harm the theme.</seg>
<seg id="45">In fact, President of Turkey prevented it possible to reply to a question about their differentiation, whereas Putin decided to emphasize them.</seg>
<seg id="46">It is not a clear consensus about where a common Nenner can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of hostility, and in view of the potential of the potential, the Nato-member Turkey set to the Russian martial jet - it's certainly better to talk about two heads of state at least.</seg>

<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport committee.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a statement of the Kremlin, it is that Putin without information for reasons "the dismissal Ivanovs was arranged by his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration."</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanovs's deputy since 2012, was named after his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the estonian capital of Tallinn, he made his graduating at the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremg. it is called (to Russian) that he was later to head-head and Chief Executive Officer of the Regiership.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said about his appointment he said to Putin: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the most important mission of the government to support his activity as a state of law and inspections to the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin was shared by the Russian TV station on Friday, that Ivanov has asked about to leave his post and vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has been mysterious from Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergej Ivanov was a long time one of the narrowest confidentists of Vladimir Putins and works as he works for the Soviet intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on TV, both men who returned to his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the notns for the cameras, here are just a few of it - above all, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is here the result of a type of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">No one doesn't have no one.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who had once had to act as a potential president, I stumbled upon the Russian environmental policy - reached big skepsis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, Ivanov said, "says Ivanov," it is true that I have asked me in a conversation to me this very complicated post - it could say almost as good for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turned out, I've been the Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration since four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian security Council and how Putin is former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the KGB, was appointed Ivanov in his deputy representative.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin took power to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people, which he trusted in most confidential.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become the second term president of Russia, as a third term coup against the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post has been taken by another, near-called ally coup coup, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president after three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is building accommodations apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and regards to my: investors are supposed to be mandatory much more in the duty.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig in the next few years almost 1300 cheap apartments will lose?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "" "" Action Concept "" "" for the next installment session. "" "</seg>
<seg id="5">Yet war is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">The first line is to be the question: who should actually build a favourable apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">One regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">SPD Executive Vice President Christoph Dalmann said: "we are trying to build ourselves with the Greens: who wants to build urban areas in future will need 20 percent of all apartments as a sociology."</seg>
<seg id="9">The affordable apartments, however, can also be produced.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the big armed forces in the city hall was, but Bratmann: "how do you want to build Asia with investors who want to build private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want to build investors on these areas of at least 10 percent, but as possible as 20 per cent of the apartments are served as a sociology."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban residential building programme which will cost millions of cost will cost and it will be financed to allow for attack.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, so Bratmann: "there is still no agreement between the fractions" at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make more detailed regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left is still hardness editions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Because of this, Bratmann, bahne is a disappearance of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Decision concept is implemented, will ensure additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yet the program does not fully follow: because the approximately 1260 new apartments should be built, they should be built.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do not make a loss of some 1,300 affordable apartments whose promotion is running in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">Until 2020, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, in order to prevent the planners, Nicole Palm ®, you should now be purchased the ongoing rate of the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, they would have to be thought again to get back to the price binding.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western city the end of Friendship.</seg>
<seg id="28">About 1800 apartments could you get back to the price for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this is the owner, the residential construction companies not.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of sociology in Western town will be drastically increased, removed from the aim of the so-called mixture.</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of socialist weak in just a few city share it should not be more.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Green anticipate that there will be more motion in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Group leader Holger Herlitschke said: "for a broad majority, the CDU must be with the boat."</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, which is worthwhile</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to look like the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenager and child can not go out to the outside, but rather prefer to spend their time to spend on screens, and in the last decade of many complains.</seg>
<seg id="4">For Pokemon Go, it's about to pick up people from the sofa and can be active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time at the screen was initially limited on TV, video on video game and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it's great to see that technology and activities do not close each other each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn that is based on the characters which initially were created for video game in the 1990s (later created a drawing series, playcards and other spin-off).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture sunk the interest before the release of the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">In other countries, the market launch in other countries moved to the massive demand that the server overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within less days, Pokémon Go more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it works?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the player go out to poker by car, and looking for Pokémons, which were followed by a GPS, once they were found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "caught."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game, when she was still younger, joined the Wahn and sprang up for the search for the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that puts the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardio m, an app for Apple Watch, distributed by 35,000 users, shared the Washington Post with launch that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of participants followed every day 30 minutes, by 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know, who plays in Pokémon Go - it looks only the rough data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns to health, people who want to bring up "about 30 minutes to come" and "every day to be active on your ears, because many public embassies around the health are boring, and of people come to look.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports can not be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly take Sport drives to reduce its chances to cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical exercise helps with weights control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages that lead to a long time to handle them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful at Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open air that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people include close to the hunt even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there is also mürk game perishops, which must always be complain about anything.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is said to 's?</seg>
<seg id="27">It is a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit already travelled to our activity, they gave us a reason to push the sport, as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its friction, and the use will be replenished with the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemons, there will be more games, the apps and virtual reality with the activates will be combined in the real world and to be able to help many people on the hunt, active, fitter and gestions.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British travel with his immune system and Würgereflex moved to a serious review by giving some of the dirt and ekest places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk chaired on Piccadilly Circus, a dished head of a tractor toilet and a public telephone in Russia to establish the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before Ablecks any property, he used a Luminometer to show and let us know what he will be.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filtered under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results in daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, the dished head of a train toilet, who was used already by thousands of others, may be completely shock, but actually, in a kitchen spawle more poor bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright said with doctors and medical specialists across the promotion of Darmbaberien as well as his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, in the mouth he left nothing, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of its Darms by the world and ate wonderful things as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money to rail stations up to rinsing of toilets, the task presented his immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "already as a child, I was relatively unworried about what my health concerns and I have put all possible things in my mouth, Earth, sausages and sammate."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he became aware of his reputation in each case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The disposed what he able, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His prostitution showed a Luminometric count of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison to this, the Luminometeration amounts to less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to hold out after their Luminometeration about 4000 units, while fresh hands would have a lesser hands of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Valio produced the travel agency 'The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "who shows the bacterities in various locations as the bathroom shows</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film he says: "that comes the worst, what I have heard in a toilet, close to."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'll have nothing to get here, because there is drelter here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company uses Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D, to support the promotion of Darmbaberien and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuormaa says: "we wanted to do something new!</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that look ahead for watching and at the same time the benefits of Probiotics is explained.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted Brainstormings through the so that we told "Lass us Ian call."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health is to become a global phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talk about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, meaning the importance of intestinal health and how they are linked with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with the documentary we could provide the consumers for more information on a interesting way and manner.</seg>
<seg id="29">I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the Director of the film, added: "let's say it my respect for Ian, when he had suffered some of the things that I have made him to leaks them like the eclipse Russian toilet, that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things to bring easier to whom it was simple, Ian, and others, where these were quite hard.</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we have recorded some of these dirty treat in film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by the Valio survey conducted by the year 2015, 84 percent of those surveyed with the well-being of the stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally products that are supplied with lactobacillus folic acid.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not to choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="3">She understood it in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">2021 will not take place at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">As far as far as far, it's not: summer holidays, heat and landing tests - which is included.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are convinced by the elections, are supposed to be on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The very many tourists that are on the country, in Usedom, Rügen, or Hiddensee, are not the locals, though not the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition to this, practical problems: in the holidays are helper, the posters depend on air balloons, flyer and at the end of the vote, just ireving.</seg>
<seg id="9">By September 4, 2016, the electoral Day of the last holiday house, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must pass over the people over the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot stage when you can ever say that it has just started.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it also goes to something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition has to fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, which has been strongest party since 1998, is now clear behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">What is exciting, as strong Neuling AfD aborted and what remains at the end of Koalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008, Chief of Staff, makes an almost unobstructive campaign, you can see from his large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, with roses and chats a little with the people, as it is also his legendary artist Harald Ringstorff present.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, sailors will get cold feet and gives the guilt at the salvation of the Afel.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their refugee policy, her "We create," have accelerating the rise of rectangle lists, which will probably cost the nice office cost.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has experienced, as it is, if you are at the right place in the right place.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited twice German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Grand Chancellor Angela Merkel in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group not voted, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as the Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"since it was probably the majority of other federal states," accused Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it seems too bad to hear from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise the northeastern CDU is largely restricted to the usual election campaign on market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and air balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This, so Kokert, plays only one "role."</seg>
<seg id="25">Also the Union has also noticed that its base has been crumed on the land that it must be very strict to find out again a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: in the country hardly exist.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU electret to his fellow-stroke, however, "you have to go to them, where people are weaken, where people are: Dorffeste, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much on the game is, Sellering has called his SPD to be called for a particularly dedicated election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys the Social Democrats began with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just under the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the 2011 election the SPD gained clear with 35,6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, have been able to create the leap in the land day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make of the holidays in need a modern tuce and put their electoral campaign to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Online-election campaign," calls it the Landesverende Claudia Mueller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, the green electoral wardrobes came on track to national mood among tourists.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the top candidate country, curvt just with a house-boat with the meckli lakes and it is also beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination boards: who purchases important sound boards?</seg>
<seg id="2">All men do not love with middle-age boards.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you go to the commentary box to overflow him under the pseudonym non-doped male age, this statement leads from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the advancement of sound boards do not want to focus on a boom in Millennials that would like to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but on Midlife Nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a plate, are all predictions according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group 18-24 is the most likely Käuferous group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also no hormones by planbysammers - it has an emotional meaning: older record players keep their feelings rather for (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But vote on the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog, a news report would follow me, while I would follow the camera, while I go out in a bustling road in the Soho, a modest grey suit, and my hands hold, my hands hold, and somewhat worrying, as: "so, let's be looking for a great view."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's throw us a look at.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Soos were slow down to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices, the building that once had an independent seller - there are also independent seller - there are a handful of fantastic turntables.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would be the camera to ask the camera to switch the camera to the next part, where I understand, in the immediate proximity to various men, such as shops, try to estimate their age and vegetables through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart, Glasgow, 55, from Sister Ray (data number: eight young women, three men-age) to Reckless Records (data number: eight young women, one woman, probably around the 20) follow, is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through business to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, question I?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 sheets.</seg>
<seg id="17">This sound plates, above (he sent me the snapse by e-mail, I am not yet home) where the walls can be used.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy-it, when he appeared, and once again purchased objects that he sold it, when he was young and pleaded.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things that I buy, are out of the late 60s, early '70s, which was released, when I was 11 or 12. things that I was probably young to buy me," says he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is true that those who buy the plates buy, rather an independent time and add it alone, and adds: "I don't do, and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers that he meets, on the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback, and to buy themselves again to buy their old sheets again.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the talks who I have led, people usually managed to emptied in 1998 or 1999 in their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records sold to buy CDs, sell now their CDs to buy themselves again, "says he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom on the battle of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what is the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that record stores offers a calming community of equality.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older customers expect to contact the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans have been overwhelmed by the digital world, and want to go to the stability of confidential Schallplattenls, of objects that call a happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think it can sometimes be the filling of a shere or possession of material owners as a kind of Trost," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as collectors and I think it is so many people such.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to employ mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" fles become a staff of one record table.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a plate bought a plate they haven't heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey found that 41% have a turntables that never use them, while 7% of those who buy a plate, no turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At that time of Intelligence, I would probably look very worried, while I would like to come to Bossa Nova compilations by a stack of Bossa Nova Scotia.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (data number: three men-age), has a "trophy-effect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came in just recently here and said," I have no turntables, but I would like to buy a Radiohead Schallplatte, so I'd expect it to Regal. "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a great percentage, but it happens definitely.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive high, less musiklastig.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say, "I don't have any turntables."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older which come only slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which dedicated to the sound boards almost a whole floor, has a blower audience, when I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists, photos make, teenagers and women in medium age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the pre-standing shops, Wild Beasts's latest synthesizer and sounds from the speakers - it's good to see such a diversity in customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them can be seen sonly, but the brand psychic traumata are hard to handle, if one stands for someone 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs in business since some minutes in business and viewed the variation on the sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It's rather a display bumps than a large one-buy.</seg>
<seg id="50">They don't deserves much, hence the collector of plates are no real option, it says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs too much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or on other way, but the beauty of plates is... "it drives with a lovely seufzer.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business whose name is said to have inspired you to have a new generation of record players: Urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the answer the jeans Hotpants to musters, a group of young teenagners that are grouped for a moment to buy Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a crosley turntables.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left, a stairway, a wall full of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classic, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - maybe because they are only pure decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to specify them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "Plattenkunst."</seg>
<seg id="59">But in view of that, any attraction for these objects are more money for the industry, and some customers could send in the depths of Sothos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, that is the one that's most for luxury objects such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research studies show that the results of YouGov they vote, at least in turntables in Soho, the great number of female collectors and turnaround, which exist in reality, record shops and online shops.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety not by turnout of the Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they are driving a uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter that looks on the shoulders of the shoulders of all the middle age.</seg>

<seg id="4">The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be destroyed, because they would have a parallel economy would be paid, from which no taxes would be paid for tax and food risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared out the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals that are offered by state-supported association and other groups, not enough food for growing numbers in stock.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition, they led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there is no legal basis for the expulsion of people, who run the 72 provisional stores, but dreamed that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais "absolutely retraversable."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes, and restaurants would play a much bigger role, as merely people live, who live in extreme preoperative conditions. "</seg>

<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operated and did it.</seg>

<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio, luck was that he could start the treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, so the interruption was held on a minimum, if that could be the right term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive giveaway.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was at the hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet, 30 foot, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>

<seg id="24">Without Robin would we have no one, so there's a massive thanks to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I have no better person to check or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not keep up with their opponent.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark took close, Stanning and Glover had much in Reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "back to the process, lasting in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to be ripping away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not able to make something special Tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted to do not a fireworks, we wanted to get a good result, go out and the race win what we did.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Singen, Ursel has accompanied their whole life: as a young girl was in the school choir, in the Lehramt-study, they took the subject of Music, and today he sings the 78-year-old in a Seniors Choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"sing me - emotional and physically seen," she describes me.</seg>

<seg id="5">She does not work something good in her health and their spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because Singen is equal to several perspectives for a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior liga.</seg>
<seg id="7">The seniors in the choir, and share with equestates the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">By regular connections, social contacts can build and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often, social and family structures are in the age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience also has made the Ursel kipp in her choir: "to discuss and organise the other one, another choir is a very special form of awareness."</seg>
<seg id="11">Sing in the positive sense, Hackler explains.</seg>
<seg id="12">Exercise a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly calls his lungs regularly, also in everyday life not as fast as the puste.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to the sound of the voice in the age, Singen is an optimistic hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">For older people, Singen often has a very special effect, say Ursula Lenz, by the federal community of the Seniors organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the common Singen had a much higher position, it belonged to the everyday life, both in the school and in the leisure time.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz seen often that the Singen or listening of songs in older people, many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">By song contexts and especially tunes even denounce people in long-flying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Singen, the head does not require a special performance, explained Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, at the same time, at the same time, the rhythm would focus on a given rhythm and to adapt the other singers, that is a major cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people, living alone, practice, practice, not only focus on himself.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that you can get through the Singen in the choir, Hackler, said Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is growing up with the Singen in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">Themselves: if I have long been for something übe, I'll have better and waking up over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with the Singen, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try out a new hobby, it should not hesitate to have little talent to have little talent.</seg>
<seg id="28">One sings are not alone - with 50 sints people who hears there, if there is a sound like this?</seg>
<seg id="29">On the search for the matching offer, various ways, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sings someone from the friend in a senior enchyor, one can easily be easily connected.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Who like to sing in a church choir, would like to sing directly to the church or the Church's Church.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior enchyors are also about the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you don't have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors have to ask the help of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">He who want to sing, should definitely make a choir to connect Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Sing, the soul is well and has a somewhat unlock - this is true for each age.</seg>

<seg id="4">So the immigrants of Islamic Faith or the Middle East are diffuse diffuse diffuse in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="5">Therefore we observe the movement now.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "Identitants" is a group of grouping with French roots which has been active in Germany since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="7">It turns against "Multikulti-Wahn," an uncontrolled mass migration "and" loss of the own identity. "</seg>
<seg id="8">Constitutional Compler in nine states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - watch the "identification" already.</seg>
<seg id="9">Maate said his authority was closely matched in the decision closely with the state's decision.</seg>
<seg id="10">"groups such as the 'Identitaries' try to pick up their target groups, where it stands," said the constitutional Complaints. "</seg>

<seg id="12">The daily Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.</seg>

<seg id="14">The propaganda should be emotional.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are here in particular ways.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">Recently, there was a report from several federal states concerning contacts of the "Identitary" to AfD-Political.</seg>
<seg id="18">Maate said he had no knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the constitutional protection, the potential contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point.</seg>
<seg id="20">It comes to whether the respective party - in this case, the AfD - by certain people that changes their destination, changes their destination.</seg>
<seg id="21">So the decisive factor is, whether such individuals have an influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="23">Looking to the significant increase in rights motivated by law and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodations, Maate, he would not speak in this context not by a new right terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="24">But we found it into the past years that it can be risteroid structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the Group 'Old School Society' or the Friday group.</seg>
<seg id="26">It may be quite certain that further right-wing groupings or small groups that form attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee sheime or attacks out of other right-wing Motives.</seg>
<seg id="27">A clear or pan-European control of rectangle is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups are made on regional level or in social network.</seg>
<seg id="29">Worried about Maate that many overlaps to the account of humans, which had not been in the right wing in the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the alumption.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many of the Tatras at attacks on asylum was not known as a criminal, politically active, or trailer on the right scene.</seg>
<seg id="32">So many people have committed crimes committed before that in the right-wing extremists, they were politically undifferent, or for example, CDU, the SPD or left, who then do not have their right-right moist moist. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are too, too, there are the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are feel resistant and insoftening, a Rasender relay between contest and Streets.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is when the Olympic Fackel himself is a burning rod, which is protected from wristband to swimmers to the Turner for Triathlon.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not listen to the television set, a newspaper or to listen to your neighbours in the coffeshop, without more than Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the battle between Michael Pand Chad le clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games, and a women's black female dimples, could have made it to the Prime time, was set up with sponsors and well-looking-TV commercials, when he would be a swimmers, Turner or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the Olympic trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame was lit not exactly any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not widely accepted: aircrafts archery, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest and may be long-proof.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I don't want to make the arguments for my specific lovers, then leave me the attention to the discreet charm of the trampolins.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline is already a Olympic event since 2000, when it was founded in Sydney, the last 16 years, it was perceived that many who had asked me, did not know that it was a Olympic Games at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional Ignoranz.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA athletes voted for competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and won a athlete up until 2012, who made it up until the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadian for women to share women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong, China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping trampoline has a certain outsities, partially because it sounds suitable for the unreconnaissance ear passersed for a clownsschule as the Olympic Games sounds.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert but just a bit of enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is humorous potential - the cartographer quotation of his never-to-end teamming - but also the grazie of the sens and diving, the two sports which is essentially unites essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, what is so much means as "sprints."</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring winner jump on a giant trampoline, shooting almost up to 30 feet in the air and must have a number of lack of movements (threshing, hail and saltos) before putting them on your feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They will be evaluated according to the official Olympic Games, according to execution, difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two hundred athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women are competing in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic Vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medaillenhofftes must further expand in its streches to gold, faster, up to top and drover, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes, and back, down to the top and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">You do not only hunt for the finish line or the output wall, but in television communication also a further height of the world: the world or the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted Streets is nobel, wonderful value, even fanatic and it's enough to get even a spectators.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I want to look at the chance of these games as a bit more fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline is offering a breathing for the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Vector of the trampoline is top.</seg>
<seg id="32">The target movement is not the target.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or prallt, apparently heelos like a astronaut, goes down to top, then down to top, then down to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the target, no wölten in the heets, only the dreadmittal, elegant revocation of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is so Zen like the competition in the Olympics is only possible.</seg>
<seg id="36">Qualifying and end of women will take place on Friday in the Streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC becomes the final as part of an afternoon block to both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympic Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one who will probably see in general tumours.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the awareness was achieved by the anxiety and the lenses, the male US Turner at the The Wall Street Journal, recently, Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base to the air, the new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="3">Protesters, protesting political changes in Ethiopia are asked for a violent resistor of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that, protesters were killed during hussers with the police at Schussers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just try to break?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid balance of the West with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months, protests against the government and carried out more areas in increasingly areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people visited the streets and fundamental fundamental changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer of the government was unnoticed according to human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave to witnesses that policemen were killed and killed armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, the videos across the protests, which are probably from the last or early of this year, such as security professionals young people with bumps, whereas these were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights requires an international investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this land, and the future will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is estimated to have the most populated country in Africa and its stability to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians together to combat terrorist attacks on the region, in particular in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, as much Western assistance.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy continues to expand in a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new media train in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are normally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia had all other as a model for democracy, human rights organizations have been constantly increasing the suppression of the government - the Opposition in the country has been restricted to the silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or prison, were killed or expelled into the desert of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options except protested, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian Ethiopian. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation has been protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover all of the ground up to the sausage of power in terms of power.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far-reaching election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition and control now 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this shaky, controversial line called for hundreds of life.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst who fear the separatists, like the Oromo Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front, which were more or less than in the last years, the turbullets, and they might be armed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the biting after years before, Hinköchelns are explode under the surface of the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in the last years, many Ethiopian is able to communicate via the social media, as a cheaper smartphones have always been more common and improved the Internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, which they are in regular intervals, especially in the protests, so many people can communicate about the internet proxies which hide them.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave to them that they gathered themselves to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest Ethics in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are no natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Aeons prospered the Amharas, which come from aedics, mainly Christian High-countries, in politics and economy, while they are exploited by the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and are living in shallow regions.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that changes the changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to coordinate with a screen," "" "Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia has dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which account for about 6 percent of the population, and that are dominant in the military, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former Rebellenic, was up until his death in a non-profit illness in 2012, 17 years in Ethiopian prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactic genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly susceptible to do with an early signs of accidents, and to use special instruct to make opponents too, and to make them unharmful to opponents.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is missing at this fundamentals of this fundamentally," Mr. Abdi, a conflict in conflict.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively untransparent reasons to retake the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Otherwise, Mr. Meles, who came from the North of Ethiopian region of Ethiopians, Mr. Hailemariam from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he did not enjoy the trust of the tiray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many do fear that the result will be more bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time seen that Ethiopia has experienced a decision in 2005 after thousands of elections protested, according to the analysis of the analysts at the government, which were stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">While the following raid were killed, many protested, even if there were less than in the last few months, and this time the rest was relatively fast.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts dropping Ethiopiens leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, like the new Pendulum infrastructure, as well as its measurable progress in the poverty line.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this is not the Intensification of the Ethiopian Government of Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">The last month of print protested in gondar, an amese city, surrounded by Tigray, shops and hatred over the Tigray is increasingly commonly seen in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests are protests in the US and other Western associations in a well-like position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for Dronenflights on the neighboring Somalia, even if they recently concluded that the basis has closed this basis.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clear the democracy wants to support democracy, he does not want to merge to become a volatite area in a already volatite area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," Mr. Abdi, "says Abdi," is a very thin Gratest. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Common sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks come usually only in winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Hai was allowed to return to an investigation on board of the field of Sanna to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and is swimmers with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to date.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland got only with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the basis of the Greenland, the Greenland, at an hour he comes to an average of 1,220 metres far away.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only if it's a way, the five metre long animal accelerates on satte 2.6 km / h - and this speed is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This of long loneliness, however, seems to be a sponsorship for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues in the journal "Science" at least from a Greenland, which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Wahnmadness," commented on the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed the evolutionary biologist already exists long that Grönlandhaie are old.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is only lack of evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's Greenland are badly damaged, they live above all in the Eismeer - above the low populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because it prefer to temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they are diving at the surface usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">About the Lifestyle of Greenland, researchers have a little bit little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their timepentempo saw it, when they took six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey: in the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had shaded the pine bones of a young ice-bears.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly chase them sleep sleep or patrol on the basis of the ice meeres and search Kadaver that are out of higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Grönlandhaie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as co-catches of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest Hai was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, analyzed them with carbon-14 method of Haie.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of the eylinse is already produced before the birth of Haie, which are not renewed in it later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest Haie had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Its birth, therefore, according to the early 1960s, when nuclear experiments were larger quantities of the radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">The third-smallest animal contained in the lens of 220 centimetres, contained a low overpass to Carbon-14 in the nuclear power, it is likely to celebrated its 50th birthday at its 50th anniversary in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Grönlandhaie had the normal carbon-14-quantities that produces the atmosphere by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock was found for a 493 cm long Greenland for an age of 335 years, while the record Hai with 502 centimeters even is likely to be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai-females only then got up, if they are longer than four meters, it was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to reviewing the length of the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Because one of the animals with 392 centimeters are probably due to the threshold of sexual intercourse, and at the age of 156, Grönlandhaie became apparent for at least one-a and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this should be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That those methusaleme live above all in eisigen waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even the previous record holder, an 211-year-old Greenland, whose speck was captured by a 120-year-old harpoons, was captured by Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">By the low temperatures, often the body of the animals live on sparse.</seg>
<seg id="36">So tires later - and alant slow.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through the animal warmth.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than in one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smallish animal lives in mind and should focus on to focus as much as much as possible," says the evolutionary biologist Schrubbing. "</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal, however, should invest his resources rather in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="10">For a few euros, lovers can buy the devices on the Internet, but they come from the stone-age of the online age.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, 20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">A few months ago, the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced a few months beforehand at the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as "office in the Westland format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent to a lot: SMS and e-mails, and received by fax it was the Communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to websites was possible by HTML browser, even though query is slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and a electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be similar as a laptop.</seg>

<seg id="18">Quite proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average sales price of smartphones in Germany amounted at 392 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could happen in August 1996, that the Communicator would be the start of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The wise telephones are a success story, if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The cell division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented label, was finally sold to Microsoft.</seg>

<seg id="25">Ever since, it is online today, it is now for many people daily life.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">There were sold approximately 1.4 billion devices, in Samsung and Apple, of which alone account for 555 million.</seg>

<seg id="5">And we will come back, by providing new possibilities for local and firms in the vicinity of Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities we will create 10,000 new teachers, 40,000 new jobs, and the youth unemployment in the airport environment will prepare an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">As they were in London 2012, it will be such that the challenge of expansion Heathrow is big.</seg>
<seg id="8">I said that England has never be ready for games to be ready for games and that we will be able to hold on the world stage blaze.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two-fler had been wrong in 2012 and it will be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to the disappearance, but Heathrow answered the question.</seg>
<seg id="11">As the Olympic Games is Heathrow for many and not for individual infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">The expansion is a possibility to create up to 180.000 new jobs, £211 billion to witching growth and to leave their jobs at the airport as well as in all GB.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which has a £11 billion most expensive infrastructure programme in time and budget, from T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal has been built up to T2, which was built in the middle of the two frequencies.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to supply a third running, which is supported by £16 billion in private investments.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 2012, the 2012 games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="2">Venus was likely to be able to deal with the projections of a new NASA climate model, probably once inhabited.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of the NASA developed a model to explore the past of the Venus using tools and algorithms that are similar to those of climate agreements.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus is used with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously announced that the slow transformation of Venus could be explained due to their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that the Venus had had a thin, petroleum-similar atmosphere, and nonetheless slowly continue to continue.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model illuminated also the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet believed was probably more dry regions than the earth, but had once enough water and geographic stability to life in order to accommodate life to life and contacting quickly and contacting.</seg>

<seg id="11">However, private users were able to finish the change, but the change went down to company attacks in the past months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a Opfers, she is looking for unlong changing files such as Word-, Excel- or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the Ransomware and soldered the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software demands the demands of the Erpresser.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final turnkey code to the files, the victims must be money - usually in the form of Crypie Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where a private users will see the personal photo database on the game, it's going to be able to stand sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage increases, if a Ransomware increases.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies generated sales-loss by Ransomware, 13 percent, had to break up the business activities, in a case of life in life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several times were victims of attacks in attacks, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of nurse.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say the victims:" "", "says Kleczynski," says Kleczynski. "" "</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of the companies, who pay to pay their data.</seg>
<seg id="22">For Manager, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker turn again and try to build a good reputation in order to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the F-Secure safety researchers have examined the useful areas and contact with the outcome: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to build more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You declare their victims per chat, as they can pay per Bitcoin, free Support sites, or decrypt for free example-files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And private professionals are redeemed to payments of a few hundred euros, companies must pay some hard and five digit swmen to get their data uncrypt.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potential high and relatively high risk growth, the hacker are always professional and share the work, explains security experts from the antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a Ransomware about within one week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is unlikely that there are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmer sell their rescue software then in the form of a software construction to the actual pressing toner.</seg>
<seg id="30">The current malware Kit was created by installing the malware himself and additional tools for one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery is a adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Erpresser are looking for further hacker to spread the newly bought software under the victims of the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore, one of the forums in the subset, buys the set of a crime and commissioned a further to install the software on many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment takes place per inquiries calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals carry the crime with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known with many companies known to secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 per cent of the companies companies in the malignant-debate in the Malwarfare-survey rely on how Ransomware using file-Back-ups and scannersoftware can be applied.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators have already cleared new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is no longer sufficient threat to successful outcome more, the perpetrators are instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or price information," explains Malwarn-Chief Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thus, the damage potential, depending on the type of data is still a multiple of more than previously.</seg>
<seg id="42">Also, the perpetrators will continue to have completely new goals on the Internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the HackerConference Defcon demonstrate security researchers, how they could have received the thermostat to their control with the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation could be such a soldering heating so many such a soldering money.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators will then be able to block the heating into a factory block in a factory, Ransomware could also be subject to the Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, we travelled around at night, at night, the morning, in the morning, the wake-up should not remember sleep ahead of the wake-up of the wake-up.</seg>
<seg id="3">That's all other as a relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">Anyway, it is possible with such problems in good company: according to Robert Koch-Institut, it has about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than 10 per cent, are often common or permanently.</seg>
<seg id="5">How to have sleeping problems or sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there are many forms of sleep, emphasises Hans-Günter Week, member of the German Society for Schladerer and sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands of them, but the insomnie, thus allows an entry and sleep disturbing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just entering the journey there are many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht, is a member of the German Household association with practice in Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it, organic, psychological or contractual factors, but also for medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare, the sleep expression of a different condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early hair is often common in the depression," says Weak.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors are thanked.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, who has a herniated disc, it can be quite hard to reach all two to three hours and begins to keep silent on everyday life and guarantee, sprout is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to Anvoltage, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When it should be with sleeping disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who spend over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and have been infringed on the day, the doctor should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can be different different: it is beaten, tired, uneasiness, has trouble with attention and concentration, is easy to be easily able, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To linens the sleep disorder, it is important to figure out its causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options, including behavioural changes, a cognitive behavioural therapy, or medications - classic dormitories only in exceptional cases and most for two weeks - query.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany there is hardly ever there in Germany, in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze; head of the interdisciplinary medical centre of the Charité University Medical Center Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore it should be able to contact with sleeping on the housework, Cort Weak.</seg>
<seg id="24">The test can clarify if problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should happen to the sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the investigation in the sleeping laboratory in medicine, for example, for snapons with respiratory sickness, in disease wordness, or if you don't find the cause of a sleep disorder.</seg>
<seg id="27">For the investigation, we must not have to prepare itself.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day a normal day.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please do not make your lunch sleep," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the shortened time, one goes into bed.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body you can create a nose glasses, a chest strap, and a antennae.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera is dedicated to the ceiling in the sleeping area.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can be affected the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot, to which one can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weak counts on: regular sleeping and season times, not too sleep in bed, not to sleep on the day, not to sleep on the day, the alcohol is not allowed to sleep at the clock - then you'll find out immediately, and that's all not promoting.</seg>

<seg id="25">The largest part of Strains do not make nondamage, the tendencially rather the newbuildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the disputed level of 94, cannot be given by uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">In terms of violence, it is described: people in the 94 are their neighbours, which were not determined.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars give it directly in the Rīga longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, architect has been a criminal focal point, on the contrary, "here we helps each other, along with the street and gets more of each other than wounds."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is aware in the Rīga road and remained in the Rīga road.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore, it was so important that the natives are returned to their road: from the police, the politics and the media, which in July all suddenly won the Deutch nation in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of berries like Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away. by the most darless new buildings in former construction, the old residents of the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are two condominiums, which are not interesting for many here - here is more people who are not so good," says them.</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction is absolutely non guardian" "" "</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should make sure if a never someone else?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is an attempt on all sides of frustration, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For drawn, who caused about color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin project and the left scene belonged to the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who is herent, should be aware of this - just as someone who moves in a pub in a pub in which it can complain about noise for the noise of the noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All only with the names of those persons have been asked to be named, not with their right name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner for the integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July, Annika Deuschle also instructed the refugee camp for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It looks as a contact person for all actors, refugees, working groups, administration, authorities and who are otherwise miserable.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer wanted to show that the volunteers is more than grateful that Deuschle now is, the eives of Wollisau that has above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">In such a few - less spottest than rather, on the multitude of wish to wish to be targeted, confirming, when the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">We are looking for an administrative tensioning force with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, a eirouted Wollisau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle, writes of Deuka Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Especially to the organization, work with people on site and also behind the scenes and networking activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been around for six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent place on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was the highest time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle, and principal actors are supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon be new container in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem is, it has been approved for some time, the apartments have been recognized for interferries.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the connection, local communities are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="19">You need to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be equipped.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility was to replace by the federal office of the Commune, and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his home.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search goes for some time as a very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto takes the administration no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It has not so far not so far, we are involved in private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, basic apartments must be worn as it is so nice.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon the container will be installed in Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine Customer and Annika Deuschle were unanimous.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, there are training places, training places, school places, a-euro jobs and support for refugees and migrants.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine Customer Service. "" "</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help Hausmaster, do not do not do not do not do, and the motivated and very tidy, such as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">They hopes that the work has been working for a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But not only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a random sensation.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are part offers as sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">Thus, we skipped the administration and honors of the volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is centrally that the refugees get the feeling, they are in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">Long duration of the procedure should be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You have to explain the refugees that it lasts and the time makes sense, for example, with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever has the feeling of development, he could help him in Urbach would not work, will not work and be unprofitable, which will never be able to integrate it.</seg>
<seg id="45">The significant majority are motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But also, there is also a client, "people say," even if nothing is going to do. "the work of Deuschle and customer would therefore be more, other to motivate.</seg>
<seg id="47">Everything is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: have the two according to recent preparation of fear of radicalization, also in a small village like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine Customer "very clearly," what is "mancher naiv" "". "a residual risk could not be saved."</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitizes the helpers.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">The fear that the assassination attempt to bring them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"you want to show that they do nothing to do," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary volunteers have to hold on site and keep in the region after activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the background, they always have in the background that soon a new Stocks could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is too much to place them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach, we are still not since arrived, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the location.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine Customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher has already been able to integrate the previous people to be reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 persons, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">However, if people are in need of need to help them are both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political situation is so complicated, since there is no simple answers.</seg>
