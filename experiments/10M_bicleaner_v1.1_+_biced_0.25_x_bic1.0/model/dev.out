however , these are questions that may not answer any more .
after the flight from the campus , the police found a lam@@ bs trail when he comes back to Mississippi , Ar@@ kan@@ sas .

UN boss says , &quot; there are no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon , his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria , &quot; there is no military solution for nearly five years in conflict affecting armed weapons , violence and authority for millions of people .
the UN boss decided once again for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite , and integ@@ rative negotiations to the finding of a political solution .
during a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the setting of five permanent member nations of the Council , Russia , China , Great Britain , and France - at the edge of the Assembly of the Annual General Assembly , to meet the situation in Syria .
it is a regre@@ t that the sc@@ ath@@ ing in the Council and the regional people were in@@ soluble in the Syrian people , and the regional &quot; del@@ ays &quot; in the Syrian people . &quot;
Secretary of demanded of five permanent members in Syria to determine the crisis in Syria , which have proved solidarity and unity , prove it into the nuclear deal of a nuclear deal of Iran with Iran .
8 switch values , that can show that Corpor@@ al Donald &apos;s never is recommended .
some have attempted to see him as a flop .
others have done it as a jo@@ ke .
however , some people wait for a collapse .
but no matter how several Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper R@@ ession to circum@@ c@@ ask , there has not yet worked .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed that Donald &apos;s share in the double @-@ digit range , and some are getting to wonder what it means for the odds of nom@@ ination of the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l .
naturally , it is still very early in the elect@@ oral term .
nobody claims that tr@@ ump is probably win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts said that in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys passed the leadership of the &quot; Herman Cain , &quot; of which nobody made a state of rec@@ er@@ able production process .
there are many reasons why he could fight in a general election .
but out@@ working groups such as J@@ eb B@@ ush@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative daily Club for Growth are now watching Tr@@ um@@ ps bearing vessels , and start their dollar store to overthrow him .
here are some current description applied , which indicates that the real estate @-@ mo@@ gu@@ l is not only one temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Black measurements have a popularity rating of 180 degrees .
just before Donald &apos;s debut as announced in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ers showed the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l Real Estate .
by mid @-@ July , there were 40 percent .
in early August , there were 52 percent .
now , six of the 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have achieved a positive opinion of Donald &apos;s .
there are around three of ten tell that they have a negative opinions .
these numbers do so in early States .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ b fre@@ ac tool in I@@ owa has found that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have written a written opinion of tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ vot@@ ers GO@@ P would be happy with track plat@@ forming .
in a survey of CNN , OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans who would be either &quot; enthusias@@ tically , &quot; or &quot; satisfied . &quot;
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; le@@ ased , &quot; if he would be the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates approximately the same enthusiasm such as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent ) , they would be delighted with &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm is excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio is only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republican women seemed that they &quot; be satisfied , &quot; or called &quot; wonder why &quot; when J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ a , the candidate would be the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans sees a tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament of no problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bomb and vigor@@ ating testimony , 52 percent of the Soviet armies were said that the estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l is the right voting for a President , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first pre @-@ voting state of the State , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans think that he was the character of a Commander in Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ ac &apos;s last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think he was not the character to bring to effectively his position , and nearly six of 10 ri@@ ots are saying that his temper@@ ament is not the White House , such as ABC / Post .
republi@@ can elect@@ orate is strongly advised on the idea .
if they set up her money , republi@@ can elect@@ orate is plat@@ former for real .
if they are asked to take the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , in the most often the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say one of CNN Tibet / OR@@ C last week four of ten percent that plat@@ es@@ is the best bet .
this is an change since the date , when four of them gave money to J@@ eb Bush from the end of July .
full dis@@ closure : GO@@ P gears der@@ ers had in the past not the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ers that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination , only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P vot@@ ers tr@@ um@@ ps ren@@ ul@@ ers as chat as gar@@ b@@ bel .
even when the Repub@@ lic@@ ans fell in favour of a different candidates , tr@@ ump up almost everyone .
some experts estimate that the mining sh@@ atter@@ ing field is probably led to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is divided on more than a dozen of other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ heads between tr@@ ump and the most other Republican candidates , tr@@ ump @-@ owned shares .
so before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina rose 13 points , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , just 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points finally , and finally left off the side of Paul , John Ka@@ ker and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate , who suggests him ?
Ben Car@@ son would run the entrepreneur that 19 points putting a hypo@@ the@@ tical head over the head race at a hypo@@ the@@ tical head .
a tight majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ fans tell that they have formed their mark on their opinion .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday indicates that only slightly more than half of the vot@@ ers used to have plat@@ forming their vote , so they have set their voices .
of course , you can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never mind the opinion .
46 % said they will open the door to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition in the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers said that they have formed their mark , twice as often for tr@@ ump .
six of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with tr@@ ump on the migration of immigration .
since Donald &apos;s debut in his election campaign in front of two months immigrants from Mexico &quot; called his &quot; Im@@ migration , &quot; a Im@@ migration and fishing spot in public discourse in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic explo@@ iting from the vent@@ ri@@ ot movement of the Republican Party are con@@ sensus by the Republican Party and will damage the new commercial efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of the 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say that they are equal to the tions of immigration .
if the migration is slower in the spotlight , there will be Donald Mon@@ dump .
the fru@@ stration and the government can be climbed to new paths .
by Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , more than half of the support of Republican Movement , is chi@@ pped , predominantly by their out@@ si@@ can status .
six out of 10 rep@@ ub@@ ans said in the new Mont@@ es@@ e@@ pol@@ l by ABC / Post , they want to see a political elite runners as someone with government experience .
and they are also ra@@ ged to Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Classic / Bloomberg &apos;s in I@@ owa , published two weeks ago that three of the four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans over the Repub@@ lic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by 54 percent , &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; cour@@ ll@@ able . &quot;

in 2011 , here Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund will participate in Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
however , the Bavaria , in seven European ac@@ up duo were unbe@@ aten with Greek teams , would not be the next victim .
she went to brave the efforts to perform in their manifest efforts , but often of inter@@ s@@ essly .
the attacks were often re@@ inst@@ ated by a su@@ re@@ location on the left of Douglas Costa , with the previous Braunschwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ aou@@ i .

it &apos;s like Rum@@ our , &quot; Michigan , &quot; was the first part of a secret series : each of the 50 US states has to be played in a row .
but already in 2004 and in the heart of the Rhine already &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; appeared in the heart and breaks with a positive potential .

although almost 2000 guests are sitting in their chairs , the well @-@ known mat@@ ernity itself returns to the in@@ timacy and a folk group .
without a word to perform the audience , the group of excellent musicians have been enriched by the vast album .
from the audience &quot; one could hear : &quot; the lecture was &quot; opul@@ enter &quot; and one could throw the &quot; sla@@ p in a dry . &quot;

Jer@@ emy Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s de@@ buted in the qui@@ ped shape of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s has been made in the qui@@ zz@@ led Prime Minister since his election in 2001 .
the new Labour Party Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n was to enter his debut in David Cameron &apos;s primary findings from the Prime Minister . David Cameron wants to let his debut in David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is turned to meet the first of its six pre @-@ given questions shortly after mid@@ day , whereas his performance is likely to be tested from the media and the Labour Party from the proximity .
he called on &quot; less Theatre and more charges &quot; in this weekly event .
he has also said that he could jump over some sessions , to bring them to her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary tests to Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s , because it comes to his appointment to the shadow of the shadow , after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Exchange , at a memorial celebration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , was prov@@ oked by a number of those of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and will be at the center of several front pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s decision , won &apos;t be able to sing the National An@@ them , has attention attention .
a person to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had stood , &quot; resp@@ ect@@ ful of the crowd , &quot; and had recognised the &quot; hel@@ ms@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of the United States . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &amp; Kon@@ st@@ ett , Owen Smith , spoke in the BBC two night program , he spoke to the Labour Party , &quot; regardless of his belief that the monarchy was abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow Mini@@ ature has since refused to sell in Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s , and Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s has led to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than one @-@ sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party , he had supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent at the BBC Robin Bran@@ t said that political differences are also be st@@ acking within Labour &apos; and though Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s has made manifest to the position of European Union and to limit .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference to remove the Labour changes to remove the entire idea of a limit .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of the M@@ am and Secretary of the Party , Mr Smith himself said that the party &quot; become very clear &quot; only to limit the limit plans , and to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth discussion leader , with David Cameron , David Cameron , since he has directed the T@@ ory boss to the Dis@@ patch box in the past decade .
the Labour Party , who promised to participate in the other political group , says that he wrote &quot; crowd constru@@ cting &quot; ideas for questions on Mr. Cameron and had given him more than 30.000 applications .
Is@@ l@@ ington North Property is said that the latter &apos;s question@@ ing of the Prime Minister , learned that he is alleged to have under@@ go a stroke of &quot; com@@ batt@@ lements , &quot; and that instead , they had to focus on pretty serious issues such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eag@@ le will go to the shadow of Economic Affairs , when he does not take part , for instance , when Mr. Cameron is already on the road .
he also brought the idea to the conversation that other colleagues occasionally the word , and that he has given John Ber@@ cow , the spokesman of the Magi@@ que , to discuss the problem .
when he was established in 2005 , Mr David Cameron wants to be removed from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per le theater , &quot; who is often associated with the quar@@ ry of the Prime Minister . but few years later he was admitted to him that he had failed in it .
as they were sent to television in the year 1990 , the cargo will be taken over by a leadership of his leaders in the under@@ house and his position among his parliamentary colleagues , though the opinion leaders , it was upon a friend and created a far reaching reforms .

Met@@ cash ki@@ cks off the bottom @-@ reduction in control of al@@ di@@ - in@@ definitely
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the IG@@ A branches in front of a cooperation in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesale dealers in cash has launched a soil impact campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in advance to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di followed the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia as well as transportation and IG@@ A supermarkets setting their links with local food providers and build the IG@@ A brand through mainstream marketing and marketing of its soci@@ ology , as well as events like Adel@@ aide @-@ show .
Ig@@ A dealer and vendors can jump on board , with brands such as ic@@ producer S@@ imm@@ o made by D@@ uns@@ borough that is distributed in IG@@ A shops and shop owner , who sell tickets to the South Australian football league to faithful customers .
it is predicted that in cash for more details of his defense strategy , Sept . 29 , when the wholes@@ aler being specialised in food , alcohol , and equipment that are through its annual investors .
it stands much on the game , as South Australia and Western Australia are almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s IG@@ A shop shops and produces higher percentage points as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia have a unique market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia as well as around 14 per cent in Western Australia .
but believe such as Morgan Stanley , that Al@@ di will mature 12 months after the first place of food market in these two countries , and are available to all existing actors , but mainly for self @-@ derived retail sales .
according to a report published by the analyst Tom Ki@@ er@@ ath from Morgan Stanley , the IG@@ A retail@@ er will lose $ 360 million net sales per year and should lose some $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
the forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 branch offices in SA and 30 in WA , and will achieve a total turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
loss of loss in food and food business and on the amount of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s high fixed @-@ cost base may cost about $ 13 million in profit before interest and taxes , Mr Ki@@ er@@ ath is Mr Ki@@ er@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash has losing its shares in the Eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan .
Morgan Stanley assumes that you will increase at 3.8 % in the year 2016 , by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will strengthen its market share by 14 percent in 2015 to 10.1 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading Fon@@ ds@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , said that Met@@ cash is likely to leave in a decade . Met@@ cash disappear .
the cash could be extended , publicly disclosed to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that he has been a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market share has been reduced from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income came from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s food and food retailers , which has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , making its operational reduction in the company &apos;s debt reduction in terms of operating revenues and Mar@@ gen .
the wholes@@ aler being refused , and invested more than $ 150 million in selling prices for hundreds of products each week , and IG@@ A retail stores by improving their shops through a fast growing fresh food and deliver a better choice of private @-@ label food .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s chief business , Ian Mor@@ si says that the rate adjustments and store programme are targeted at El@@ an and hopes that the wholesale dealers will return to record growth in four years for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ akis is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ akis deser@@ ves more praise as criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ akis was one of the &quot; Koll@@ um disease &quot; in a recent storm that pri@@ med the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly will result more praise as criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ ar@@ akis , younger of the talented Du@@ os , was named as &quot; Special Forces . &quot; by the renowned involvement of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ r@@ asp@@ o , near Montreal &apos;s Masters shopping .
in the game of a fe@@ at@@ y qualification game in Cincinnati soon they had to be separated by the arbit@@ er and his opponent called Ryan Harrison who said , &quot; Wa@@ al@@ r@@ ka also gave birth to Bre@@ eding , and I should beat the kid . &quot;
while he was last seen , for instance , he made a tennis ra@@ cket after a wind @-@ fire victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , co@@ oper@@ at@@ akis was def@@ ending from he@@ aly resistance .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in finishing in second place at the single @-@ finals of Bernard To@@ mic in the Davis Cup final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an thing that I am quite happy with all over me , is the fact that in my view Th@@ an@@ asi , a little in the war , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is broken that he is broken through a sho@@ cking , but he is not the first player to have a pun@@ ctu@@ ally in the US Open , but he is broken through , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud .
but , really , he has spent the very good behavior in the US Open , even under the quite pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances of Harrison and so on , and I think it deser@@ ves much recognition .
he has a great team around , and got a great family around , and I think it was a little one out carefully .
he is a highly respected 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard and he who has never had a problem with the other players , he is his hard in the form , he is a very stable and advanced young guy , and I believe it deser@@ ves to be judged after his own services .
He@@ aly brought also the decision to take into account the decision not to take into account the decision on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right choice , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra , the company &apos;s long lasting li@@ fel@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team has all focused on the competition and is not on all of the control of contro@@ ver@@ sen &#91; Nov@@ a@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I think that Nick has made a very quick claim , where@@ with people like the Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray we have to try him to do so much because of the ra@@ mps that he can only think about because I was appropriate for the team , and it &apos;s best for the team , and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe of the refugee crisis : Hungary , not@@ ary , closes the limit , closes at the border .
Hungary explains the not@@ orious and dated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and was holding all of the country , to tackle the country suffer . everything went to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed on the border , as hundreds of migrants have committed themselves in a ki@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Indi@@ gn@@ ant personnel with indi@@ gn@@ ation .
the people who had fled up violence fled , for a unknown time in a strip of land along the road between the two control sites of the countries , and built there tents .
but they came to all .
when a police @-@ helicopter spread over them , the rock@@ over@@ threw the deportation , &quot; Insp@@ ire &quot; to the border ! &quot; and cried to the Hungarian ri@@ ot police .
some claims in protest food and water back .
Ser@@ bi@@ us Foreign Minister , said it was &quot; un@@ acceptable , &quot; that they would be returned from Hungary while more and more come from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to ship some of the solution and does not harm a coll@@ ateral damage .
you will have to take place in the coming days of talks with Brussels and other countries , &quot; I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
the tur@@ mo@@ il of the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came into one day after the 28 @-@ percent blo@@ c in a meeting yesterday in Brussels again no common immigration policy could be united .
however , the minister agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in over 15,000 people - or even until the end of the year - a agreement that the EU States would include another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
on Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria claimed to discuss the immigration crisis of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
but , Hungary , however , got his hopes on a soon @-@ balanced flight from Brussels , or its neighbours .
the emergency situation in two southern regions started on Tuesday , by giving more data to the crisis as they were able to move over roads and asylum seek@@ ers .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ an said that his country has also forced the construction of a bar@@ bed wire to Romania &apos;s border to stop the influ@@ x of migrants by the country , after the fence of the Serbian border ended .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent at the Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison sentence was used in the race , bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used .
during the last months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ ders from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , Hungary has become a considerable bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point for the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban had concluded that most of the next business @-@ fle@@ ets are in search of a better life , and not even more war crimes , which are entitled to shelter - a view that conflict with regard to other EU nations , including Germany .
the new laws made at midnight in Hungary the crossing of the border and the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high gates to construct the government along the southern border with Serbia , but also sentenced to a prison sentence for strongly sentenced to man prison .
&quot; due to the situation that resulted from mass migration , the Hungarian government declared a state of emergency , &quot; government speaker Z@@ olt@@ an Kov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eged .
we say it very much : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree that this trial is still approved for the next week , but re@@ porter from Associ@@ ated Press will have already paid at the border of heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security adviser for Or@@ ban , said that authorities spend 45 people in attempts to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .
they come , by replacing the fence , they are now in custody and , in which the laws of crimes under the new law .
no need to repair the fence .
Hungarian experts included two of the seven border check@@ ups with Serbia , after a train car with bar@@ bed wire , to close the borders .
chaos from the most important Gren@@ zen@@ los close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , to Hungary , opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of human being able to split into a human place to stop the closer .
about 20 have managed to get in , but thousands remained outside .
a further group of migrants , the most important motorway @-@ link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would come to food and water until they may come to Hungary .
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s head start at Ber@@ nie S@@ anders to national goal :
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton flew a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race in front of the nom@@ ination for national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders to get her opposite the ground .
in the meantime , Clinton defended the support of 47 percent of democratic rights during the presidential elections ( 58 percent previously ) , whereas S@@ anders is second , it was 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who is not announced in favour of the presidential election , receives full support from 15 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers .
more than five months before the start of the election , more democratic vot@@ ers say that it is too early to say that their opinion is dedicated to all candidates .
but Clin@@ ics supporters are speaking in their choice as the candidate of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost some impressions of demo@@ graphical groups , while S@@ anders some profits .
Clinton holds a big point on women and moder@@ ates , but it produces a far @-@ reaching team .
their support for the men is lower , and S@@ anders is just about 5 points back here .
Clin@@ ics of Germany is the benefit of democratic vot@@ ers under 50 years ago , Clinton and S@@ anders are now on equal heights .
Clinton has yet another advantage over the older vot@@ ers .
in the last month , Clinton was one double @-@ digit lead on the liberal , but S@@ anders has now has a 5 @-@ point advantage over this group .
about half of the democratic elect@@ orate of Austria , about half of the democratic election was to say that they would work with enthusiasm when it was nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support them with several pre@@ ference and an additional 15 percent would only support them because they have the candidate for the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
maybe not surprisingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are going to miss .
the opinions are stronger from the person who can not support Clinton - just about a quarter would discuss it .
while 48 percent of democratic elect@@ orate , Clinton interven@@ ed with enthusiasm , more than republi@@ can elect@@ orate , more than its leading candidate , Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ ard supports the candidate in an open question , it is the most common answer to it was the most common experience ( 16 per cent ) , followed by the fact that a woman is President ( 13 % ) and that it &apos;s the best candidate for the job ( 10 per cent ) .
Clinton &apos;s Secretary is also mentioned her conjunction with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
the agreement with the problems and the elect@@ orate is cited .
since the vice president is a potential for the French presidency in the Wa@@ ag@@ ic case , 57 percent of the democratic Command in the race will see him in the race - even though a third starts that he would not do it .
the democratic vot@@ ers will be asked to choose in a party , but for the party would have been her second choice , Bi@@ den is on top of the p@@ airing .
very Clinton &apos;s followers fell more than half , that Bi@@ den would be the second choice far before S@@ anders .
and decided not to nom@@ in@@ ate nom@@ ination for the nom@@ ination , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead to S@@ anders , 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race for 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of democratic vot@@ ers see Clinton &apos;s first opportunity to win the election ; however , this figure has fallen by 78 percent in the last month .
Bi@@ den is a second in this measurement , but the percentage that has risen as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , in the question then , what is important to become an important , the Democratic vot@@ ers call on the elect@@ orate .
similar to the last month , no other democratic party , or the potential candidate for the elect@@ oral , is present as un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidate or potentially candidates are supposed to provide good results in some important features in the elect@@ ors of the party .
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and st@@ worthy of powerful aid .
Bi@@ den ste@@ er with the three candidates best off , hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty per cent of democratic vot@@ ers believed to believe that Clinton doesn &apos;t be honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say the more than S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion from him .
democratic rep@@ lies in general , Clinton , S@@ anders and the ide@@ ology in accordance with their beli@@ efs .
with all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic crime he does not have a look at S@@ anders .
as questions came to Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of an old e @-@ mail address and a server for Secretary of State , most of the Democratic vot@@ ers must be satisfied with their statement by the matter and say that their opinions differ not much of the opinion .
but it is a different story in the American public .
the half of Americans now is still un@@ happy with their explanation as it is only about one @-@ third .
the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem was come @-@ up , fl@@ attered .
most Americans were saying that the email address and contro@@ vers@@ y did not have imp@@ acting on their general ground of Clinton , although 36 percent said , their opinion was still getting worse .
it is mainly rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 civilians who say that their beli@@ efs of Clinton became poor .
even though Clinton is regarded as one of the vot@@ ers of your party as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , it is still a problem for them under registered vot@@ ers . only 32 per cent see it as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , it is 8 percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voting rights don &apos;t keep it for a honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of voting rights are too fast as well as non @-@ honest and non @-@ tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump will get good notes at the lead .
from the six te@@ as were Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush the best at hon@@ esty .
a majority could be more than honest but , as did Car@@ son did many opinions of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic vot@@ ers have to be 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son wins the country @-@ wide pol@@ l behind Donald &apos;s dump .
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest p@@ olls of C@@ BS News / New York Times - behind Donald &apos;s
in the two candidates , half of the elect@@ ors from the elect@@ orate is short@@ ened in the new survey , and the more loos@@ ing strength stop .

but Car@@ son lost 6 % in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son from demo@@ graphical groups are good and are sur@@ ized with university education .
the rest of the Fel@@ ice , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Ka@@ jo , who was beaten with Wis@@ s@@ sins , Governor , and Walker , the one of the deepest , and despite less than 10 % of the last month now is 2 % .
former Florida @-@ governor , J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ sas , Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida U.S. Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third place with a 6 % overall .
the error mar@@ ge in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of the Republican Movement in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the newest CNN method , which was published last week shows that Car@@ son in the olls are rising - he lan@@ ces with 19 % support in the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the plat@@ former with 32 % .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post shows also a plat@@ es@@ lot in front of Car@@ son .
with a view over the last week of rising Car@@ son , tr@@ ump found some side @-@ gap for the former Neuro@@ sur@@ geon even after Car@@ son decided to put in this case to question Tr@@ um@@ ps faith in question .

five members of the Brotherhood , with the death of a baby wrap College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
nearly two years after a student during a student &apos;s student at Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ an appe@@ aled against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ book College of P@@ i delta leaders known as Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g was brut@@ ally beaten up and delayed his transport to the hospital , which was exposed to his death in September 2013 .
servants said that he had been thrown together with a 30 @-@ pound mar@@ sh@@ ack , and was repeated , and at the same time he was attacked , when he was trying to pass over a frozen field .
Mr. Den@@ g must compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he felt un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i Delta @-@ PSI @-@ bro@@ therhood is not the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was sum@@ med up and waited an hour before they put him in a hospital , the police .
they had , however , change the time to change sell their symptoms , and create his symptoms , goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , become the general President of the Brotherhood to take counsel , &quot; said police drawing , Chris Wagner at a press conference .
so &quot; at this point the members , U@@ ten@@ ls began to hide and have the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle conducted by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; says Poli@@ gra@@ ef Wagner .
he was not revi@@ ved , and he died on the next morning to his injuries .
after an automatic selection period , Den@@ g have been repeatedly used with stum@@ bling or serious injuries on head , tor@@ so &apos;s tor@@ so and upper th@@ igh@@ bones .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Muslim Brotherhood . at least one student died in 1970 every year , says Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ o family , in a statement .
brood @-@ con@@ vey@@ ors and its members have to be pulled to the comp@@ utation , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e anticip@@ ates that for murder &apos;s third parties in the first five members .
two @-@ thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , is also charged with the serious attacks and education of a criminal organisation .
&quot; we would not only do the participating people in involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - this way , we will also read this on the basis of technology , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ book College has banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has resi@@ sted its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases the interest
a vermi@@ lion which does turn left , and the house will get down to the fuel consumption , yields on bonds , and the economy is triggered in a recession .
we know .
what we do not know how long will last long and how long it will hold .
in particular , the history of the economy only offers small manual to the expi@@ res .
a recession occurred within just 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
ag@@ am@@ anti@@ le of Federal Reserve at the increase the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor ampli@@ fying the economy and the financial institutions .
therefore , representatives of the US bank &apos;s Central Bank also stressed that investors is unable to focus , while they starts to increase the interest rates , but rather in the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
indeed , several variables play a role in this .
however , in the end , market participants would recognize that the whole excitement was possibly connected due to a zinc age .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed decades since the global financial crisis will be interpreted as a signal to the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; in the end of the project , &quot; said Julian Maj@@ so@@ p , Chief econ@@ omist at Capital Economics , who stated as a notification in a communication .
however , in contrast , we anticip@@ ate the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still on low level to fear to the se@@ is@@ mic shock they seem to fear damage .
that does not mean , that there will be no effect .
here is a historical trends , based on historical trends , like some areas of the economy would react :
as the market has seen last month , the pre@@ po@@ tions of interest items will make things for a while .
once an enhancement will occur , the influence is not so dramatically .
this seems to be a tendency to reflect around 12 or 24 months after the first increase in order to reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; the Deutsche Bank Analy@@ ses in a recent study of what has happened to the interest of the F@@ ed .
more specific , the market is generally higher in most recent years - roughly 14 per cent . following average income after 500 days , by an average return in the previous six recent cycles by 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , Bob D@@ oll , Head of Strate@@ gic Asset Management , near Bar@@ ron &apos;s Asset Management .
the German Bank said that the impact of the shares will occur later in the elev@@ ations of securities and the return at this would start to reduce it .
Rez@@ es@@ sions are a fact of business life , but vermi@@ lion , and often promote .
at the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not accelerate the recession .
extremely interesting is here that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point for the interest of the F@@ ed .
according to the Deutsche Bank , 118 patients who have cir@@ cled it only twice the nominal GDP twice below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , just a few , that this will under@@ go and expect to return to the third quarter according to the Atlanta Center , just 1.5 percent .
interest rates in a so @-@ gil@@ ant economic point , may be his reaction to , &quot; If it is different , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said .
market participants have made a whole year on the interest of the F@@ ed handled , and all eyes were addressed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econ@@ omist believe that FO@@ MC could remain an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trade is only a likely increase of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study , all production cycles have taken place from 1950 to this day in a super cycle with increasing spon@@ ge of GDP and on @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ism very quickly since the beginning of recovery in the sh@@ adows , &quot; says the report .
as opposed to this , it is a clearly visible recovery of what the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest winning the F@@ ed has been waiting for the late recession , the record was 35 months , and this is so far 74 months .
the fixed income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , since the market had a vermi@@ lion , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds are faster than in shares if they change its strategic move .
when bonds are to be seen in the return per turn , as soon as the first increase in lowering will take place over the cycle .
at the end of the enhancing Cycle , the An@@ lei@@ her@@ ites announced plans to leave the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Schw@@ ab shows that the increase in interest rates will result in a margin between longer and recent bond issues are exp@@ elled from a curve on the curve .
we are often bring in such a climate better result , although &quot; we are going to be careful in such climate change , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ zer in Schw@@ ab , &quot; said in an analysis .
in interesting case , Jones is saying that the markets have already been targeted in the F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation devices , there are some evidence that the market has been adapted to the more stringent quality policy . &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , increasing interest rate is fl@@ atter , lending they have increased out and the vol@@ atility has risen - all characteristics of the market once the F@@ ed its tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in the major and whole country , companies that will make the major part of their business activities in the USA , can benefit from it interest rates and local products are more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are being ret@@ ched , as rising money will lead their products on the global market , and will also support the financing of their debts .
the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares will tend to react extremely positive , three months after an initial vermi@@ lion , &quot; says Gold@@ man Sachs Analy@@ st , in a report for the customers .
firms with strong balance sheet companies have exceeded the average rating of 5 percentage points over each of the reporting Assembly of 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low income levels are also entitled to their share of low quality , 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
corporations with a high share of flexible interest are loos@@ ened on the most , but Gold@@ man said .
outside the energy games , consumers will also benefit steadily by the rising dollar .
savings can see prizes by higher yields , even if experts are in different opinion , how fast it will occur .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , the Par@@ liam@@ entary Station Andrew B@@ ingham
the con@@ doms became a member of the parliament , critic@@ ised the transmitter because of his &quot; dum@@ b &quot;
he argued that he is increasingly distinguish from commercial p@@ vals .
he has also played on the BBC Music Awards , and said they were only The Br@@ its i@@ mi@@ cide

BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , &quot; claimed by a leading parliamentary plane and then move new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he is something to do the private radio station .
the con@@ doms of Andrew B@@ ingham said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen also told the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen &quot; the publicly post @-@ legal radio station &quot; and is increasingly important for its commercial competitors .
&quot; radio &quot; it seems - I don &apos;t use the word &quot; ir@@ um@@ men &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM . &quot;
he was also involved in the BBC Music Awards , started in the last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started in the past year , seem to be just under one name .
so if you try to do something else - this are two spont@@ aneously @-@ mentioned examples , where you actually only use the i@@ mi@@ zation , which is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
the BBC General Manager rejected the alle@@ g@@ ations and argued that the BBC Radio 3 goes well before his commercial character upon doing live music and the information on the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 ler@@ ne , that I &apos;ll learn more about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really un@@ surpassed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , new music , and new works are to be put in order that I really feel for important , &quot; he said .
at the beginning of this year , the BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , argued that harder had to be engaged , the audience had so righ@@ tly put this in the past because the British have not informed about any classical music .
but Radio 3 was not the only element in the BBC production , which during the exc@@ ur in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport that serve on fire , the commercial rival to the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dami@@ en Collins and The Voice to - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ .
see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not especially mark@@ ant ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Justice - &quot; was produced on special BBC movies .
in addition , he added the company , wishing to find the company &quot; a hit from our company &apos;s own foundation , &quot; when it was the next time a source of entertainment .

while net sales rose in August the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 there were 7 percent increase in online sales .
last month , the lowest since the start of the record in 2000
sales growth increased three years ago by use of cell@@ phones for single @-@ sale
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has been slow@@ ed down .

the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase from the previous year .

it &apos;s imp@@ lied that more people were online , and that people do do this in different environments , for example at home on the sofa .
however , we comm@@ uted to stay , and we may experience sure that the growth is less@@ er .
the Black Friday phenomenon which was imported from America , is quoted as a reason for the dis@@ appoint@@ ing sales .
experts believe that buyers sign their sales outside the event , which will take place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers was about their computer to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites rose up .
experts estimate that Black Friday are taking advantage of the buyer for bar@@ gain drop , buyers of it might be able to pass through .

B &amp; Q Recorder is said that time is aimed at bil@@ low East European craftsmen .
the British occupied increasingly skilled workers , &quot; says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified professionals from Eastern Europe has remained rising .
this means that 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix charges to be paid to handi@@ craftsmen .
at the same time , King@@ doms has managed 60 B &amp; Q shops .
headed by Rupert Steiner , City @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Britain is trying to perform their h@@ amm@@ ers and brush in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European tra@@ des@@ people who perform the work in their home .
if you can then go together with a hammer or a brush for buildings , you may appear to be a minority .
as British have become increasingly skilled workers to perform DIY @-@ jobs in their homes so the company was behind B &amp; Q &apos;s CEO .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , a new Managing Director of King@@ bald , who has made the tree @-@ hardened business sector , said that a huge increase in the number of qualified professionals from Eastern Europe has over@@ taken the services to the low price .
therefore , King@@ searched , 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops open to open up and close up 60 selling set of B &amp; Q .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry told her that there would be more women in B &amp; Q &apos;s shops , since eight of ten buy bonds in store are hit by women .
at the moment the men took care of the staff .
in this way , it is necessary to submit to the growing demographic trends that employ more female single @-@ households that have more renovation than in the past .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry told : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches .
we need to move stronger in a balance .
basically , half of our customers coming from women with 80 percent of all decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women plays a major role in decision @-@ making process .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry , who listed one of the top five women in the face of a British ben@@ im FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also benef@@ ited their top team in order to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .

Fun@@ c@@ ess@@ ments of ai@@ ch / DO@@ B for un@@ faithful before the Court
at the State Court of Klagenfurt , two officials of the Austrian renowned Austrian Vice @-@ Chancellor , ai@@ ch / DO@@ B , have to reply for un@@ faithful and dis@@ appearances .
the def@@ endants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them also been accused of abuse of abuse .
by this preparation , he was acqu@@ itted in May of final judgment .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , Robert Ri@@ ffel found out that the def@@ endants from 2006 to 2011 will be collected from the United States where they were disp@@ oni@@ zation in their functions , and used for private purposes .
there are damage to around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports functional are also charged with financial services .
this facsimile book was out of the President of the Sch@@ öff@@ er , Judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it is to be negotiated with later date .
for the lack of the faithful Bible , the defence demanded that the association was not grown in a fortune .
the sport broad@@ casts could not have a decision @-@ allow@@ ance for whom she has been working for them in 1982 to 2011 and had invested much time and money in the debt . the Passi@@ va was around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( around 4@@ 4,000 euros ) in 2001 .
&quot; back then we were in front of the situation : we invite the Club to ? , &quot; he told me one of the accused , in the car@@ ving grand scale of the financial market .
with his colleague and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take this task .
risks .
&quot; we have you up money for the money , &quot; our life @-@ insurance plans have turned out , &quot; he said to him .
by the association , it has been agreed with the association : you can freely manage the money , there are only no debts .
in addition , for the withdrawal of financial success , the withdrawal of declar@@ ations of damage has been implemented up to 1991 .
therefore , I have a part of the decision @-@ made reference first only years later , that from 2003 when a plus would have been under the account .
in the case , if you would like to put forth and not express , explained the former Ob@@ serv@@ ations , the former Ob@@ serv@@ ations .
the accounts and savings accounts , the two accused , said the second accused .
why the pay@@ outs has not been published in detail , the judge asked the judge .
the association was not interested in detail for the financial matters , i.e. , only the debt of the debt service is that the answer .
in 2011 , as in 2011 , against the investig@@ ative investigations against abuse of abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the United Kingdom .
these were the accused , being the indic@@ tees .
this securities rate was based on the name of the second def@@ endants , and , according to the Association not known , refer to the Association .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
after , the interview had not had any answer .
he then said he ultimately , &quot; he believed that this was the best for the association .
if something had happened something happened , nobody paid a bit of that money , the At@@ tor@@ ney had sitting in the room .
the def@@ endants must have been informed , justi@@ fies the function@@ ary .
this transfer was not issued as &quot; damage substitute . &quot;
why do not want to act drugs ? , I had to know the judge and attorney general .
the first accused proclaimed it of having been obliged to dis@@ agree with this formulation , because the association was never been created in damage .
but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; with you are all of the Schneider . &quot;
&quot; I am a legal representative ? , &quot; he asked .
in addition , the function@@ ary did he never really had a cent discount . if it is estimated for kilomet@@ er@@ change and di@@ ets .
in di@@ ets , for example , he for@@ got to pay 1,000 euros a month in advance , the actual cost is much higher , added to it .
precise data for the early years could not mean the def@@ endants .
these are not been tested for an operating insp@@ ections , where everything has been judged as correct but not more .
the kilomet@@ er@@ change had also susp@@ ect the second accused in relation to .
all methods of housing made in cash , for example , to lead it from his residential site for the Bank to Blei@@ burg , he declared his statement .
the main negoti@@ ation is being continued with the testimony of witnesses on 23 September .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard detector further 30.000 jobs
in addition to the operation of three years , the computer ri@@ ese will continue to build further jobs during the ride of the company .
the sub @-@ sub@@ missions out of the US computer system Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) can &apos;t find any end .
as part of its restructuring process , the US technology group is planning to disman@@ tling the reduction of 25.000 to 30.000 places in its corporate customer base .
in this way , the company should be saved in altitude of 2.7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) , as the company was saved on Tuesday .
the step will result in a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will drop down from the fourth quarter .
the mining of 5@@ 5,000 jobs have still not been completed .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP had some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
rep@@ uted by the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share were 2.3 percent .
the California @-@ based Palo Alto , currently includes : &quot; new business and print business is still set to bund@@ les in a new company - separated from the future prospects for computer ser@@ ver@@ n and data store for companies as well as other services activities .
both partners are to be listed on the stock market .
a dis@@ appoint@@ ing PC sales unit , as well as a we@@ aker demand for corporate clients , came to most of the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer based in Len@@ ovo .
for the third quarter of July , sales of PC and printers were dropped by 11.@@ 5 % .
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .

time of decision to interest rates for the US dollar &apos;s
the world is observed , if the US Emergency database was two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to make the crucial decision to be raised to interest for the first time since almost a decade of interest .
a survey conducted by Reuters , who were asked about Reuters , took that a little more than half , that the fact that F@@ ed will consider the fact that the F@@ ed will hold a longer longer , and interest rates will remain at its current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 per cent .
it is a historic event because it occurred seven years ago since the F@@ ed interest in NU@@ LL was at NU@@ LL .
we are for the first time in a situation where a large Central Bank will leave the zero value and will start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Managing Director at the Peter@@ sons Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is represented on a relatively good level , trillion dollars is added to balance sheet and generate only a small level of inflation .
however , the F@@ ed can not ignore the fewer than global matters .
she warns you because of the markets , to prepare an increase , but the signs of the signs pointed out such a step .
the decision was to announce the Thursday at 8.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday .
death protective at Delta State University ( left eye )
after shooting and killing his friend in Mississippi , Monday morning - before he wrote his colleague wanted a note , so he wrote about a note , so that he cannot take him out for the first murder while he believed that he could do so , &quot; said the authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that Lamb is a lecturer of geography and Social Education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 in the morning .
he said , he shot himself ob@@ s@@ shot and someone else .
L@@ AM@@ B said the staff of the emergency call , to send the police police to his home .
he said that &quot; I shot his wife yesterday evening , and he mentioned the fact that a &quot; sweet dog &apos; is in the house but it has no trouble . &quot; but probably one is excited to be rolled out . &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he didn &apos;t exist any .
L@@ AM@@ B there was no explanation for his shots .
as the police marked the scene , they found the body from A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ s , 41 , and a handwritten notes of Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I just wanted to re @-@ take it yet .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman I loved me ever . &quot;
after writing the notice of we took about 300 miles to Delta State University , where he answered E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history and killed , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police officers rose him .

in spite of reports on Monday , the Lamb is allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ s also made a relationship with Schmidt , saying &quot; don &apos;t give this &quot; any information , no Evi@@ dence , &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
pr@@ enti@@ cer was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were about seven years old when a &quot; good man &quot; was described .
the two were di@@ vor@@ ced at 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ cer said a daughter , that 19 is , and they be &quot; at the bottom . &quot;

Luke Shaw by Manchester United can not play monthly due to dual @-@ t@@ inc@@ ture
this was like Luke touch with the Champions League &apos;s defeat in Manchester at PS@@ V Eindhoven won a double inc@@ ture of its right leg .
while this brought out the left of the State , it brought him to battle with him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al has no hope that Shaw can play back in this season .
the injury was prec@@ eded by a failed attack of H@@ é@@ ari@@ ctor Moreno in the 15th century , after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Shaw was one in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated in 9 minutes on the field and required oxygen , before he was taken to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg inc@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will begin tomorrow , or perhaps one day later , and then in Manchester .
it is a fear@@ ful thing that comes with 18 at Manchester United , it &apos;s really hard to play and then was fantastic , and then happens .
in the cabin , he had a oxygen @-@ mask .
he we@@ aken .
I am not a doctor but if you have a double tail , then the six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Moreno held happ@@ ily , a Kh@@ der card and the block@@ age of a Elf@@ enstein .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er and has not been pun@@ ished , has not been pun@@ ished .
in Ga@@ al , the Italian arbit@@ rer in 2007 was mist@@ aken .
they can be compared for yourself , when I say , I@@ vory , and a red map .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a role to Sha@@ ws account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe them like broken , I am , my way to recovery will start , I get stronger back . &quot;
prior to this : Manchester United States was suffering the loss of Luke Shaw , by the defeat in the PS@@ V
the England def@@ enders has reached an additional incentive to arrive to the European Championship in France to recover from this end of June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , who has PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves that kind of violation of injury the place , all are very sad above .
it is never the intention of one of our players to ob@@ ser@@ vere these opponents .
Moreno @-@ Managing Champion suffered a leg press against Van Ga@@ A &apos;s Holland team at the end of 2014 .
&quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to ob@@ ser@@ vere these opponents , and if you are hearing that there is a very bad injury , &quot; Co@@ c@@ u says , &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in another direction , so that it looked , as if he was touched upon by doing , but I was unable to see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with SB@@ S6 I said : &quot; I know how it feels like it feels like that I know , I know how hard so that .
I feel very po@@ or@@ ly using . it is sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital after a f@@ oul@@ match by Chris Sm@@ ack .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a matter that will learn all her parents : if your child does not love one book , it will not take anything until you know it for almost .
it may be , you might be David Cameron .
when he was asked of a supplier of child care systems , his favorite children book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , decided to place the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax in 1971 , decided in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron speaking in a news on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continued : &quot; fun , driving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book which I would like to read my children , because there seems to have an image or a message that we missed out . &quot;
everything beautiful and well , except for the following paragraph , that Cameron is said to be the act of written results , instead a content from the film version of 2012 will be added , which added new characters and details to be extending the pretty little original text .
&quot; in the most important town of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone , he is hoping to see a real tree that is filled with her own desire to see it . &quot; a declaration of love was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was situated at Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage and who died in 1991 .
if the text was not the case you were still lucky enough , to look at the website of Lor@@ ax movie , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally venti@@ l@@ ated and even the air is a commodity , he says that T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , is trying to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
even though he says that Cameron &apos;s actions is not familiar with him , it seems that Cameron is a little ones , like the local environment , despite the protests of the Finn@@ s Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ish , corro@@ sive being , &quot; which says in the name of the trees , &quot; devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task for a hel@@ per segment that The Lor@@ ax was to have read the last 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning @-@ Street speaker , said that the text might probably come from cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s elect@@ or office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was supplied to Cam@@ er@@ ons with no other main comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was obviously threatened by the conclusion of a team of England , but it is still difficult .
in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , it is a difficult task , but if one has chosen the he@@ aders to the UK for the tour , a repeti@@ tion of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my map .
I would not take a better win of the victory .
A@@ last@@ air Coo@@ king side is possibly more experienced than the three years ago , but there are a good spin @-@ player in the Batt@@ lefield list , and the community is strong ; it will be sc@@ ars by 2012 , only a adol@@ es@@ cent positive attitude .
with the ball developed , Mo@@ een , as a spin @-@ Bow@@ l and adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size to test level , is an option for the attack .
information of this product : Adam Ly@@ th Cru@@ det , from the England @-@ Test @-@ fa@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is difficult for me as his leader in Yor@@ k@@ shire , Brazil .
in his seven tests there were also good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ cket@@ PC are aligned on results .
there has no question characters at Joe &apos;s oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , and I have said these again - players have chosen to choose their own best views .
a long ago , man would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had the control of his own fate .
if he &apos;ll be released more nights for Yor@@ k@@ shire country and comes another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he brought not the good performance , and that was surprised me , he is especially a team man .
the question of how much time is a test man , to be his sign , is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven opportunities - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - while Nick Comp@@ ton did 9 .
just Comp@@ ton got the chance to win home and back@@ wards .
the only first throw to make sure was that England contained in the Caribbean at first Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is now , and it is a drum , which I highly switch .
he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket@@ player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he saw 2@@ 36 at a tr@@ ent bridge with us in order to hit us .
he must have at least the same chances of receiving him , but this depends of course influenced by the Group &apos;s presentation in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea , to leave Mo@@ een in addition to cook , is a extra spin @-@ off Bow@@ l and bring four steps to start , di@@ ved , and I didn &apos;t get anything against it .
I don &apos;t see why there is a stroke playing there , and this left @-@ h@@ anders has already been shown that it is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket .
Mo@@ een has probably tried his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire country , but he is not a number 3 in her , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop in 2001 before he joined the Opposition in 2001 .
he has cut off three hundred kilometers immediately , and didn &apos;t look back .
Sal@@ ar As@@ ari comes in the K@@ ader as Back @-@ up Sp@@ inner , and in my own dealing with him , he was impressed by a young man .
people might see their statistics on average for 31 using the bats and 35 with the ball - and think it is a p@@ unt but there are no big number of backup persons who get their hands and the coach have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot at this tour .
in addition to the team , U.@@ S has taken a few cl@@ ad@@ ditions to the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ a , the b@@ ats@@ man of Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the trial could be a master coup .
this is one of the n@@ ett@@ est guy of the game who will bring an abundance of experience , since he played with all the conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball phase of the tour and brings up power and powerful use in the setup @-@ setup configuration .
I always felt that he created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and how Mah@@ ela has the insight , of whom we can benefit .
sometimes , new voices rose even in the changing cabin of fresh wind , even if the messages are in line with the prior request .
coll@@ age @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part .
some would not agree to agree , but coaching , and team operators did not define the schedule .
and they must remember to remember that , as of the players , your jobs are app@@ ended with the results .
such decisions being made not easy @-@ to @-@ heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ ite @-@ camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = authorized UK ) from the EU could be eliminated at Zul@@ u if the economy is moving to a Fl@@ au@@ te by 2017
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ signed a new vice ch@@ dra@@ tion strategy to hit the UK in the EU , but without the choice of genius &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which are torn off for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ag .
as a European diplom@@ at , in fact , a European diplom@@ at friend , said that some states - deep desper@@ ate for various states such as the EU is not on their own fault , but Britain &apos;s own agenda with foreign explo@@ sives , and of the following contra@@ cting parties that are not interested in vain .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton the TU@@ C decided upon their annual meeting that this also does not like to risk your social protection .
we could also call it at Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister are climbing on the summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they will be responsible for reforms .
it is always about me .
my European friend , who wishes to f@@ use the UK back in the face of the EU , says Berlin - and can look back that over and more short , among themselves , and officials from some major cities to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or go .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel was a pro@@ vice president , but she has been in power for 10 years before she was bad for them , just as it was ill for ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated ten@@ si@@ veness like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France François Hollande looks back on its re @-@ election or his replacement by 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ ass@@ ant power .
Poland has probably a nation@@ alist right government , Spain on left wing .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that they will get a bite , but it would be better to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie so that Scotland &apos;s outlet should leave due to the UK - something that they should not want because of the most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies lead .
therefore , some such actions can be identified , not helpful comments , all in the SN@@ P style , while the UK referendum to accelerate the break @-@ up process by a break @-@ up process , probably my friend .
&quot; The New negoti@@ ation was a Ple@@ ite , &quot; and &quot; Great Britain , has nothing to do solely from the new action . &quot;
the Europeans know how often the Fle@@ et Street on their costs , and what EU sc@@ ep@@ tics could be the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons , as they were found during the publication of Tony Ben@@ n inspired by 1975 , who supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
she may righ@@ tly be home to Boris Johnson who will certainly remember Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ism , who has made a name for an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade @-@ ban@@ ana &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 years .
in all his missions , Ed Mili@@ band , who had his enemies were .
this was part of the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear @-@ flo@@ wering , direct @-@ sailors and pseu@@ do non @-@ in@@ lets who own most of our big newspapers .
actually , Tony Bla@@ ir took similar to them , but noted that if one is situated using a hot Gor@@ illa in a c@@ age , make a ban@@ anas get better , rather to di@@ stract him instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact , the band had adopted more Bla@@ ir after the first civil war in 1979 , Bla@@ ir specified the principle on which the Constitution of the EU were rejected by the French and Dutch citizens in 2005 which opened a back door .
the press has never missed that .
but the nice Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n that gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on the back , I told him that he didn &apos;t have time to repeat edly for me - even in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ phy &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ th years to repeat a f@@ law at that time and today .
it may take a co@@ her@@ ent development strategy to gain the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa , he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s official position to Europe is - I were kind of course - in the development process .
he states that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps , a traditional blue @-@ ye @-@ tendency and wil@@ ds of por@@ to Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say this with them .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in Radio and TV in the Television this week , was not admit that Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s appointment of prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as well as a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father dev@@ out@@ bound himself in television , faithful to his Labour Co@@ ett@@ lement , and to come up too far away and to his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; under any circumstances - Benn@@ s say - was not this one , what Mc@@ Don@@ nell finally said that J@@ C told the Mit@@ ro@@ ben@@ ites and parliam@@ ent@@ arian after all reports on their bur@@ u day on Monday night .
what should I connect to the be@@ ating bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n , remember that he even takes me - an un@@ ag@@ hr@@ t number is important in the age of TV around the clock in the Stru@@ del of the soci@@ ology of Social Media , a brut@@ alism of par@@ an@@ oia and betra@@ yal .
it is true that Cameron is not allowed to enter Europe as a ticket for Europe who allows him to give Lab@@ ours to hold a &apos; discussion campaign for a natural choice , such as Mc@@ Don@@ nell it .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think is safe .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s are basic am@@ big@@ uous for EU membership in accordance with her Benn@@ ite siege , to their anti @-@ capitalist past , not only a matter from visiting the left dis@@ sident , for which the Nar@@ c@@ issi@@ m of small sub@@ mis@@ sive is a central principle of do@@ gmati@@ cs .
as with his am@@ big@@ u@@ sive approach for NATO , Tom Wat@@ son is stretched , that J@@ C didn &apos;t leave a campaign to the exit , foreign diplom@@ ats are not required to try to find yourself a sense for their superi@@ ors .
why should not be restra@@ ined from Paris or Berlin , but they have also looked at the attempt to make the British - so it &apos;s a bit point@@ less when this is point@@ less ?
the U.S. are already quite dis@@ appointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government on power , which was reminiscent of my start on Monday , which was called the British Real Estate Forum .
experts critic@@ ise the report by Public Health England across E @-@ cigarettes
in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alle@@ g@@ ations of a state @-@ funded agency , &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are less hazardous as &quot; smoke emerged from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , &quot; said . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined the British Medical Journal ( PH@@ E ) at their report on e @-@ cigarettes in their report .
PH@@ E released the &quot; progress report &quot; in the past month and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have raised the load capacity of this text and rejected the links between some professionals and the tobacco industry .
as an article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month , the &quot; original win@@ dy basis , &quot; based on the PH@@ E was the most important conclusion .
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the alle@@ g@@ ations are able to build &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ demi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health that strategies are based on the detection of efficacy . &quot;
they gave what the public asser@@ tion that the asser@@ tion of PH@@ ES is that &quot; the present best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes around 95 % are less harmful to smoke in a detailed review of rep@@ elling and modelling in modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people that was sum@@ mon@@ ed to develop a model for the damage of various Nico@@ tin @-@ containing products for syn@@ thesi@@ zed products ; the results of the meeting were consolidated in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director will have received prior to British American Tob@@ acco Food ( BAT ) .
he also wrote the references of BAT / Public Health in an sustainability report , said they .
one of the 12 participants to this meeting was added to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing , which he will receive reports about the to@@ e company Philip Morris International to be added to reports .
the reasons for the selection of members of the Gre@@ y@@ ums are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champions , with some of them a few others in the paper .
some other participant at this meeting are not known for its know @-@ how in the tobacco control .
in the meeting the Tab@@ ak headed by PH@@ E was also part of the meeting .
the group &apos;s research project is established that there are a lack of &quot; hard substances for the risk of most products , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well , says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , no such connections can be discussed in the PH@@ E statement .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the alle@@ g@@ ations of PH@@ E announces that &quot; there is no proof of evidence that E @-@ cigarettes than a path to smoking &apos; kids or non @-@ smoking animals are used .
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of Health and well @-@ being in PH@@ E , said that in the alle@@ g@@ ations of the BM@@ J , it had already been re@@ acted .
he said : &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are significantly less harmful to smoke . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smoking dies of its view@@ finder .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes a comparison are small , however , that we continue to study the long @-@ term impact .
PH@@ E has the unique obligation to information the public over what is proof of evidence and what does not know about the confusion about the relative danger in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people die each year in a single illness with respect to smoking , and smoke costs the National Health System , which is £ two billion per year .

the former President of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop , programs like Vol@@ ts and The Voice Command , &quot; he said that commercial p@@ aus@@ al &quot; would give her right arm , &quot; for hit shows as Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the Broadcasting service should only be used to do the kind of programs that may not be broadcast by other UK channels .
for that , he critic@@ ising the BBC monitoring that they will probably see public @-@ legal programs , which likely to be seen from a smaller audience , as the most popular magazine for their Riv@@ age and channels like BB@@ C4 .
after using the BBC General Manager , Tony Hall , said the company wants to do more in partnership with other organizations , said that he attempts to get home six years in his time with Channel 4 without success , using the BBC in contact with the BBC .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that the BBC programs in order , or sends out one of the un@@ conventional rival , &quot; Johnson posed the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his study on the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I should not hold fast or longer , for a good idea , I should do his production at least , the other or on behalf of .
you will send the Voice in a first @-@ class window , since they would like to reach as many as possible support for the future .
the idea that anyone would have won this , is a jo@@ ke , it is ridi@@ cul@@ ous , it is of course non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ sive tax was funded , which could be financed without subsi@@ dies .
the Voice is a specific program , East@@ street is another , to submit both self @-@ productions .
honest , other channels would give their right arm to your right .
I need to see me how they should be public @-@ locked television .
I don &apos;t believe that this would l@@ essen the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who managed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC monitoring reports on the hunting ground for the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure the long @-@ term support .
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts programs , which , in which the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , was present in the Mac@@ mo@@ gart at the same day in 2003 , that the BBC shows how you &apos;d like to sell .
Johnson said that if they were not able to listen to the public German public eye , they argue that if they argue , if they argue , if they argue that for her apparent missions to the jus@@ tification of € 4 billion , &quot; Now , of course , we &apos;ve created all these programmes , which no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a window @-@ window in which no one ever wanted to see .
to broadcast the broadcast fee , Johnson EP says : &quot; I encourage you to find an more reg@@ ent system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from these .
of course , think that you think for £ 150 per year here is a great value , but for people who have a lot of money for the 150 £ an amount of money , if this is true , for they have not consume too much from the BBC .
the former sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also testi@@ fied before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC , to facilitate the C@@ CN@@ on Mission so that &quot; to hear and maintain it . &quot;
he said that only a bit of them was not classified as education , he said that there are 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in radio - and they should keep an example in the public internet television broad@@ casts in Australia and Canada . &quot;
regarding the need of partnerships , Eli@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only a handful of television will be shown on TV , and where commercial channels are possible to make everything online available .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; brain cells of sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ at@@ os@@ ks are going to the direction in the moment , in which they are cu@@ red using sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred saus@@ ages with gene@@ tically modified ad@@ ditions , that can be controlled by the sound @-@ waves of sound waves .

further to this issue : research and write cran@@ ial work with light
the researchers said the read@@ iness of a new procedure , called son@@ o@@ genetics , allows data to enable a series of brain , heart and muscle cells outside of the body .
Sre@@ m@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , has announced that the proceedings of a day could replace the depths of brain cancer , a inv@@ asi@@ al process that gives al @-@ impul@@ ses in the brain of people for treating Parkinson &apos;s disease .
fla@@ p @-@ stit@@ uting are not even more ultr@@ as@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani presented it that they were doing that when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scop@@ ic air bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , found out , intensi@@ fy the ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ waves that are then penet@@ rating into the wor@@ ms .
the increased ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ waves of a structures that can be found on the TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channel and found in the membran@@ es of some of the dice cells .
the sound wave works the findings of the I@@ on can@@ als with dis@@ able the cells that they are desc@@ to have a report in Nature .
by using ultr@@ as@@ ound Nem@@ at@@ us@@ den , Chal@@ as@@ ani gen@@ tically modified the stran@@ ds that some of its mot@@ oc@@ ur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion were attached .
if even pe@@ ed on the changing creatures , the sound wave is intensi@@ fied by the micro@@ b@@ lows and transferred to the saus@@ ages , where they can be able to change the modified motor team .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with the opto@@ genetics , a pioneering tool which enables scientists to modify the neur@@ ons of light with ease of light .
however , Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Gene@@ tics could have some advantages compared with this technology .
contrary to light , which in the dis@@ form of optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ high @-@ ultr@@ as@@ ound bio@@ stem cells are sin@@ king into the brain and can be sent to the brain on sk@@ ull .
&quot; we believe that with Gen@@ therapy and an therapeutic virus , the indicated human neur@@ ons is temporarily harm@@ less to clinical genetic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; says Chal@@ as@@ ani .

town@@ houses for refugees , multi @-@ parent , chest stra@@ ge@@ aring
the real estate company Markus Gil@@ dner relies on the Fran@@ con@@ ia City Council for people who have not yet have much money .
so , for refugees , - but also as signal : &quot; not only refugees need for home , but also the mother and the Ger@@ ling deser@@ ved life . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will show how you are still able to build and build today , &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
thousands of refugees are in the home market .
the entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believed to know how fast the room has been created , too : building is building a project of houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing onto the residential home .
what solution you do ?
Markus St@@ reng@@ th : the employees of transport@@ able accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms did not sustainability .
for people remain in a great part here .
given the refugee current , we need have sufficient living in the next few decades .
a completely ban@@ ent , three @-@ storey terraced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a row House takes you in the fe@@ west .
it has facilit@@ ated integration .
this is different , if people are under@@ taking people in housing blocks .
each of the six homes that are located in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for each one of four seek@@ ers .
each apartment unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees say , it is back again peace , I go back .
then , the houses can be converted to the respective needs .
how are the cost ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 ,000 euros without lots of land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasts six months .
this is reasonable .
have the rules to have they difficult ?
in addition , I had to avoid my project correctly .
especially difficult , it is still the dro@@ pl@@ and@@ ant D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the slot @-@ ordin@@ ance .

there will be still under@@ way , who building three apartments in one row , at least three pitches .
but only in the cities are missing .
and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how do the natives for their terraced house do not raise ?
in addition , Gil@@ dner - what was accused of having played a luxury center for asylum seek@@ ers .
everything definitely not right .
but tigh@@ tened apartments will not receive the new competition to be affordable apartments ?
Gil@@ dner : true - yet : we had over a construction boom in Germany over the last five years but with four basic apartments that can hardly be a lot of more .
my job has the message , even the normal people need living room .
not only refugees , but also the just @-@ tigh@@ tening mother or the Ger@@ ling deser@@ ved .
I show how to get quite cheap and build today .
that is why it comes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS system , if Apple App will be released
the new operating system can be requested by implementing the setting @-@ app , which displays &quot; General , &quot; then &quot; software update . &quot;
if it is ready to download the phone the option to Download and then install it .
some are soon after you got out , as it will get an error message , the release that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to avoid this problem , users may have recommended to wait either to wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght or try to upgrade to any iTunes .
the telephone even leads you through the rest of the process .
it might mean the sol@@ der of Apps to create place - but Apple has easier to do with the disappearance of updates . if you prefer to create a special tool , then delete them and install it then , as soon as the process is complete .
it &apos;s worth it to ensure that your mobile phone is charged while updating is loaded or close to a load , so that the battery is charged .
if the charge is too low , Apple &apos;s not able to release the update , as the phone may change on hal@@ ed way , and may result in a demo@@ li@@ tion of the updates .

next to the consult@@ ations , the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ berg provides prevention , health care and wellness .
Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken off with the boat .
hence you can use additional offers such as Stur@@ z@@ pre@@ sto , memory training or a physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offer of the senior centres and the Sal@@ u@@ dis supplement is in the ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and re@@ hab .

it was sympath@@ y on the first sight , when she met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll that currently aims at present their vocational training in the Ver@@ ge hospital and acquired the year in practice .
&quot; we always had in the back head that the mu@@ er@@ ce would fit quite in these practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel rock sens@@ ory and laugh@@ s .
&quot; when so far , I was called to called . &quot;
the idea was right in the idea to run his own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and continuous contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we would like to know the families of the years , and accompany the families .
as a advantage , he also see his own boss .
and so one can agree that the com@@ eth bought the house with the practice .
and is still to be living in Op@@ ge@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ liers .

during the sur@@ geon Dr@@ Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ici@@ ausen worked as a doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional Trainer of Intern@@ acional ) specializes in the Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mu@@ er@@ ce , both of which were up , had to be taken off as a home country .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the renovation , the rooms are modern .
we are able to offer more ultr@@ asonic examination and long @-@ term cleaning and un@@ used intercom .
the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the fuel of the mill in the framework of a grant from the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the congregation ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the community ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that shows how proud and joy@@ ful we are going to continue the practice , &quot; emphas@@ ises Sam@@ t@@ a Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 2000 patients , according to the Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll every quarter in the practice of Fel@@ del@@ ausen , during the North German average language , however , is about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there are still another house practices .
a positive di@@ sol@@ ation of practice @-@ taking by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains to the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ici@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if not a successor , it would have gone , too .
those who &apos;s going to be visited exemp@@ li@@ antly , by the way , especially in confi@@ dential faces : today , the seven medical specialists manufactured by the field of col@@ oration .
with this end , he ends in As@@ endorf and said , at least the medical plans had been prac@@ tised for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by the beginning , we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel rock sh@@ ausen sh@@ ady , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long season , they really rested after the long time .
&quot; but we live in the high bo@@ g . &quot; many patients have still seen many patients , &quot; he says the Intern@@ acional Trainer .
her husband comple@@ ments l@@ ach@@ end : &quot; we have a 6000 square meters plot of land . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have still pushed me out of garden tools , now it could be different . &quot;
also , the couple got two grand@@ son and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we can let the refugees away ! &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also shot on our South border , &quot; says Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
in contrast , the controls reminded of the Hungarian border , remain at the same time .
it is clear that anyone who wants to provide a demand for political asylum , this also might be possible . &quot;
the supply and safety of human people were up in the fore@@ ground .
it is clear , however , &quot; that it takes significant signals , &quot; said the Council of Ministers &quot; said .
the people have to recognize that we are not accept some mi@@ stru@@ sive migration flows - even over the Austro @-@ Slovenian fron@@ tier .
we need a controlled approach .
Croatia enters &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia .
the Croatian government had informed these rights , including Slovenia , for the coming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and some circumstances can also er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
so far this doesn &apos;t see the Minister Ves@@ na Györ@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Ljubljana , however .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors may be &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia , rather than the monitoring of the border - primarily on Hungary - stronger .
with Croatia , the border with Croatia is already the external limit of the Schengen area .
as the Council of Ministers , Slovenian has said to speak its boundaries for refugees but not to be destroyed .
&quot; each of the EU member has to fill his obligations , otherwise the system can &apos;t work , &quot; said Györ@@ gy Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government announced that the first refugees had to pass in the night hours to Tuesday , in eastern Croatian , at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ de , to avoid the Registration .
the Croatian police was able to attack them in the near @-@ areas of corn .
according to the local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik concludes an independent police vehicles with new refugees .
they would appear in for Syri@@ ans , Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
even ambul@@ ance services and the Red Cross are already used .
in the coming days of hosting a country with around 4,000 refugees , from the Minister of Home Rank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
the buses was also said to have brought together from Pre@@ se@@ vo , on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian government , who previously managed to get to the Hungarian border , including Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media at Wednesday .
the Belgrade government turns out , however , that they are going to enter into certain number of routes : &quot; neither cannot we ask that , nor let us do this , &quot; his name was .
according to media reports , a first bus to meet with around 50 refugees meet in the de@@ city of Si@@ d , in the course of the day would be expected for further buses .
over Croatia , Slovenia and Austria in Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the roads as a whole night by the some 500 kilometres distant from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has taken of it , so we told us the police under@@ go it , &quot; said one of the refugees .
they wanted to travel by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria further to Germany .
so , it could actually be in fact to come from observer to the previous Balkan @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary to a little further west .
Croatia : &quot; complete possibilities for border control &quot;
to Croatia &apos;s interior , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said that his country had been prepared for the case of a strong conflict in refugees to protect the plans for potential applications .
details mentioned he did not , he pointed out that , as non @-@ Schengen Area , &apos; complete possibilities to cross the border . &quot;
one insp@@ ire insp@@ ections to qualify for the membership of the file location .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partner since the country has consistently been consistently a good testimony regarding the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side about some 300 refugees below the Hungarian border .
according to the media report , they had spent the past night in the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border payments , Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remains perfectly closed .
whether the remaining refugees are going to start with the Croatian border , it is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister of Minister Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic were bound to calm his / day in the village of Hor@@ gos ; it serves the debates about the alternative route of refugees , after the Hungarian border is closed ;
it would not currently fail to negotiate a very high number of refugees .
it could not be said if they would continue their journey to Hungary , Croatia or another country .
supporters on @-@ dangerous aid @-@ like @-@ dangerous characters
however , private number of refugee workers have already started to spread the refugees to social , in which alternative routes are dra@@ fted through Croatia .
however , the border crossing into Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area there is also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war and still not granted mine fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .

Fed@@ ex @-@ income mixed , financial outlook for 2016
Fed@@ ex , a dis@@ appoint@@ ing results for the last quarter , and the late @-@ re@@ efer video showed his profit out over a whole year due to we@@ aker demand to shipping services and higher costs in their Bod@@ gan@@ ce services .
the company also said that they plans to stand about 5@@ 5.000 workers during their vacation .
this time in the last year , Fed@@ ex announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the summer season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent within the market market 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday .
Fed@@ ex Corp. An@@ no@@ un@@ ces a profit of $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10.00 in the financial year to earn 20 cent less than with the previous forecast .
according to a survey by Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the smaller views is based despite the price increases , which should be an average of 4.9 percent and on January 4 , and despite a higher attack in Bod@@ gan@@ ä@@ s provided by heavy and large packages , which will be recorded from November .
the company said that it is likely to expect to increase the result from cost reduction , higher income , and due to growth in online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred und stated that the company &quot; solid sales have now materi@@ alised if added to we@@ aker the economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and with truly global trade . &quot;
the plans for the summer study were announced a day later than the rival U@@ PS , which plans to put 90@@ ,000 additional labour force in 9@@ 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour force for the same number as last year .
in the quarter of 2009 , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ ex mobile 6@@ 92 million , ended 6 percent more than in the previous year .
the earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 US $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research and Analy@@ st was asked .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks backed analysts anticipated 12,@@ 23 billion $ .
in recent years , Fed@@ ex decided to place a decline in international anti @-@ shipping order to stagn@@ ating sales in his unit Express documents .
but the boom in the online shopping , however , has increased the results for the F@@ ed .
in the last quarter , sales were provided by achieved by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically required due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ rein@@ surance .
the Express unit posted higher income due to higher prices , while the result decreased by higher working costs in cargo business .
in the market of Pre@@ market , for about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed ex shares would be 3.@@ 85 billion , or 2.5 percent , from 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they closed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent in a record high on June 11 .
on the most anticipated conference last week , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend a 27 minute tour of Honduras &quot; Mah@@ ag@@ oni desk , to decide whether it is time for almost a decade left to the Leit@@ z &apos;s first weekend .
dro@@ pping about them on the end of the for@@ given , two @-@ storey seats , is the m@@ ural of the United States .
the map is a Memory of that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ella , and her colleagues is to set the economic interests of the nation over all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold order from the congress : maxim@@ ise the US employment and prices here .
but since the Great recession , the F@@ ed leader have recognised the fact that it is an unmistak@@ able client from the financial stability : financial stability .
and this third Mand@@ ate could be well @-@ factor in a decision to predi@@ ct it to predi@@ ct it . on Thursday there will be an unprecedented level of interest , an unprecedented level of interest rate from the close to zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although , most of the economy are growing that it grows on solid , the most recent tur@@ mo@@ il - in the global financial markets to imp@@ ose these vol@@ atility in the global financial markets . this vol@@ atility means to intensi@@ fy the interest of the loans . that is , too , only by one quarter percentage point .
apparent to the Labour market and inflation can be considered to be the most important thing of what they are observed , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , editor in management of the making company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
but I think when searching on a pre@@ text , the interest rate is not increased , the increased un@@ certainty around the global market was enough to wait for the global market , &quot; she said .
there is no con@@ sensus about what the F@@ ed will do what is sec@@ ures up itself in the financial market .
approximately half of the econ@@ omist , who were recently asked about Bloomberg , have raised a interest margin this week .
the financial markets are expecting to wait an end of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , who only shows a 30 % chance onto an increase .
this indicates a decline in securities market if the F@@ ed increases the rate , it &apos;s clear to the strategy of changing , by promise to promise that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones &quot; average value of 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or dropped by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed @-@ politics gathered moment@@ um in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econ@@ omist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would withdraw the sets at this point , &quot; he said .
if it does doing , &quot; He would have to go in her statement to calm the financial markets , so that it was not running in panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a vermi@@ lion would good to cal@@ ming the financial markets , because they would allow the un@@ certainty how the F@@ ed would be prepared .
still before a month , the F@@ ed would start by 0.@@ 25 percentage points to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points to this month , the first small step in a slow disappearance of the mon@@ et@@ ate conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States .
in the spring and early summer , I said that in spite of the condition that some economic consequences were needed , they needed an increase in the terms of the company .
although the job creation had been slow@@ down in August , it was solid at the labour market in this year .
unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and , in the proximity of the level , which the F@@ ed as full @-@ employment .
Lohn@@ increases will have shown signs of recovery .
and though inflation was steadily under the target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives announced that the primary open source has remained lower than lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can handle new interest rates and do not need it at the lifting voltage on the job market , &quot; published Ian Sh@@ ep@@ hal@@ dson , Chief econ@@ omist at Pan@@ the@@ on .
but the financial markets went together all over the world down at the end of the month , after China had cancelled its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Core Bank value , which was more than 16 % in May by more than 16 % , when investors su@@ cked to prevent that a slow@@ down of China &apos;s economy would grow the global growth of ch@@ okes .
the market has recovered slightly in this month , with the inde@@ er of the inde@@ er lasted almost 10 % below the May 2014 level .
for the F@@ ed @-@ representatives influence the market turbul@@ ent will influence the complex times that should be given to the interest .
&quot; if the events in the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy would not have been included in this meeting , &quot; said Mr D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fellow at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. Emergency database .
now he says , that she will continue to wait for at least one month , to get the impact better in the handle .
there is a number of un@@ certainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable sources of describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the global economy is not the chief of the F@@ ed , so they should not be excluded at any decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authorities in the world has become the end .
the influence of the central bank@@ ers was enorm@@ ously high in the past years .
the mere hint of the letter Ben S. Bern@@ anke , in 2013 , that the F@@ ed will receive its mon@@ ary expansion &quot; in particular , a man@@ ner@@ ed man@@ ned around the globe .
in one of the economies , in which markets and economies of the economies of each other , the F@@ ed to representatives will need not only monitor the developments in other departments , but also advis@@ ing other central banks and experts will get a better understanding for the global economy .
her decision @-@ making reference is &quot; more art as science , &quot; said Z@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the global Strategy for asset management of the company En@@ cru@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey Fel@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted that &quot; F@@ ed a story of actions on financial market movements , seem to be associated with the economic situation of discovery data . &quot;
lack@@ er , voting on the Federal Open Market Committee , which stri@@ ves for a interest margin , will be deployed in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to increase their guidance by 0.@@ 75 percentage points to three sessions , &quot; despite a lim@@ it@@ ably damaged effects on growth in the US &quot; .
one year later , the F@@ ed @-@ representative of these cuts also took on .
the F@@ ed , aspects of the financial stability and , is set to the first place in 2008 , as Adam S. Poznan , former member of the National Committee of the Bank of England &apos;s interest in the Bank of England .
the most recent tur@@ mo@@ il do not come into the vicinity of this plane , he said .
&quot; you don &apos;t want to catch the situation , in which they saw fear of a vermi@@ lion , because the markets has its exciting , &quot; said Posen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not refer to the Financial St@@ ability , and by the way that it is not , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s ahead of time .

Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric cardi@@ al company Rio Grande promotes food for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS will try to clari@@ fy how important good diet during the de@@ commissioning period . it is done with the presentation of images of babies , which are painted with represent@@ ations of healthy foods .
breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , who provide for babies all the nutrients needed to establish a strong immune system .
thanks to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers keep getting pregnant and young mothers , increased their daily calories can increase by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ gestive system adap@@ tion to recover mothers .
a recent study under the management of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet was declining because the gene from their babies and protects people against the development of tumours .
unfortunately , a healthy diet of the child can affect an immune system negative .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Gym
the municipality of Bern@@ hardt also approved the contract for the 2.3 million euros in sports hall .
and he was an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter at solar system .
the plans for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ table at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Forum will step forward step by step : in the recent meeting session , the building completed without great discussions .
earlier , the panel of directors decided in favour of a request to a legal &quot; resp@@ ects &quot; charged &quot; of the valid construction work .
in the &quot; exception , &quot; the application used to make the entry for a special form regarding the roof structure .
in the case , a &quot; saddle @-@ roof was &quot; built with non @-@ co @-@ employed first and roof console . &quot;
background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar equipment : &quot; by this we get a wonderful huge roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger , sitting at the meeting .
in the &quot; liberation &quot; movement in turn was prescribed for energy reasons beyond the construction work , rather than in the construction work , under 10 degrees .
the volume of the hall will be reduced significantly .
in no way , a &quot; liberation &quot; was necessary due to the construction plan for no &quot; exceptions . &quot; this allows the evidence to restri@@ ct the council in general rule by terms of general orders .
however , in the turn@@ out year , this is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we don &apos;t create a preced@@ ence for such as St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the turn@@ h@@ amm@@ bau at the Centre has a joint project of the community and the SV Bern@@ ried .

he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer her colleagues , to assume the post of the medical director .

previous refugees need accommodations : study warns against This vac@@ ancy
the location on the German housing market is reproduced .
more refugees are looking for a paid generation .
printing on the housing market is growing .
the social rental project is standing before a challenge .
the cum@@ ulative competitions on the German housing market has long began .
with the coming refugees and working copy from the EU , more people pushing on a market that is already over@@ hung in many big cities .
you compete with a ann@@ ular citizens having the final taste of the apartments .
to cover the demand for affordable homes , we would have to built this year 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 .
this result was a study on the behalf of the Committee of soci@@ ology , &quot; social rental of residential buildings . &quot;
by comparison : in Germany , 260@@ ,000 units are finished .
so there are 14@@ 0.000 apartments .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are not obliged to live in an asylum seek@@ er in 2013 .
many encounter each of the housing market and had been in the long sn@@ akes in front of the apartments .
according to the Statisti@@ cal federal population last year , less than half of all asylum applic@@ ants were available .
the negative development of the housing market is however just not just outside the rising refugee camps .
the study also makes significant changes in the residential construction of the last years .
Germany reminds of a new vac@@ ation@@ ers in front of her , which is bigger by the year ago .
currently , about 77@@ ,000 residential units are already missing in the urban areas , compl@@ ains : Matthias Günther , author of the study .
a lot of professional fil@@ ings lived in large cities of ne@@ ov@@ ings in the cities of WG one .
young Ad@@ ults remained for no longer in the &quot; Hotel MO@@ M &quot; because of the fin@@ nish on the residential home .
in the big cities the number of square metres per capita has fallen back again for the first time .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; social rental structure &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
in doing this , new attack had to stimul@@ ate the social home structure .
as a result , the Gr@@ under@@ wer@@ - Tax is not necessary and the primary tax for subsi@@ dised flats are under@@ lies .
furthermore , according to the Alliance , an attractive tax @-@ possibility is necessary .
this promotion programme for refugee accommodation from the state Bank of vehicle service has already been good in cities and municipalities already .
some good week after the start was scheduled on Monday evening with 184 million euros , more than half those made available for around $ 300 million .
now the project could even be extended .
refugees had free money : Croatia and Slovenia is corridor .
in Hungary , virtually collapsed , there is virtually no longer entering into Croatia , there are still more refugees to go through Croatia .
Zagreb announces that there were a journey of Slovenia in the North without not@@ ches .
this is dangerous to the route yet .
Croatia wants to do this with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with Slovenian Secretary of Minister , and when it is necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Home Minister , Rank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not a Schengen country .
after the turn of the Serbian and Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees to Croatia are broken down to get there from Western Europe to Western Europe .
500 people are coming near the border of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV channel RTL .
the day on the day he had sealed his border for refugees .
new laws , born on the same day in force , will also close out asylum seek@@ ers in Hungary .
Croatia will happen to pass the refugees in Croatia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister , Zoran Mil@@ an@@ ovic explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can go through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we prepare for this one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are , many women , children and men who live and just want to achieve .
there is people , however , that would not live in Croatia .
the Croatian police abandoned the first refugees to the border of Serbia in the morning , from the border of Serbia .
most tr@@ un@@ ites were to meet most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
you came with both bus and taxi in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
directly after her arrival , they tried to get to the green border with Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , he is not represented in Gren@@ ada .
that is the limit of the passage @-@ stri@@ pe : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v &apos;s civil war in the 90 &apos;s .
min@@ e@@ fields it should now create a safe passage .
in Hungary the border of the border are barely any longer .
on Tuesday , the police reached 3@@ 66 access .
shortly before Tor@@ ry on Monday , it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws about taking action and damage the gren@@ ade through a stra@@ at .
in the south @-@ Hungarian border town Sz@@ eged , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
the tra@@ ffi@@ cking are sentences up to five years and the deportation in the country .
according to the immigration incident , one held Tuesday for the new &quot; transit zones , &quot; a total of 94 Asy@@ lan@@ ders , almost all of them - 93 - of the main transition R@@ ös@@ sing .
among the applicant are 13 families with small children , as well as two older people .
in the evening , there will be 40 refugees .
in practice , no one has a view , to be granted asylum in Hungary .
after the Hungarian view , Serbia inv@@ ade a &quot; safe @-@ party land . &quot;
the previous asylum applic@@ ants are to be delivered to .
front of the &quot; Tran@@ sit@@ u &quot; zone in R@@ ös@@ go , countless , just a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke we began to clear up .
it sh@@ ook the tr@@ ash one , the tens of thousands of people in the past three weeks left in the road@@ side .
bro@@ gri@@ lle was min@@ ed and the production field in the cross @-@ border were re@@ model@@ ed .
for this purpose , no one wanted to have the goal of this upgrade .
Austria reached only a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also has its border controls .
around 20,000 migrants , only in country , was still in the country .
in Salzburg , around 1400 people wait for the continuation to Germany .
the train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the German authorities in the morning .
in Freil@@ assing , smaller groups of refugees meet on a regular basis .
mayor &quot; Gest@@ ran@@ den &quot; on the border
&quot; we were at the bridge party on Sunday with the border , when I suddenly got ten people with travel @-@ off@@ ences at the entrance of the celebration , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they want to train with the train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany came to participate in the refugee &apos;s traffic between Austria and Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , that Stad@@ ler , who offered its help and spread the spread together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars along the border of the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
previously , we used the un@@ pron@@ ged guest once again , with sounds and beverages .
we have said good , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; it was of course for us , &quot; as a Stad@@ ler for the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
she was very thank@@ ful .
a man didn &apos;t take up any big donation to the fee - 100 Euro for the fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; has very pleased with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cruise passengers stuck at the Sunday evening in Wels , Austria , in the course of Pass@@ au train , to change the ann@@ unci@@ ation of the ann@@ unci@@ ation was cancelled after the short term , but to try more about the limit .
the map was closed down before the border of W@@ ern@@ stein front of Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing was generally highly regarded in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ berg Group with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday are going to reach a two @-@ br@@ oth @-@ walk , organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now sending further Z@@ ig@@ by to us , is a logical result of a apparent case :
instead of the R@@ ös@@ sing camp on the construction of building structures , the State &apos;s Office has already been officially decorated to the position of the Hungarian government in the hands of the Hungarian government in the way of the Hungarian government .
Lei@@ f @-@ carrying of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are confron@@ ts with chao@@ tic circumstances in the border range .
they are also known to lie the gu@@ ise of the Holy Land , that the &quot; praise of the land &quot; that she had invited us and welcome nothing to a refugee camp .
there will be a big challenge because of continuing treatment passes and ending winter , some decent conditions for acoustic conditions .
and it will be a great number of great , peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad , on the search of 3@@ 5.000 winter tours
Konrad , with the refugee adop@@ ting all hands to do .
Christian Konrad is it according to his word &apos; weight .
the government has used the former Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank , to represent Qu@@ arti@@ ves for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first @-@ up center of the country , Konrad already picked up the handle .
&quot; We don &apos;t have homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he told his first success .
there is also the accomodation of 20,000 refugees that came to Austria on Monday after the end of 2015 , Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; Master capacity . &quot;
by the Ministry of Interior , however , the Interior said . &quot;
all in all , Konrad , with a demand of 85@@ ,000 qu@@ arti@@ s on the sh@@ ur@@ iger years .
to meet the number , in the next weeks , you have to be 3@@ 5,000 accommodations in the next weeks - 20,000 is expected to provide the countries , 15,000 members .
should there be more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; but it is no tor@@ ass without the ground , &quot; said Konrad .
with the state army he has led talks .
these could have backed it up , even for the coming refugees Qu@@ arti@@ ter .
in Upper Austria , &quot; right &quot; to the Upper Austria , Ferry Mai@@ er said .
however , the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atory is fully supported across the long season .
morning , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , intended to be clari@@ fied like the Church will help .
a great expectations of the asylum range also puts large expectations to the ORF @-@ action &quot; Hel@@ ping like we . &quot;
the private and un@@ complicated accommodation can be available on the platform .
there is also hopes to be empty in the winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in case of emergency times , it could not be possible that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ gen must have some height of the towel or the size of the ex@@ ert@@ ure .
for a short @-@ term time , &quot; Emergency money &quot; need to apply . &quot;
unlike the Ministry of Interior , he is explained in the Interior after the Interior , &quot; reveals Konrad with his experience .
I &apos;m an older Lord , where you don &apos;t forget to say , no more face to the face of truth .
over@@ generation capacity is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er desc@@ ends the republic , how they might have declared .
their number of employees don &apos;t want to increase it to three to four .
the own Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ Manager has yet been yet successful .
Konrad celebrated a container on St Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
however there is apparently problems with permission .
Linz ur@@ ges a better search
never an opening of urban sporting music and other buildings such as Tips - Arena and Design Center to arrange the refugees plans to mark the city of Linz .
this is currently not necessary , as the people could currently under@@ cover these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
in case of emergency , further sites are expected to be tested for its ability .
criticism of the city manager , as demanded for the refugees within the country .
other departments must make their contribution here .
se@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed . &quot;
in a longer rec@@ ital with the Bavarian Prime Minister of Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , the main army Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has qu@@ ire further action in the refugee camp by Monday .
a.@@ s.@@ He has as@@ sures me that the German borders have not sealed off .
the passing of refugees to the Federal Republic should continue to be possible .
however , we already give the appropriate boundary conditions .
completely , too , special trains with refugees to Germany will never give any more .
the protection provided would be brought to Germany with regular breeding .
at the other EU Member States , P@@ uri@@ inger demanded more intense solidarity in the refugee camp .
that Austria will continue to move in its limits as well , is a logical consequence , &quot; a logical consequence , &quot; of the approach of the Germans .
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of the time
the general refur@@ bis@@ ment of the &quot; New Werft &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industry has been officially completed .
in four of the six store@@ ys of office and production building , the companies listed in the stock market is S &amp; T , the remainder ( 2700 square metres ) , on young , innovative companies in the technology sector .
&quot; in IT the wise b@@ ills are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T , leader Hannes Hol@@ haus@@ er .
he could introduce to invest in the startup @-@ companies of the new shi@@ pyard and will also be out@@ fitting the company .
even from the beginning , S &amp; T will cooperate with the new neighbours - one of those who are still inhabited : &quot; the next leg Ru@@ unt@@ astic was only a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million Euros have been invested in the production facility , which is 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , Austria &apos;s Upper Austria and the Con@@ federation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is designed from Linz AG for 60 years on S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
a 30 % of the live surface of the building are already le@@ ased ; for further 40 percent already it will be in@@ quiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ for@@ erin opened the second business in the ar@@ cade
there will be the attention to Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags on the new shop .
actually , J@@ utta Bre@@ ite gave a dog .
this project has had to shift the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ en@@ markt note : finally , she is now able to take shape in the form of a further business top@@ ical .
in the Fur@@ la shop , across the business , in which they sell bags , suitcase , shoes and masses of various manufacturers , these are now shooting at the Fur@@ la , hand@@ bags &amp; the stock exchange as from 75 Euro .
larger bags and accessories are cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously , several weeks re@@ model@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long been going to open this right &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Bre@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive here for this decision was , among other things , that were also the Fur@@ la producer , who are also home in Bologna , from the idea of a location , to which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only one in the big room of Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has herself with Italian roots .
her fashion interest has gotten off @-@ wide from her mother into the cra@@ dle of her mother .
I exchanged most , when something develops and I can see new trends in current prices .
why , for some people at the sight of a beautiful pur@@ se in the return of this , too , the specialist woman can not get to last a last security .
perhaps it is true that a beautiful bag is getting any outdoors .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Stor@@ k @-@ owned ancestors of Donald &apos;s plat@@ former came from a place whose inhabitants can be named .
this feature is also soft to the billi@@ on@@ aire , which wants to become US president .
Donald &apos;s dump ( 69 ) is still well suited for shooting .
whether he commented on foreign currencies , journalists through the en@@ rich and knowledge g@@ aps in the international crisis policy - the applic@@ ants for the US presidency will don@@ key the election campaign .
and cut off right .
this is also registered in the German town of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the large amounts of acquiring real estate in the US .
the New York leader with the Belgian @-@ term village is one of many in the wine bar village on the wine route .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant town is over -@@ zig , which is related to him .
his grandfather made in K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald &apos;s plat@@ forming , here in the election campaign .
the resp@@ session of Simone Wen@@ del and the film was shot by a film .
what do the vill@@ agers of the world are to be the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that &quot; very exciting , &quot; but they are very exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has made an am@@ using documentary about the village and his famous water@@ tone , which also has a dump of the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
tr@@ ump , who is not known for labelling comes , comes to word &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , and with the testimony that he would be sure if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
to the king of the heart he did not exist there .
although it may be possible with respect to the performance of the family , but also ten@@ den@@ ced the opinion that plat@@ es@@ ame was a bit a huge happ@@ ily , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
the top name of the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ y@@ ol@@ macher , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher , &quot; - too high in German : the interview , she says .
tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ sel@@ ector .
the story of the success started in 1885 , when the future grandfather bred , living in the USA a locomotive for a gold dig@@ ging .
the foundation of the real estate group in New York were the foundation of the real estate group .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : her desire to return to the home country at the Bavarian State , which was then owned at the time .
he didn &apos;t have plat@@ es@@ ame , because he was once worn without permission , the director of the Institute for Do@@ pe@@ z@@ anic History and Ethno@@ graphy , Roland Paul , was declared a film start .
tr@@ ump was the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emi@@ grant . &quot;
this is contrast to the b@@ unk@@ y testimony of the follow @-@ up .
the company had repeatedly den@@ ounced p@@ anc@@ ep@@ ed in the United States and called the construction of a border wall to remove illegal immigration .
so much like that , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote village called Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was born , was born , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , who was born in Op@@ a , was born by Heinz ) .
the Win@@ zer on retired is still more di@@ stan@@ sted , &quot; he is always so high @-@ end . &quot;
believes him that tr@@ ump comes round ?
&quot; I can not imagine myself , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
he has never take care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension system Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentions , as man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stadt , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz felt a visit to a visit to the church , which is widely varied in the future .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that &quot; Donald do not imagine , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you are better if he didn &apos;t want the choice , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the radical opinions , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if anyone who had left the S@@ agen for the time of his grandfather in the USA , they would have been possible , &quot; he would have never been having arrived . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are interesting topics as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ et@@ cher Sarah Bü@@ hler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is it not , &quot; he says .
and : &quot; the grapes are also shot without the President . &quot;
Wen@@ del &apos;s film , inter@@ viewed for the tr@@ ump @-@ long , has seen 12 000 young dri@@ fts - also raised in the USA .
the Upper Bavarian Municipality in Ram@@ sau with Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain@@ eering village . &quot;
from the hand of Vice President of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher @-@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ residents minority in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park will deliver the distinction for rolling tourism .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain slopes . &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the dor@@ pf Club is responsible for the transfer of the award .
a &quot; mountain@@ eering village &quot; must have at most of the 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of his surface must be extra@@ d@@ ited as protected area .
Seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise will domin@@ ates the ratings , despite the trials of Nine , to assume their loss of leadership in the Today show .
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son came to Can@@ ber@@ ra in order to report the loss of the leaders of the Liber@@ als , but there has no big report on board for USA Today .
the breakfast show of Nine was rela@@ yed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m moved to the overthrow of Tony down .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers of David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ mas , put into London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls , and Cancun .
this draw@@ back to Australian TV viewers could not play an issue , as Sun@@ rise was an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities , according to Today 33@@ 9,000 .
Today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ ,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
in the last months , Today , a long @-@ gap to the Sun@@ rise was closed .
in August , Germany reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the gap passed between 40,000 and 50.000 .
this September , Sun@@ rise was on an average of 34@@ 9,000 spectators to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at USA .
this is the most interesting , what happens every morning .
the conversion of the change will affect the early morning more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are okay , thank you for the review !

for easy @-@ to @-@ scale diabe@@ tics can be helpful if loss of loss .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for light overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last up to a new study at least five years .
it is yet to be too early to tell whether light overweight people with diabetes regarding weight loss and life , than those who received non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality study require a long time to show anything , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss @-@ surgery , which had a key article on the new study in J@@ AMA Sur@@ gery .
weight loss ( or bari@@ atric surgery ) , use different methods to minimi@@ ze the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limits the body &apos;s own ability to welcome food .
the years obesity has been proved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes worldwide , but most studies have been performed in people who have disease , obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a common level of weight in relation to size , is generally considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more will be shown that someone is overweight is obes@@ e and people with a BMI above 30 are considered low @-@ obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BMI between 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital who have been collected in a study and compare two types of obesity - surgery , ground@@ sheet and stomach ul@@ um - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were very overweight .
average BMI below those who are under@@ go this operation , decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
however , the BMI between the person who did not receive 2 @-@ surgical diabetes was approximately equal to 29 .
under the move , who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was totally stressed by 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , the Diabetes group was completely b@@ alled by only one percent , and in some cases it was only about two percent .
in addition , the results were measured in controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol . &quot; in general , the authors found better in the &apos; surgical @-@ group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also out@@ lay the patients ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c levels that reflect the blood sugar level in the course of the time .
H@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c are held by the best under 7 percent , write the researchers .
according to the surgery , the average Hä@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level declined by around 9 per cent to about 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ce@@ mic control &quot; - like you reflect with improved h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - lowered the risk of mortality in five years so by the leading researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su , and his colleagues .
the research team significantly cuts average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ ypass tube surgery was lost ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , greater variation in BMI ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded rather than complete control of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study has no demonstrated survival benefit in surgery after five years , there are indications from one study he@@ avier people in Sweden that , in operation , Black@@ stone is coming from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in a Swedish study , about 29 percent less throughout the Swedish study was to under@@ go a adi@@ posit@@ as @-@ surgery , some 29 percent failed to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that conventional methods .
although the new study is no advantage for survival in surgery in surgery , Black@@ stone , it was good for people who have a BMI of 35 , who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , as it says that , in this low BMI of BMI , &quot; is low , that this operation is higher in the low BMI of water , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors will begin to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient is with its BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think that we have to wait for long time , till we want to do it seriously , &quot; she said .
I think that as soon as these genetic changes have accumulated , they have accumulated your body with obesity and diabetes , is a tough to return . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible to happen that anyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not under@@ go all the refugees , Dalai Lama and added the true solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders called on to end the violence in the countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama , the problem of the prolon@@ ged refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ are in Oxford in 1993 .
he called for that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity must be displayed off the interests of individual nations or even the continent .
he also emphasized that the response of the West European countries caused the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible to happen that anyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
though the Dalai Lama visited Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts at the tac@@ kl@@ ing of the crisis , he stressed that there was only a temporary solution .
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , a wonderful but in the meantime , you must think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and real development , which can be created mainly by education to these Muslim countries .
finally , we must remember to think that the killing in their countries is reduced .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama , the problem of violence , and commented on the George B@@ ush@@ s action after the terrorist attack in September 11 , and out that the forci@@ ble reaction of the United States moved to an chain of un@@ regulated events .
after September 11 , I put my b@@ ump in a letter to President Bush ; and I told him , the way to the solution to this problem is in non @-@ violence .
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put the authority , and that has added in@@ unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
four @-@ time increase of intake of ham@@ mo@@ des@@ how by children in the last 4 years
Gi@@ ft@@ fixed age centers in the United States have also reporting an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , that the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of the Georgia Po@@ ison center , then reported cases by revenue of hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants among children under 12 years , while Gi@@ ving control centres , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; kids are always more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in not@@ ation , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN .
he said that some children of disinf@@ ect@@ ant is clearly given , while some things do to im@@ press their friends , or to speak for a rehear@@ sal about the social media .
videos on YouTube show , like te@@ ens disinf@@ ect@@ ant only drink because of a cheap measurement .
youth have allegedly obtained disinf@@ ect@@ ant with non @-@ alcoholic soft water , in order to obtain a harder drink .
more recently children can be drawn from attractive no@@ bility of the disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; one child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; says Lop@@ ez .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who need .
there is disinf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berries , grapes , and orange stones , who are very promising for children .
ham@@ mo@@ des@@ how disinf@@ ect@@ ant somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol .
particularly with small children , too short spl@@ ashes can lead po@@ is@@ oning to alcohol po@@ is@@ oning .
it &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ emergency centre in the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City .
so , you would not have ch@@ amps to stand up with but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and if children come from it , then it &apos;s a quick opportunity to consume extra alcohol .
N@@ hai@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had produced four sy@@ ring@@ es out of straw@@ berry and ham@@ mer@@ its medicine in school was brought into a not@@ ation of treatment .
her blood @-@ alcohol was 179 , twice higher than the threshold of breast cancer , which holds the potential for an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ che@@ y , a not@@ ation physician who treated her at the G@@ win@@ nice Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ hai@@ jah l@@ wor@@ ded her words and did not return to the situation when they arrived in a not@@ ation .
doctors over@@ looked them over night in a separate children &apos;s disease in the signs of mil@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen by the alcohol , said Rit@@ che@@ y .
&quot; this was very wor@@ rying , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ hai@@ u &apos;s mother , CNN .
it would have been mort@@ ally wounded for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers recommended to use soft @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ant disinf@@ ection and disinf@@ ect@@ ant units outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol po@@ is@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ant were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario Canada accounted for a toxic , non @-@ toxic , non @-@ toxic imp@@ aired , which was toxic .

people here are not just about the return of the leader@@ board .
you speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams , and that is what they &apos;re interested .
there is a lot of voltage at the Old Fir@@ m game , and there are not only ones in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn the things around , swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .
Ron@@ ny D@@ eil@@ a accepted that Cel@@ tic must fight , but the nor@@ we@@ gian boss decided to turn things .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the following exit from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who now ended with a gap of five points , clearly at the top of the table .
D@@ eil@@ a said : &quot; Cel@@ tic had already bad times , and we will come back again . &quot;
now we would like to come quickly as soon as possible .
I know , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very w@@ rou@@ d or sad about what happens .
we feel that exactly as - but we must continue further .
we really really want to get the support of Cel@@ tic , because that &apos;s better makes the player better .
now she is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton is handled at January @-@ Trans@@ fers
despite the comments on a few weeks ago , that he was reported that he wants to take a few of January @-@ transfer payments , is the rank @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton , with the signing of Neu@@ fel@@ lows and is guaranteed to be dis@@ rup@@ ted by the unit of the I@@ bro@@ x Ka@@ ders .
the ex @-@ chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford told : &quot; January transfer window is very different from Summer window . &quot;
players who come in the summer , have this pre@@ season time to integrate , what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is arranged by adding un@@ unnecessary players , which you really need .

why is the witness of an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
some later still , except with a late legal inter@@ vening , I would likely look like a man to death .
if it happens , and I hope it will not understand that I will be lying in an audience at the &apos;s chamber in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary because Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed through the le@@ thal injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death in his death .
the invitation was for the first time in January of his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I voted in favor .
when the day was getting closer , I started to fear me .
so why should I do it ?
I voted in favor , because I thought it was a great way to tell the entire story about death penalty .
it would be a unique perspective .
it &apos;s true that journalists will also take place in the USA , as often as more ants were available as seats at the USA , there will be a ma@@ ins lot@@ tery place to decide who was elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
if selected is selected , the model will be disc@@ arded .
I can &apos;t know that .
I am adjacent to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ma you sit in with which I developed my own relationship over the course of the months with telephone rates and a two and a half hours .
I like a guy .
we often have much , if we speak .
the prison authorities said that I don &apos;t a witness and a journalist , so I will not allow me to take a not@@ ebook , a not@@ ebook and a bul@@ let to draw , what I see .
I need to try to remember all the details .
a re@@ journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , acc@@ use me to Twitter , my im@@ perme@@ ability .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of a prisoner , as he wants , and you will receive free access .
I dis@@ agree with it .
you used to make , that &quot; it could have been able to put it better , &quot; but it might think it &apos;s wrong about what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he does not say what I would write to me , and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants to present that an international re@@ porter in re@@ porter there , to be there .
when he dies , he think that the public relation work is to help against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ lication of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is believed to be sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the event , please hear the series of Pod@@ casts that I made .
I want to go back to all details .
I can &apos;t say that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is not guilty .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese , his actions will give him a conc@@ e@@ al@@ ment of a crime .
but I think there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood that he is not guilty of death .
I believe that there is no sufficient evidence to justify a death penalty .
I think that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him .
I can not claim it really to be object .
there will be other re@@ porter through the party on which you can use it .
what you will get by me , is what it means to see a man of unnecessary deaths .

Peter Moo@@ dy , that Ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria had tried to install a Spi@@ on in his stables , and threatened to re @-@ end the race after .
he insi@@ sted on the ste@@ wards and the Vienna Department of Racing Victoria and held that they provide a personal campaign against him with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a racing day treatment , the last straw .
Moo@@ dy , Fair@@ fax Media , said he tries to do is best for the racing , and he even has found himself in difficult conditions as to explain the positive Kob@@ ant @-@ pe@@ at sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
it had just kept 18 months because of the spi@@ on@@ age fellow , and didn &apos;t want to see that there are &quot; out@@ vision &quot; as a great grape . &quot;
&quot; I thought nothing to say anything about this , and I have been looking for a long time , but sometimes you are quite fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes down to me , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
you know that it went on .
sometimes you may know , and you have to live with the consequences , and I must live what I said .
I will go home and sleeping well .
I wanted to see this , and I want to see that my owners think , that I try my best for her .
if they begin to think about , I do not do it , then I should not be any more coach .
I must then consider what I do myself with my license .
prior to that , Moo@@ dy had moved the Bom@@ b in an interview with Vi@@ rac@@ ing@@ .com , the integr@@ ator department had tried to fill his stable .
before eigh@@ teen months , Ter@@ ry Ba@@ iley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - and I will tell him a collection at my stables to learn about what I would do within my hand , &quot; said Moo@@ dy at Rac@@ ing@@ .com .

if that is the case , you should surely touch to your n@@ oses , because they have put it to a touch in the attempt to gr@@ asp .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former President of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , current President of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ ard , current CEO of Route L , stood on its time and are still evident today .
should I bring me to what it is personally ?
is the RV@@ L has celebrated us and makes people outside of train@@ ers responsible for what is going forward in the sector ?
I was bad for the sector ?
I was so bad for the sector ?
perhaps I think people there outside , that I am .
perhaps they will have my license , and I have put me out , and I haven &apos;t seen any doubt that what I say , I think they can think about it .
but I am now getting to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter which I sad me .
this makes me been sad .
I will am@@ end the pressure on them and they too , to make a decision to meet .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fresh@@ ness of the teachers will be built with the long @-@ awaited cobalt study in Li@@ dar@@ i , and in the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching , that he could not be possible to carry out his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for its famous master , Black C@@ avi@@ ar , indicated the racing @-@ time treatment instructions &quot; after a pack of mud and sound on the horse &apos;s eye , which reached the rules of the rules .

I must assume the full responsibility , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my collabor@@ ator came to w@@ m@@ ate mud to the b@@ ills .
it could have been last night in night .
it would have been something the whole day so that what was so too .
it also had so on the racing day .
Moo@@ dy is able to continue with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with pack@@ et at the race day . an inquiry was opened in this affair .
it is a jo@@ ke .
people who don &apos;t provide these rules , don &apos;t know anything about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need to follow , but here you still have gone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer and Bell@@ amy can fight for Riv@@ als due to alle@@ g@@ ations .
Melbourne @-@ Strom @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy placed criticism against the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of his player as &quot; agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the NR@@ L .
Sydney Sk@@ ats Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rer in the Storm @-@ being &quot; ring@@ ing &quot; with his team during the score in Sydney at the qualifying performance in Sydney on Friday evening have only allowed .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Home Bennett was a barely covered pad of the North American co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample code &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League , saying that the gap in Queensland is not &quot; too good &quot; in the conflict .
in Bell@@ amy , the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ p defended his team , saying that she wants to focus on the Tac@@ kl@@ ing only on their &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy explained that the criticism of the two main coach based on his team &apos;s team would be distinct , because they were wor@@ ried about the Storm @-@ team to be beaten up by the Storm @-@ Team .
&quot; that is getting out again - I haven &apos;t heard that there are Robinson &apos;s Robinson , when she did not ask us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I guarantee that we have changed in our def@@ ensive system or techniques used throughout the year . but in the last six weeks , we made our contact with tac@@ kl@@ o , and which has become a great turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has now been there for three years and he has obviously has a fantastic crew for his people . therefore , he is probably not able to lose ordinary people , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny actually , as this always appears again to this season .
Bell@@ agio has not attacked and rub@@ bing from the &quot; ex@@ iting football &quot; and to keep its ment@@ or that Benn@@ ings St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gol@@ u won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; play @-@ piece &quot; football .
the movie that is exciting football .
he placed his game on Saturday night with our on Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember the year 2010 , when George &apos;s being a red team , and L@@ po@@ ds said that he will take care of a di@@ vor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game , which you &apos;d like to play this kind of players .
he did this statement in 2010 , and now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team , two players , as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so they can play as those with that .
I have betra@@ yed more confidence , because they say they say , because they &apos;re a bit wor@@ ried about to play against us .
they probably have not intended for the big game six weeks ago , when it was on the big game .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm &quot; s a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos with co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos is probably a good game , I haven &apos;t put it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is that one exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points something cl@@ amping ?
for me , the player plans are too .
if they want to mention , it means that we will meet in a phase that are still alive .
the Storm team has won their right to participate in this weekend either North Queensland w@@ boys and the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks , invited next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales start on Saturday morning at the ticket office .
Ser@@ bians with 200,000 $ deposit to drug on@@ kl@@ age
a person , which may rise to a life @-@ long sentence to be sentenced to 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , but they would be picked up after Queensland , as being free as a deposit of 200,000 $ .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after police left 100 kg the drug tra@@ cked on the Yacht Sol@@ ay via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed , just like his co @-@ def@@ endants during the morning , and later in the café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite being a vital sentence for attempts to hold a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , we argued that there is no evidence that he was trying to have the entire amounts and might have been of a harm@@ less nature in the café .
the judge on the High Court of Justice , Peter Flanders , was over the mean change at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared his judgment on Wednesday .
when the criminal cause , he was the police on his position .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c mother and father @-@ pursuing a security deposit of $ 200,000 as a security forces to reach its release .
by reading the mat@@ ernal aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its of these persons , it is clear that the edition of a safety of 200,000 dollars had a real financial burden , &quot; says Richter Flan@@ agan .
but that alone will not be enough to hold it , not to be released , he warned them .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released as a deposit , and under the conditions that he is holding its Australian and his Serb pass , when police have a daily , and at 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 hours .

Stev@@ an Ho@@ gg used the phone of girls to attract P@@ uri@@ oph@@ ile as a rope of pictures
a bl@@ ur@@ oph@@ lie used the telephone of a 11 @-@ year old girl in order to demand pictures of child mol@@ est@@ ations .
Stev@@ an Ho@@ y took the telephone of the child when this sle@@ pt , log@@ istic in an online , aging service , where he received a number of un@@ attended images of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl later a@@ wo@@ ke later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleep@@ y Ho@@ y .
she looked at it through , the pu@@ zzling mel@@ on and obli@@ ging them to leave their mother .
the police arrested some words , and saw the five images , analyzed the five images , analyzed in which one found the address and discovered the report of the &quot; Web Research Group , &quot; the notion of looking for a permanent photos of children .
in the time of the officials , he claimed it that he would have done to &quot; P@@ uri@@ oph@@ ile in the Internet &quot; and he was &quot; presented , &quot; a police force to be dis@@ rup@@ ted her .
the attorney general , Ei@@ li@@ ie Robertson , said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said that it would be a good choice - that he was ad@@ dic@@ ated to man people .
he admitted that the search were carried out on the computer from him , but he said , had happened because he wanted to prevent a police force to be his co@@ h@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked after his conversations with the unknown person who sent him images , and whom he asked to send us more photos .
he said that he did it to press her .
he said he was sick of looking at a head , and he said he wanted to see images of rape and murder .
MS Robertson has added : &quot; when the girls found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was in the citrus notes and on the wines .
they also looked like the ir@@ respective images on their phone and even far@@ med the def@@ endants .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ endants used to speak computer and Playst@@ ation in order to speak with girls who did much younger than that .
Ho@@ y , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ dee , that ple@@ aded not guilty to the indictment by the last year on the 14th of January this year , and not before Court transferred to a hearing on 24 March this year .
defense lawyer Gregor S@@ im , therefore , that Ho@@ gg could not appear on the register of sexual crimes , as we argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postp@@ oned the verdict of the Jud@@ gment in October to receive background reports about social work .

contrary to the most important competitors of the VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Astra will initially only be the five @-@ door .
the second variation will be followed in the spring of the station , which is also on show at the IAA 2013 .
and what will be more compact after the Astra at the IAA 2013 ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault the fourth generation of its Astra competitors like Mé@@ gan@@ e .

because of injury of their lives , in@@ mates have not entitled to financial compensation if they are contained in small cells .
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
most people can hope the judges pay to hope if they were imprisoned for only a few days in the spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee was successful with his constitutional assessment in Karlsruhe . he was placed in the Department of Justice in Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square metres of floor space ; the toilet was not separated .
afterwards the man ended up in a bigger cell in the meantime , after the attack of his arri@@ vals .
his official policy point for the country of Berlin failed because of the powerful mo@@ v@@ ague conditions of the country of Berlin .
however , the constitutional judge raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber in Berlin and rejected the case to the re @-@ re@@ submission it .
you will see the man &apos;s rights .
the chamber findings state decided upon the amount of the compensation .
even if for legal reasons in the fra@@ ctive period , only a few days of imprisonment for the war was not allowed , the name was given .
otherwise , &quot; a full of the legal protection of the personality is to be afraid . &quot;
the chamber of the chamber must clari@@ fy the amount of the Army .
the constitutional judge , in the past , have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
so she was not subject to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April of a det@@ ain@@ ee because he was naked in a single cell .
human un@@ an is a decision of 2011 , also the multiple people sharing a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , Karlsruhe confirmed the decision to include the Berlin constitutional court which had taken an in@@ mate in a parallel event in November 2009 .
the previous treas@@ urer was the case for a period of three months , from 15 to 21 hours a day as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the pris@@ ons were here in the last weeks due to lack of staff into the head@@ lines .
so after all these prisoners favorable to the war again 23 hours , as ag@@ ger@@ m increases , even to b@@ assi@@ sts may have come to it because of the unique situation .
according to the Department of Justice for 21 offices in Te@@ gel , 16 places were not occupied for young men starting in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create &quot;
the influ@@ x of refugees is a enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what is come to Germany ?
according to the projections of the ministry in this year , around 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are coming after Germany &apos;s testimony of vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record one million refugees .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) showed a view of the unusual challenge of resolution : &quot; I say to again and again : we can create , and we create that . &quot;
what comes to Germany is conve@@ yed to the following overview .
the period is needed after various forecasts up to 190 000 ( estimate of the Austrian Ministry of Economic Affairs ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) per year - though the next five years .
this is twice as much as it is built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
dramatic change is the lack of living room , but above all in paid rental objects : annual rate of 3,000 000 to 80 000 partners are out of the rental car , to get those at a particularly favourable apartments .
Federal Minister of Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) is why the promotion is dou@@ bling up from $ 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is the kind of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 partners per year would have to be reck@@ oned and would normally need to spend a subsi@@ dies of 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
both agree with scientists and the Federal Minister in the fact that there are also more advantages of investments in the residential building .
estimates by the Institute of Arbeits@@ markt@@ - und Berufs@@ forschung , estimates that some 55 percent of their refuge in Germany are able to be employed in Germany .
however , the refugees wouldn &apos;t want to make them quali@@ fications in Germany in order to help them for career , together with Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
today , however , for the integration of refugees , however , crucial are whether they work in Germany .
labour is the key for social contacts , for the appreciation in the exceptional company , but also for the evaluation of the im@@ migrant , says the migration scientist Dietrich Colonel Sch@@ hardt , said .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ ang@@ hardt , there was a political shift , and from the ban of the refugees for the recognition of work .
while still there was a ban on asylum seek@@ ers for up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Resi@@ denz@@ strasse whose asylum seek@@ ers will be limited to one place .
in society the society has also changed - due to the expert team members - mainly the visibility is made possible that the refugees to the job market should be improved .
a great hur@@ dle for the entrance to the labour market are missing in German speaking countries .
until now , there &apos;s not yet a sufficient special offer on general and work @-@ related language courses .
research has also shown that jobs will be conve@@ yed by personal contacts .
therefore , the foundation of networks is the view of Thr@@ ang@@ hardt to the Royal Path &apos;s degree of integration .
the Berlin School government has found that only a few lie parents gave their children in Kit@@ &apos;s , it will only be very important to work together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Co@@ schem@@ atic , Sp@@ ok@@ es@@ for Youth and Family in the Berlin Senate .
to convince the family still convince the advantages of the K@@ ita family , the administration can be distributed in various languages .
if the need for educ@@ ating increased by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate eventually try to increase the training capacity - by increasing the vocational schools .
in the countries , students are prepared to start with German cuisine in welcome classes .
they are not always trained by fully trained teacher and teacher , but also as in Berlin , also from teachers , who have only received the qualification in English as a second language .
there is no lack of evidence , comments , and clothes are made by the Berlin School government .
the German student works , estimated that 20 percent of the refugees in Germany are studying at Germany .
in principle there does not speak any asylum seek@@ ers or in teaching the course - the only exception was until now Berlin , Inn@@ ens@@ ed Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now cleared his position .
studies of plan has to be facilit@@ ated with the University .
because of refugees with a common issue or Dul@@ ce you no guarantee on the asylum seek@@ er law . &quot; more when they start a degree in law .
the latter also get in general no B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G , since they are not covered by the circle of the af@@ ög@@ ing persons .
yet , patient who had to lived in Germany for four years , and first met B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G @-@ entitled , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
also these financing vessels has to be closed , but Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the German Student &apos;s Association .
students have been allowed to receive B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G .
Islam will join an important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslim , and for many people are the religion of their identity .
however , the State should be gradually rolling by the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing State of churches must continue to develop a new state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ capitalist relations .
it is also important to the establishment of a Islamic f@@ light@@ ers , who takes care of the curi@@ osity .
among the right hand , duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam have to be able to work out from clear and ready to work in many areas with the state in many sectors .
in addition to this , the willingness of a willingness to bear with religious approaches .
the chairman of the Muslims , Aim@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , said : &quot; not to take care of the fear of religious conflicts , they could be considered .
those who wanted to say such conflicts in Germany in Germany , &quot; have immediately used her right to come here , in Germany , &quot; said he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law upon Arabic .
integration is now significantly more than today an issue of the company .
in this , the majority of the majority , the majority of discrimination and rac@@ ism is ur@@ ged .
Germany has - as a result of European decision - since a decade ago , a non @-@ discri@@ min@@ atory attitude and a General of equality law .
nonetheless , it gets very slowly , as the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ an showed , in the police and authorities , it was systematically being pushed to the concentration camp .
equal opportunities for everyone , as migrant organisations and the stakeholders of non @-@ white German states are to be asked where they will be able to stay in the next few years , if the country stay together peac@@ efully and his new citizens should use their facilities - for the benefit of today .
in general , Germany is the unable to supply the under@@ way to this expected refugees , Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes the one of the expected refugees .
&quot; what managers - power and capacities , we create , &quot; said he said to the Day of the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , some additional money can flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery is requ@@ esting g@@ om@@ ery , all of the representative of health cards .
all performances could be reck@@ oned with the federal states in later .
and long @-@ term it was highly un@@ founded , so many people can agree with limited notice . to view the asylum applic@@ ator .
otherwise the doctors will come into everything the language boundaries .
so far so , the Berlin Health Sciences The@@ a Bor@@ de has already been used , migrants difficult from its diseases was intended to work more than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical sur@@ g@@ eries , should also be taken to tan@@ gible .
many refugees had to do with even more important medical start @-@ ups in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with a different diagnostic view .
taking the refugee crisis in 2010 , there is clearly more unexpected disabilities , and with the young people , it is with HIV .
with the other similar pictures of the people the German doctors of their vocational training is clear , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite fall or tuber@@ culo@@ sis are not as hard to acknow@@ ledge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s the physician &apos;s most possibly goes through the refugees in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed educational system , several refugees and doctors .
in order to practice , however , they would need to be correct and correct the quality and if possible .
at least half of the participating countries in Germany are transferring to the Mail of the Mail @-@ sy@@ olo@@ ur@@ u state ( B@@ PT@@ K ) psych@@ ic condition : most of the disease suffer from post@@ trau@@ matic stress ( or in depression ) .
concerned they are viol@@ ate refugee kids , &quot; says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study by TU Munich reported that every fifth of Syrian refugee family are trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
who is interested in a post trau@@ matic stress , suffering from the so @-@ called Flash@@ backs caused a short@@ ness of breath , dizziness , cor@@ t@@ ness , and mortality .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration camps , strong damp@@ er and emotional vi@@ dity .
in order to prevent them , symptoms chron@@ ically destroyed , may be an early treatment necessary , Mun@@ z declared :
however , only four per cent of the psych@@ ic sick being used for psycho@@ therapy .
in fact , psych@@ ic sick seek@@ ers in the social difficulties , a motion for psycho@@ therapy , but the treatment lasts for several months .
moreover , in the social difficulties , mostly non @-@ workers or doctors who are not trained to the psych@@ ic diseases , whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this lead to progress in calculations , says Mun@@ z .

MR Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the steps from the year at the beginning of the year .
he remained unchanged , but the case of a case spread rapidly over the soci@@ ology .

FC al @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that the team @-@ mate was shooting in front of the game against Dyn@@ amo Zagreb behind the ver@@ last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere .
Wen@@ ger emphasized by Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only in September and unless his Rehabilitation plan goes to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere knows at least the next four games to England and , in view of its history , his participation in the next summer of European Championship is certainly un@@ certain .
the great pain in this current problem is , Wil@@ sh@@ ere has finished the last season after a separate per@@ le injury left the last season and then returned to its old spon@@ ge during pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury was not the career &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone , which do not healed .
there is no larger matter .
this was an accident .
it was not in connection with his bra@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries which had previously had .
this may be out of pure , medical perspective , but how Wen@@ ger also accepted , there is the corresponding danger of further injuries , always when a player tries to return to the middle of the season .
it is also developed a pleasant pattern .
the study by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ ú@@ ries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ as 157 hap@@ pier @-@ games in the last five seasons .
the broader image for ar@@ sen@@ al is that she played in six of the eight races since 2007 / 08 at one of the two Premier League Club , which in the case of f@@ law@@ less .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil rock in ar@@ sen@@ al , but that would provide an improvement in the vulner@@ ability during the last season .
&quot; well , if you &apos;re coming back from an injury , you have a random time period , in which you must strengthen your body and battle top , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack has young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body is stabili@@ zed , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the type he deser@@ ves .
Arsenal starts its Champions League @-@ season last Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lane at the next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger will come a press within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey dates not to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ o@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start with war .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with Ki@@ er@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and play the players who require a small break @-@ up break , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
although the ar@@ sen@@ al favor@@ ites are beginning to continue with Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the places with the highest ratings effect in Europe .
Dyn@@ amo is un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; un@@ defeated &quot; campaign was launched for the last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken by a earthquake on Tuesday evening , with a view of the Richter scale .
this year , it was the 10th place in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that ar@@ sen@@ al the teaching of the last season with the Champions League promot@@ er against Monaco . it remains to be driven by the distant future , with his management the association to its first European Cup in victory .
&quot; this drive is fine , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never been running with Arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I have been very close enough for business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not mist@@ aken .
Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest : a comedy show that deals with serious lessons on male lessons .
the lack of similar represent@@ ations of shows is obviously , especially in terms of what the need for men , to open up now , now desper@@ ate more desper@@ ate than ever before , as suicide attacks on a 15 @-@ year high@@ s .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of cause in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains more frequent in men than women in women .
in an effort to raise the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst A@@ ainst Human@@ ity ( CA@@ LM ) campaign counts as one of the man &apos;s poo@@ rest lives in 2015 , with the aim of changing the culture in question , to find men who looking for if they need them .

a current study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ press@@ ant symptoms , noted that if the suff@@ erer completed a sufficient percentage of friends with &quot; healthy tuning , &quot; his chances of recovery was doubled .
for those who are not de@@ press@@ ant , a circle of spir@@ it@@ ry @-@ friends is the risks of mental problems .
but of course I need not even friends , so that a friendship work can work .
in the age of over social media , communication , with its focus on style is the immun@@ ity of the response is often more important than a meaning@@ ful full contact .
our digital life have the need to be powerful , life @-@ friendly and successful , even if in reality the insulation was dominated .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by law , psych@@ ologists , and in@@ trin@@ sic values - money , image , social status , everything on costs in@@ trin@@ sic values - our house lon@@ ging to personal development and friendship which rises to our spiritual health a lot of depth .
and just like a vide@@ o@@ el inventor , and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can not buy now .
the Schön@@ e in Friends was that this focus on the head was put on the head .
every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , that is spark@@ ed by interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers are frequent use in small arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging behind Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that guys can refer to any case too , even if they are often to keep their feelings too .
as a worker into the telephone @-@ past@@ oral tradition , it declared : &quot; &quot; my audience for people who are de@@ press@@ ant attacks and war@@ riors are pleasing at me , they can really show me how even the smallest interventions of friends may make a difference . &quot;
the men that contact us feel , often are not able to speak with friends , as we are able to speak with friends .
the old phrase that &quot; I come to right &quot; has a huge impact , as that &quot; weakness &quot; is perceived as weakness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me in the sense if I try to offer long @-@ term tac@@ tic mechanisms .
she presents very clearly , the little moments of short@@ ened rolls .
as a very old external out@@ si@@ can status view the phone the people in desp@@ air and desp@@ air can also help , long @-@ term support is coming from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit from a Central Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest that , at this weekend , visit the Day totally refurb@@ ished mind , so why don &apos;t take your friends to a drink in Central Peru .
or , even better if you can see in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , check your smile and tell him a smile .

to help PS@@ G to help Mal@@ mo@@ ist to help O@@ G .
Angel Di Maria is compatible with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ ui@@ di and Ed@@ inson Reli@@ ani to his hits on Malm@@ ö .
di Maria are passing the Champions League at the Champions League at Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to move on Malm@@ ö .
here are the Game Report and the response to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ as well maintained his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prince &apos;s Square stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League &apos;s debut as PS@@ G , which took the way to the French master , but subsequently she missed a number of opportunities , before they achieved a head race at the 6@@ 1st minute in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and S@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also needed in Paris a strong start against the Swedish champion , because they are not only fatal for the position of K.@@ F@@ .-@@ s . also an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ alists in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was no class game from Laurent Blan@@ cs team and it was worth taking part in the gate . he was later entitled to his home town team and by the club , where he started his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or sec@@ urely in the Champions League . thus , it &apos;s a good start to win back and relaxed at which even if there is certain things we have experienced in over the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is an excellent sign .
we wanted to win and won we won , although I regre@@ t that we didn &apos;t get another or two further goals . &quot;
in his violation of Article 2 : 2 , we returned to Paris after an injury in the Paris @-@ Team and lost his own place at the stadium in the first league , but he was eliminated in fourth minute by Paul Maria .
the Argent@@ in@@ ean coup was taken out as the man who had taken over the next month in Manchester , when he was in the final month of Manchester United . when he was come to speak of the Malm@@ ö opposite to take place in Johan Wil@@ and was nicely done in the long ski area of the multilingual network .
if someone had believed that PS@@ G would be a big win , he won &apos;t be dis@@ appointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Cel@@ tic had proposed to play this level , entered the field with nine national players on the field and was with a five @-@ man @-@ defense and two deep in the mid@@ field of having a heavy opponent .
but don &apos;t want to miss a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ j@@ ic , who passes away in the 3rd minute , by turning the posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little bit around the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself had been on discharge themselves , with some mis@@ carriage of mis@@ carriage , but not least of the failed attempts for less than five trials , in the first half of p@@ atz@@ weiler . it was abandoned for Cav@@ as after re@@ boot after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless , he proved a lot more speed when he brought his players into the game , and it was a pass of the mar@@ g@@ movi@@ c taking into a turning strip , that was adapted to the post in the 5@@ 2nd minute ...
the second goal was finally left shortly after the hours @-@ mark , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans had his sixth season , after he had walked straight to you on the left @-@ hand side of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö brought to play in the game , and comes only an excellent car to stop by David Lu@@ iz , so the final result is low , before sp@@ amm@@ ate sp@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi won a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age of Har@@ eide , led to that PS@@ G gave a class on his team , and the Norwegian party said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then , we played only in the Swedish League , which did not see the same level .
the quali@@ fications you don &apos;t go out . &quot;
hat@@ s off to Paris !
it was a great play of them !

it wasn &apos;t his third successful start in its last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this year &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen of each game , and therefore I will concentrate on it onto the game .
the newly designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit series of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he hit four hits against Seattle Shi@@ ers on July 6 .

the Tiger was achieved from three quarters in the first two inside against the case @-@ stand @-@ veter@@ an , prior to the mail@@ ing of injuries in front of the mail@@ ings , after he missing more than a month beyond the back of the case .
obviously , the beginning I was wishing to me , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt what I had used , and felt that I would do some pretty Pit@@ ches because in the third inning . &quot;
after they received the first v@@ ad@@ off of batt@@ ants she received a single record , Second Bas@@ eman , Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z , Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , took the game that made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .

amazing artists signed three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) Dorn@@ bracht has one of the main works , the Ot@@ avi Alt , made for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and translation of the Bible .
at the beginning was the word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ te @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now been published with superb pictures .
in the beginning I was the picture for Ot@@ ta Alt , who has been form@@ ulates in 150 Mo@@ tives , his own personal interpret@@ ations of portrait stories on paper and screen .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms finished the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which he certainly does not know with &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary , the respective topics could be adapted to the particular sand .
for three years , Ot@@ mar castle worked on his Bible project for whom he had an subj@@ ectively created program of many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
we have created cycles of such as the Way of the Cross , Pl@@ ague , Ten Command@@ ments , and fa@@ ther@@ ing our issues .
so he talked about several partners , the same applies for the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological alignment , as well as the Kettler company @-@ Verlag with its main focus on art books .
and this is the author of Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has been dealt with the particular Bible with the particular Bible .
he has interpreted the most significant knowledge of the Bible in Ot@@ ta Alt , and define the information being translated into recent connections . &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ al view of Al@@ ts painting .
it is located between the original biblical account of Martin Luther and , each in a set of the artist , which form@@ ulates here his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the gem spaces is a golden color .
so , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a double profound insight into his soul , and its emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were finally here for the Bible project : Ot@@ ta Alt , 1940 was born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin . it comes from a family which belonged to the strict Protestant powers of the world .
&quot; it happened that most of them have been done with the pipe stock &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looks like Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; I keep the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; I can say nothing to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is nothing what &apos;s going to do anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this must be interested in each sense of this theme , &quot; said DF@@ B &apos;s CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this topic will surely be a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football could only be prepared to help .
the decisive step must , however , must be the policy .
for this reason , the German Football Association is therefore a refugee &apos;s purpose &quot; 1 / 0 for a warm welcome &quot; by four years .
through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation we have made sure that this programme until 2019 is running , &quot; says Ni@@ ers@@ bach , at the edge of the UEFA conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
a number of states also support this program .
in this weekend the 36 Profi@@ ens will be featured in a clear sign , if they are held on the left tri@@ cot lining of the usual Spon@@ sor@@ row logos ( Hermes ) .

H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the league . &quot;
for example , the EM Quali@@ fications against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women will take 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
in Ni@@ ers@@ bach had the support of refugees as &quot; a large joint work of German football . &quot;
that the 36 license have started to have gotten off in their own projects , is great .
as great is that small and smallest ret@@ ains are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we have spent , is living in the football .
in &quot; this is of enormous importance . &quot; he said .
this and the next year , the association puts together with the DF@@ B selection and includes a total of 300 000 euros between the integration of refugees at one time .

robo@@ tic age : government want to ensure a pioneer in Germany
Germany is said to be a leader of the German federal government &apos;s change of cars .
on Wednesday , the federal cabinet decided a strategy paper from the home of Transport Minister Alexander Dob@@ rin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which looks for further investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Dob@@ rin@@ dt spoke in Frankfurt at the edge of the Autom@@ esse Frankfurt Motor Show in 2004 by a &quot; new mobile research . &quot;
the automated and net@@ worked driving of the transport system will increase and for less st@@ ressing , Dob@@ rin@@ dt joined us .
he also wants to discuss the topic with his counterpart , from the G@@ 7 states , which also meet with representatives from the industry .
the strategy paper entitled , among other things , emphas@@ ising the importance of mobile broadband expansion and an improvement in digital radio systems .
to testing a new technology the test section is currently on the 9 in Bavaria .
in order to take the driver &quot; no additional adher@@ ence to the German government , &quot; the German Government wants to verify the legal framework , and change it necessary to re @-@ adapt to new developments . &quot;
for example , Germany would like to employ an international approval that the allowed maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars of 10 to 130 kilometres of k@@ ph .
the German Government also wants to deplo@@ y a change in the Wiener Agreement , which is currently being co @-@ driver to people than the driver .
in automated driving , the car takes over the driver &apos;s guide , the driver will learn more and more to fit .
the technology is based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
after a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art research project , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible to motor@@ ways by 2020 .
nevertheless just disabled vehicles are still expected to come on public roads &quot; until 2020 . &quot;
the added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at its site in Germany are currently contributing to around 8.4 billion euros in 2025 .
&quot; the digital networking of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to greater reliability and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD Executive Officer S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l .
the question of liability in accidents and security of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied .
still the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars however looks still skep@@ ticism - much more than French or Americans .
a Wednesday exp@@ at the AA report of the For@@ sa National Institute for the review , only eight percent of Germans believe that in the coming ten years , 32 percent will be expected in the coming ten years , 31 percent will not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 per cent of respondents intend to 2025 by car in Germany , the US 33 percent .
in case the car driver are not ready to leave in Germany , yet it is entirely running on a self @-@ vehicle vehicle .
according to a Digital @-@ venture increase , only seven percent agree to be approved throughout the route on all roads .
at the highway , there are just 15 percent of traffic in the flow of running transport .
on any other , the car left the control of no circumstances .

when you dies , you go into the museum .
this impressive collection had been made before the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsthalle , Roger Die@@ deren - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

EU want to double mercury limit in room @-@ fishing
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large amounts and acc@@ u@@ ated by consumers to a significantly higher dose of the nervous system .
the consumer company An@@ smart@@ watch , which critic@@ ised the plans with the EU paper , critic@@ ised the plans by strong : &quot; risks and side effects are reduced by full range of balance and inf@@ ants , &quot; explains Matthias &apos;s schmi@@ dt of Food@@ watch .
Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt are looking for the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain - for example on a two milli@@ grams of mercury can be raised by one to two milli@@ grams per kilogra@@ m .
large volumes are already similar today with mercury , but already the current threshold values are not sold by only 50 percent of the case .
after dou@@ bling the limits are only 14.@@ 5 percent of inde@@ struc@@ tible .
as a result of this subject , the EU aims to feed the threshold values of 0.5 mg to 0.1 milli@@ grams per kilogra@@ m of trans@@ duc@@ ting cycles per kilogra@@ m .
Food@@ Tec had this but known as &quot; tri@@ ck , &quot; because smaller cem@@ fic , like car@@ p , were usually around as low as car@@ p , they already comply with the planned maximum values .
therefore the lowering of the d@@ yl@@ ish should be , however , a per@@ age man@@ oeuvre , which helps the economy alone , &quot; declared Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt .
mercury is a high @-@ quality heavy metal @-@ metal which is tight to the food chain in particular in big @-@ fishing .
the federal government is why the fact that &quot; small amounts of damage of the nervous system was estimated to have been inf@@ lic@@ ted on the nervous system . &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Monetary Affairs explains in his homepage on the market , however , that a &quot; health concerns of the general population &quot; should not be expected .
mercury peaks above all due to the carbon @-@ burning in the environment .
the German coal @-@ fired power plant was according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Education in the Green Bundestag , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock , in excess of six tons of mercury in 2012 , equivalent to two @-@ thirds of total sales in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in f@@ ishings , like in river Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently about and how it exceeded , &quot; the level of paper was cited in March from a paper .
