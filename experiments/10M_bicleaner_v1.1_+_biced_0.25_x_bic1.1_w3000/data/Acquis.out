purpose of this part of the Convention , which is required to implement the provisions of divi@@ der I via securing measures as required .
the aim of the securing measures adopted in this Convention is the tim@@ ely discovery of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for the production of nuclear weapons and other core @-@ heads for unknown purposes as well as the deter@@ rence of such as@@ cen@@ sion through the risk of early discovery .
as a result of the target in Article 28 , the material accounting are used as a securing of basic importance , composite with the spatial input and the observation as an important supple@@ mentary measures .
the technical conclusion of tests by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which for each material pr@@ one zone , which is listed for a certain period of material quantity , indicating the accuracy limits for the specified measurement .
when conducting research tests , the organization makes 3 full use of the Community &apos;s safety system .
the accounting and control system of the community for nuclear materials in accordance with this agreement is based on a breakdown in material bil@@ lows zones .
in the use of their securing measures , the community will make use of de procedures and measures to use the following way , as far as necessary , as far as they are determined in comple@@ mentary formations and purpose include :
a ) a measuring system for determining the quantities of severe , produced , shi@@ fted , lost or any other way from the stock of remote materials and inventory ;
B ) The rating of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurement and estimate of measuring uncertainty ;
C ) Proce@@ dures for determining , assessment and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recei@@ vers ;
( e ) procedures for evaluation of accumulation of un@@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol - and report system that points out for each material @-@ material zone and changes the changes in the area including the one @-@ off and outputs of the material bil@@ lows .
g ) Pre@@ ferences that ensure that the booking procedures and agreements are implemented correctly ;

I ad@@ ore you to confirm the approval of the community to these changes , and strike you as an appointment for the entry into force 1 January 1978 .
I would appreciate if you would confirm the approval of your government to the above .
I ad@@ ore you to confirm the input of your present writing with the following wor@@ ding :
I would appreciate if you would confirm the approval of your government to the above . &quot;
agreement in the form of a letter between the European Economic Community and Bank for International Sett@@ lements ( Member of the Member States ) within the medium @-@ term financial advisory board
the BIS could close stand@@ by credit agreements with central banks of the credi@@ tor countries when banks issue an appropriate application .
the agreement could be closed down to the total amount paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor and within a total limit of 2,@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounts ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future provisions of the member countries .
however , some conditions are now listed below , whose application would be the BI@@ Z .
at every Stand@@ by credit , the BIS initially would take over a commitment to two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als stocks , without having to be exceeded five years .
in the opening of the credits , as well as their mou@@ ld@@ est extension , the BIS would charge a loan commission .
in addition , the first draw would not be implemented before the procedure of a month after deduc@@ ting the Stand@@ by agreement , so the Bank can provide the required adjust@@ ments of their own liqui@@ dity .
the draw would occur in the currencies of the agreement at the disposal of the agreement , highly likely in U.S. dollars ; they would extend to periods involved in taking the funds of the bank , three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those which the BIS is turning towards the respective point in similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market treasures .
however , if the BC@@ Z has to provide the necessary funds even on the market , then the current rate of interest may reach a maximum , which equ@@ ates to an appropriate margin .
I would be thank@@ ful for you to inform me of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; the BIS could close stand@@ by credit agreements with central banks of the credi@@ tor countries when banks issue an appropriate application .
I would be thank@@ ful for you to inform me the approval of the Council of the European Communities . &quot;
I honour me to inform you the approval of the Council of the European Communities to the contents of this writing .

a reag@@ ent for blood group identification must react with all tested blood samples which contain the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olo@@ g , the antibodies or another on the label specified .
if a reag@@ ent is recommended in the manufacturer recommended , the following factors or appar@@ itions cannot appear : a ) ha@@ em@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the title is measured by a further di@@ lution of the re@@ lu@@ ent re@@ ag@@ ulation to double the medium in a suitable medium .
the title is the re@@ frac@@ tional value of the number of the strongest power dil@@ uted in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated from the volume of blood circulation in total volume .
in Anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents that should be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time that is required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has specified for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D reag@@ ents for blood group determination International standards , and for reag@@ ents of other specific@@ ity are currently being executed by standards .
an international standard award , according to definition , contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles that are observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the reag@@ ents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ists , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions with an ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes .
the title gives the di@@ lution of the Re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es in the last mix within a series which occurs during a micro@@ scop@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination .
the effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood group determination are present ( at present anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the title of unknown Re@@ action in International units ( See Bulletin WHO 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring it back to a volume of 1 ml , it contains the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren , according to definition 256 International units per ml .
the preparations are available for free from the International Laboratory for biological nor@@ ms of World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Serum Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of an compar@@ ative tit@@ ration of the International High @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A reag@@ ents ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC F@@ IL@@ E = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a reag@@ ent is stored under the manufacturer recommended conditions , his required properties will remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a reag@@ ent form according to the label lies at most a year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date of the expi@@ ration date for dry re@@ agen@@ ces is aimed at the results of the expi@@ ration experiments ; it is appro@@ ving by the public supervisory authorities .
drying reag@@ ents are kept in a atmosphere of iner@@ tia gas or in a vacuum and in the glass container where they have been dried and so closed that no moisture can penet@@ rate .
a dry reag@@ ent may not exceed 0,5 v.@@ H. of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ or oxide at a pressure of no more than 0.0@@ 2 mm Hg within 24 hours .
for avoiding bacterial growth , the relevant state authority can determine that the reag@@ ent ( or the use of the dry reag@@ ents supplied ) an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic are added to the requirement of specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin of blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of flu@@ o@@ ily or recur@@ sive ser@@ ums .
the reag@@ ents , in@@ different , whether in an immer@@ sive form or after re@@ jection , must be transparent and must not contain se@@ di@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
for the international exchange of certain reag@@ ents for blood group determination , as if possible , not artificial colored , at least as long as the international agreement has come across a unified system .
reag@@ ents for blood group determination are in such a way and spread in such quantities that this is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity of this quantity must be so large that the content is necessary to carry out the efficacy described in this protocol described in the efficacy of efficacy .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has over all production levels and controls of the reag@@ ents for blood group determination .
reasonable samples of all @-@ given reag@@ ents are so long taken from the laboratory , until with some lik@@ el@@ ihood that the batch can no longer be used .
the reag@@ ents used for blood group determination may contain substances human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary tools to rein@@ forcement the effectiveness and preservation of the reag@@ ent stability .
for technical reasons these reag@@ ents are classified according to the origin of their effective appearance in three groups .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ent human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal reag@@ ents contain no substances of human origin .
in every single tank a black label is available in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the quantity or , at dried reag@@ ents , the quantity and composition of the re@@ jection needed liquid ,
additionally , this label or label is on the box in which the containers may include , or the containers included the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3 . the quantity or , at dried reag@@ ents , the quantity and composition of the re@@ jection needed liquid ,
each program is a certificate of certification according to Article 4 of the Convention corresponding to this protocol .
anti @-@ A serum can be obtained from the blood of selected group B , which can be immune due to red blood cells or by specific substances of the group A .
anti @-@ A serum and glut@@ in@@ ous human red blood cells that contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the group A and AB , including the sub@@ group A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B . there are no human red blood cells that contain no A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the current , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparations of the anti @-@ A blood group or a corresponding comparison par@@ ate against floods of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells .
the effectiveness of the server must not be less than 64 International units per ml .
for instance , anti @-@ A serum can be mixed upon an object carriers with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent between A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells , which is required if the same attempt is carried out with the anti @-@ A blood group or a standard pre @-@ par@@ ate of the same avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ B serum can be obtained from the blood of selected group A , which can be immune due to red blood cells or by specific substances of group B .
anti @-@ B serum and glut@@ in@@ ous human red blood cells that contain B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups B and AB ; it is glut@@ in@@ ous no human red blood cells that do not contain any B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the current , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparations of the anti @-@ B blood group or a corresponding comparison @-@ saving of B @-@ blood cells .
if anti @-@ B serum can be mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent , ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double period , which is necessary if the same attempt is carried out with the anti @-@ B blood group or with a standard pre @-@ par@@ ate of the same avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum can be obtained from the blood of selected group 0 which can be immune to group A and the group B immune cells .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum and glut@@ in@@ ous human red blood cells , which include ag@@ glut@@ in@@ u@@ genic A and / or B group AB , including sub @-@ groups A1 and A2 , it is glut@@ in@@ ous no human red blood cells that do not contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ u@@ genic A or B , i.e. those of the group 0 .
it is glut@@ in@@ ous human red blood cells that contain A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) an@@ tigen ( which are not ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ous in general by anti @-@ A serum from group B ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B group ( group 0 ) serum is parallel to the current , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard prepar@@ atory of the anti @-@ A blood group or a corresponding comparison par@@ ate , separated against water currents of A1 and A2 blood cells .
in addition , it is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparations of the anti @-@ B blood group or a corresponding comparison par@@ ate against a flood of B @-@ blood cells .
the effectiveness of the server must not be less than 64 International units per ml .
un@@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also cause a easily identi@@ fiable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B group ( group 0 ) serum can be mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent , ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time , which is necessary if the same attempts have returned with the anti @-@ A blood group or with a standard pre@@ saving of same activity .
if the anti @-@ B + anti @-@ B group ( group 0 ) serum can be mixed with a similar amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent , ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time that is required if the same attempt is carried out with the anti @-@ B blood group or a standard pre @-@ par@@ ate of the same avi@@ dity .
if an anti @-@ B + an anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum can be mixed with the same amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent of blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C .
anti @-@ R@@ h blood @-@ group sera each specific@@ ity can be one of two types that can be distinguished by the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ites , including a ag@@ glut@@ ination hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells .
with others , known as &quot; in@@ complete &quot; , ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in presence of specific col@@ lo@@ ids such as cattle alb@@ um@@ in or with assistance of other special methods .
some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Sera ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ate on object carriers also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells that are har@@ med in their own serum or plasma .
the following demands on the effectiveness of Sera to determine the R@@ h group may possibly change when International standard preparations are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people , which are immune to the An@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the An@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that don &apos;t contain the An@@ tigen D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Sera have to have a score of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0,@@ 9@@ percent cooking level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a &quot; in@@ complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparations for the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) serum or a corresponding comparison of comparison to c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all the red blood cells that contain the An@@ tigen D , the serum should contain the possibility of blood cells , the Do @-@ An@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Sera , intended for use of object carriers according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , have to be mixed at approximately 40 ° C with an object carriers that have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be full within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people , immun@@ ised by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with floods of human red blood cells that contain the An@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain C @-@ an@@ tigen .
these Sera are therefore specifically intended for the C @-@ tigen only , if the tested blood cells are caught in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent cooking level .
the title of the Anti @-@ C Sera ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 vs. C@@ cd@@ de@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ C Sera which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and no form of anti @-@ D blood cells at around 40 ° C ) , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be full within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be full within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ E serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people who are immune to the An@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Sera ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) a title of at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ dd@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ E Sera which are intended to use on object carriers according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in no form of anti @-@ D ) , if they are mixed with a similar quantity of 40@@ - to 50@@ per cent with the same amount of 40 ° C , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within a period of 120 seconds .
sera of the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be extracted directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time as determined by the manufacturer .
if a serum for use on object carriers is determined according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ar should show in all types of red blood cells that show a reaction , not inferior to the ant@@ agon@@ isms of antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals which can be immune to blood cells or specific substances of the group A .
anti @-@ A serum and glut@@ in@@ ous human red blood cells that contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , this is called those of the blood groups A and AB , including the sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B ; it is glut@@ in@@ ous of no human red blood cells that do not contain any A @-@ an@@ tigen which is one of the blood groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the recur@@ rent , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparations of the anti @-@ A blood group or a corresponding comparison par@@ ate , separated with water currents of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) .
an anti @-@ A serum can be mixed upon an object carriers with a similar quantity of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent between A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells , which is required if the same attempt is carried out with the recur@@ sively dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparations of the anti @-@ A blood group or a standard pre@@ par@@ ate of same avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ B serum is extracted from the blood of animals which can be immune due to red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B .
