the present document is a summary of the European public report report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) has judged the conducted studies in order to obtain recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
if you require further information about your disease or their treatment , please read the package file ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you want more information regarding the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 m@@ g. of melt tablets ( tablets , which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for taking ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. , thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and ins@@ ulations ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psych@@ ical disease in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods abnormal high mood ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes , and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
injection solution is used to rapid control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ oral problems , if the oral medication is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can be used to take or the melting tablets in patients , which will prepare the swal@@ low of tablets .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , the same as Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adapted to the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells together .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene probably works mainly as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in less measurements than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itters to activate the recept@@ ors .
since d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and their res@@ ent@@ ment will be prevented .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy , which may occur in symptoms , was examined in three studies by up to a year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar illnesses which had suffered from a placebo over a period of two hours with placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recovery in 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms have been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tion@@ in was developed in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that had suffered from stressed ag@@ itation which compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the variation of symptoms of patients using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment .
the company also conducted studies in order to examine how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to inhal@@ e ( decreases ) .
in both studies with the injec@@ tion@@ able injection solution , Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients who received a placebo .
in applying to the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy was more effective than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
in addition to 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the failure of recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms were identified and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy to take ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , vomiting , bl@@ ur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ ie ( constant motion ) , vomiting , Nau@@ sea ( con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , sp@@ ittle hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( increased sp@@ ection ) , ti@@ redness and exhaus@@ tion , ru@@ th@@ iness , in@@ som@@ nie ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and of moderate to severe acid episodes in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , opposite the risks .
in addition , the Committee came to the result that the advantages of injec@@ tion@@ able rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when an oral therapy is not suitable , opposite the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . an approval for placing from Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to heavy episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode of patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily is independent of meals .
increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not verified , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been detected .
with regard to the larger sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors occur ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the di@@ pi@@ ous ben@@ zene dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavi@@ ours belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective distur@@ ban@@ ces and was reported in some cases after the start or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of a epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased su@@ ici@@ dal exposure with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions used for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( dehy@@ d@@ ration ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign form ) .
3 late dy@@ sent@@ ers : in clinical studies that lasted one year or less , there was occasional reports about during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ingrad .
if with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , patients treated signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sent@@ ers should be drawn into consideration , to reduce the dose or to break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be depos@@ ed .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with sei@@ zu@@ res in the an@@ am@@ history or states that stand with sei@@ zu@@ res in connection with caution .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene in patients suffering from Alzheimer &apos;s disease associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , an elevated death of death in comparison to placebo .
there was , however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relation between the dosage and response to un@@ wanted zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events in treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related un@@ wanted events , with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally used in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar mania , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics in which weight gain as a side effect is observed and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advis@@ able when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole can be taken in combination with alcohol or other centr@@ alised medicines such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in a clinical study of healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole for 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore should be similar dose reductions .
at CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma cent@@ ages of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ ism .
if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefit should be considered potential risks for patients .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , must have similar effects and therefore should be similar dose reductions .
after setting up the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the Dos@@ age height prior to the esc@@ ort .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be used together with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day no significant effect on the metabolism of the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ mp@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ methodology morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ c ) .
the female should be advised to notify your doctor if pregnant , or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to inadequate data security for people and due to the concerns raised in the reproductive studies , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , the patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including automotive vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the above @-@ listed side effects is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study about 52 weeks in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total of lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ er@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ingrad , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study about 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients were treated with a placebo of 13.@@ 1 % in patients .
in a different long @-@ term study about 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol treatment .
in another study more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was diagnosed in patients with a resp@@ ec@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under Lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % were treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases the CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of treated patients treated with a placebo compared to 2.0 % treated with placebo .
in relation to the side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ingrad and sei@@ zu@@ res , un@@ wanted cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mortality rate in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ do@@ si@@ ations were observed in adult patients with estimated dos@@ ages of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths .
in fact , there are no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ og@@ sis in the treatment of an overdose is because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma connection .
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is communic@@ ated to the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- receptor and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity for d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4 , ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ gen and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H1@@ receptor .
in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy subjects showed a dos@@ ism depend@@ ant reducing the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the coup .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a half @-@ i@@ dol @-@ controlled study in Week 52 of the response of response to study employed in both groups were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measuring instruments which have been defined as secondary studies including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression scale , showed significantly stronger recovery than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction of the decline rate found at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % were below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients gain weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of about 5.6 kg .
in two placebo @-@ controlled physi@@ otherapy studies with more flexible dose over 3 weeks involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed up a placebo over 3 weeks against placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled physi@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ y and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a degree of placebo over a week 3 and an exhaus@@ tive effect which was comparable to the lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole noted in 12 a comparable proportion of patients suffering from symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of mania , such as lithium or semi @-@ i@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , which were partly over 2 weeks in therapeutic serum , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed a superior efficacy in reducing natural symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in certain patients who had achieved mar@@ gins with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to placebo was superior to placebo in regard to prevention of a bi@@ polar return , primarily in prevention of a decline in the mania .
based on in vitro studies , the CY@@ P3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzymes responsible for dehy@@ d@@ ration and hydro@@ xy@@ z@@ ole is cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination bracket is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole using Exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ ism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , equally among the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a popul@@ ar@@ isation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics revealed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic features of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study of subjects with different grave liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which does not suff@@ ice to draw weight on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , reproduction , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the potential potential , pre @-@ clinical data had no specific dangers for human beings .
Tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which have exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use .

it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is communic@@ ated to the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- receptor and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients gain weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of about 5.6 kg .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to inhal@@ ation of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to healthy volunteers was the ratio between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max value of the solution and value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ thermore , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the recommended clinical dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( which recommended 1 to 32 times the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rabbits , these effects were observed according to dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ ,000 of the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is used for rapid control of ag@@ ility and behavior in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate .
once clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to minim@@ ize the absorption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the mon@@ del@@ e@@ ide@@ us or deep in the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle under re@@ im@@ itation of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may vary depending on individual clinical status taking into account that have already been used to maintain or acute or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a more advanced treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see summary of the characteristics of the drugs to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y melting tablets or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution for inser@@ tion .
there are no studies on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients suffering from irrit@@ ability and behavi@@ oral disorders , which were different from schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ inen is additionally considered to be considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , the patients should be observed in extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on safety and effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not affected for patients with alcohol or pharmaceutical pois@@ oning ( by using the properly le@@ ashed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions used for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( dehy@@ d@@ ration ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies that lasted one year or less , there was occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ingrad .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle formation , changing consciousness and signs of autonomous in@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ ometer car@@ p , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally used in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar mania , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics in which weight gain as a side effect is observed and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ d@@ ation was greater compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in the healthy volunteers of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) that was intra@@ muscular in healthy volunteers ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H2 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites , the joint application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma cent@@ ages of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , must have similar effects and therefore should be similar dose reductions .
after setting up the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the Dos@@ age height prior to the esc@@ ort .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of se@@ d@@ ation was greater compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following side @-@ effects occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :

110 and Behavi@@ our Dis@@ orders had been associated with statistically significant improvements in A@@ gi@@ tier@@ ity / Behavi@@ or infections compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ ility and behavi@@ oral problems , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms regarding the gi@@ bility and behavi@@ oral problems compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
average improvement from the bas@@ eline value on the P@@ AN@@ SS excitement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5,8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe irrit@@ ability , a similar effectiveness was observed in terms of total population but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a half @-@ i@@ dol @-@ controlled study in Week 52 of the response of response to study employed in both groups were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measuring instruments which have been defined as secondary studies including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression scale , showed significantly stronger recovery than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction of the decline rate found at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % were below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients with weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of about 5.6 kg ) .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without mental characteristics , which were partly over 2 weeks not to lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed a superior efficacy in reducing natural symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study expansion in certain patients who had achieved mar@@ gins with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to placebo was superior to placebo in regard to prevention of a bi@@ polar return , primarily in prevention of a decline in the mania .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection 90 % larger the AU@@ C following gift of the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulas .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma samples at 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target plant in a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - or 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies for reproductive removal after intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns after maternal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rabbits ) was over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and c@@ ed@@ ural potential , pre @-@ clinical data had no specific dangers for human beings .
Tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which have exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure by man , so they only have limited or no significance for clinical use .
the effects revers@@ ed a dos@@ is@@ depend@@ ant side @-@ toxic@@ ity ( AU@@ C ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to the recommended maximum dose for humans ) and combined anc@@ ill@@ er@@ en@@ rin@@ gency @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at a recommended maximum dose of 10 mg / kg / day ( the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
in addition , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the recommended clinical dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( that recommended 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study that took part in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters were previously an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing drugs ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects ) .
in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) the 2@@ 29 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to the treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ containing medicines .
only patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer resulted in relation to efficacy dict@@ ators such as time until the deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
by contrast , in patients who had previously obtained other treatments in metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators , Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients , the breast@@ feeding or before the start of the treatment low neut@@ rop@@ hi@@ lic numbers in the blood .
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was in patients with which the first treatment was no more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing drugs and that it does not have to be given in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing other drugs to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited a approval for placing Abra@@ x@@ ane to the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease failed and not shown for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not shown ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ rop@@ hel@@ per count &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or heavier sens@@ ory re@@ rop@@ athy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
for sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy C@@ 3 the treatment is to be inter@@ rupt , up to degrees 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose custom@@ iz@@ ations in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies involving patients with affected cardi@@ oid function and there are currently no sufficient data on the recommendation of dose adjust@@ ments in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to un@@ sufficient data for un@@ question@@ able and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound Nan@@ op@@ ar@@ tic form@@ ul@@ ating from Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could be significantly different pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulas of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should immediately be removed and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be treated , and the patient must not again be treated with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients , no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , until the neutral number has risen again to &gt; 1,5 x 109 / l and increased the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ te number again &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 by UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly identi@@ fying Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been detected in connection with cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardiac inci@@ dents in the inde@@ xed patient collective were not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or under@@ lying heart disease or lung disease .
in case of patients suffering from Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diarrhea , these may be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ esis and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ous means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant or women with pregnant women , who do not practice an effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is indispensable .
women in a powerful age should be applied during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable placement method .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is stimul@@ ated , during and up to six months after treatment no child was witnesses .
male patients should be advised against treatment on sper@@ mac@@ a , since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very frequent ) and dizziness ( often ) , which can affect the traffic noise and the ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and main inci@@ dents of side effects listed in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer patients that were treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane once every three weeks .
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( 79 % of the patients reported ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ is@@ tically ; Leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 the side effects listed in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as a mon@@ otherapy occur at any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .

pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules that promotes the combination of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the Tub@@ ul@@ indi@@ ans and stabil@@ ised the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ oly@@ mers .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a inhibit@@ ing of the micro @-@ dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vit@@ ational inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s trans@@ ocy@@ to@@ sis of the endo@@ theli@@ al cells in the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies has been demonstrated that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in is promoting the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sit@@ omet@@ ry transportation is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ ous receptor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous Prot@@ eins SP@@ ARC ( sp@@ leen protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) occurs a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the field of tum@@ ors .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ blind , blind@@ ed studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III study study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer with Abra@@ x@@ ane was treated with a dose of 175 mg / m2 in the form of in@@ fusion .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ cent@@ ric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , either in the form of solv@@ ent @-@ hal@@ e pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 , a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had an adverse general state ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 Met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ ellen .
14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .

neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity versus pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who lived at a time during therapy for periph@@ eral neurop@@ athy &#91; 3 &#93; .
the natural course of periph@@ eral neurop@@ athy on bas@@ eline because of cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity by Abra@@ x@@ ane to &gt; 6 treatment courses were not evaluated and is still unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane to patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma cent@@ ration was taken in a multi@@ phase mode .
the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a vast ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or crossover links by pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic characteristics of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 abra@@ sion is compared with values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ gift higher ( 43 % ) as a solv@@ ent @-@ hal@@ ted pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissues is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily associated with 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 abra@@ sion in patients with metastatic breast cancer was 4 % of the total dose equivalent to less than 1 % of the total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance .
more than 75 years old , however , only few data are available , as only 3 patients in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis took part in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .

this means Ab@@ se@@ amed a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active substance ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference assistant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ effects , in which in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if before the procedure is not possible and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be run under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , which the medicine is displayed .
in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to refra@@ in from their own blood circulation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ene .
the injection can also be performed by the patient or of its support , provided that they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or patients who received chemotherapy should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per year of adults , respectively between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients have to be controlled in order to ensure that no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be given during the treatment .
in patients who received chemotherapy or patients with kidney problems , an an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel or by means that the body does not provide sufficient to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also applied to operations in order to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of a loss of blood .
it is produced by a cell that has been introduced into a gene ( DNA ) which it contributes to the formation of Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed has been compared to an injection in a v@@ ein in the context of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ emia with the reference surgeon .
all participating patients participating in this study was inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein before they were either converted to ab@@ se@@ amed or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main indicators for effectiveness was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the reporting period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also laid out the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin was inj@@ ected with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy alone .
in the study involving patients who suffered from kidney problems caused the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ al values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed , in the same degree as in those patients who continue to get E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to get E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / d@@ L of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , po@@ uring mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be applied in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa or any of other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as injec@@ tion under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this caused no allergic reactions .
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the medicine has been accomplished according to the rules of the European Union of evidence that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , the Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information on medical specialists in all Member States , including information on the security of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG an author@@ isation for placing of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union .

treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate angi@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; h@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mol / l &#93; , no iron deficiency , that demand a large blood flow rate ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
a reduction of foreign blood cells can be applied to adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion products can be expected .
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and a expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml that cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood flow program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7,5 m@@ mol / l ) , except for the patient concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) .
an@@ es@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms and fol@@ dings may vary depending on age , gender , and total disease of disease ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trial and disease resistance is required by the doctor .
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ins in order to be avoided by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in one patient or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mol / l ) should be reached .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month , or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose that is required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher levels of maintenance than patients with which the initial an@@ emia is less hard ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher levels of maintenance than patients with which the initial an@@ emia is less hard ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) .
starting dose 50 , / kg three times per week by intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose of 25 per kg ( three times per week ) until the target value is reached ( this should occur in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ es@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms and - subsequent publications can be different depending on age , gender , and total disease of disease ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trial and disease resistance is required by the doctor .
in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mol / l ) should be reached .
patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose that is required for control of an@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value , at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the reproduction rate has increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be retained by a dose of 150 - / kg three times a week or 450 / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the reproduction number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l has increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 ( / kg three times a week ) .
if after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 , / kg three times a week of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the reproduction species increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , should maintain the dose of 300 mg / kg three times a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the reproduction number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l over the initial value , a response to the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be broken .
patients with light an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , if the present storage of ≥ 4 blood vessels is needed , Ab@@ se@@ amed within a dose of 600 mg / kg body weight should receive twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
with the iron sub@@ stitution , as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood sp@@ ill program - started to provide large iron reserves before the beginning of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 mg / kg ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa , which should be given once a weekly about three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the date of intervention ( day 0 ) .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • O@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women and male men@@ opause .
it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ tional risk ( broken bones ) , including those who have suffered a s@@ trau@@ matic r@@ ump as they fell ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms of symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
to treat the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta is attracted to the rating of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved with o@@ steopor@@ osis and it was investigated the number of verteb@@ rate and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years , which recently had suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures were examined over a period of up to five years .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
main indicators for the effectiveness was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that ab@@ norm@@ alized bone sub@@ strate ) decreased in the blood again or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other o@@ steopor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ cine ) was reduced over a period of three years compared to placebo by 70 % .
compared to all patients suffering from A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other o@@ steopor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ cs ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a questionnaire ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients with placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be applied in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion of o@@ ste@@ o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis ( dying of bone tissue ) in the pine .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis , which contains information about the medicine , as well as the similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor .

treating o@@ steopor@@ osis • with post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic fra@@ ction .
for treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration is recommended to in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long run@@ off period was observed in patients receiving the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure that patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 , oral or intra@@ muscular intake of vitamin D is recommended before the first as@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the gift of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney function ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experiences for this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose of dose is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as data are missing for un@@ question@@ able and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al failure ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because of this patient population only limited clinical experiences .
an existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a therapy with sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid sett@@ ling of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid on bone structure a temporary , with symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure that patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
canc@@ ers , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be used before a dental surgery with appropriate preventive tooth treatment .
for patients who need dental access , no data are available if the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ aks in the ja@@ w area .
the clinical assessment by the treatment doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk evaluation .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the gift of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of adverse events reported cases of diagnosis was increased in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 51 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , Horizon - Rec@@ ur@@ rent frac@@ ture trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall incidence of mer@@ g@@ nosis was compar@@ atively similar between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ wanted drug effects are listed in table 1 .
kidney function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions that expressed as a decrease of kidney function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ at@@ ins ) and in rare cases of acute kidney failure .
the change of cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured before administration ) and kidney failure in a clinical study were comparable to o@@ steopor@@ osis in a clinical study about three years compared between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of the serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after the gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a versus 0.8 % treated with placebo in placebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory studies , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) were in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of treated patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus pa@@ get studies .
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures according to a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical frac@@ tures , the vitamin D levels were non @-@ rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the in@@ fusion position , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the ja@@ w region was involved , especially in cancer patients ( primarily in the ja@@ w region ) that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ ates , including c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including O@@ ste@@ omyel@@ itis , and the majority of reports rel@@ ates to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental crowns .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients represented o@@ ste@@ o@@ ek@@ sis in the ja@@ w area at one with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and a placebo @-@ treated patients .
in case of a transi@@ tional which leads to a clinical @-@ relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , can be obtained through the gift of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in treating post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been shown at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( BM@@ D ) -@@ t @-@ Score for 3 consecutive years ( BM@@ D ) or at least two light or a medium @-@ heavy existing verteb@@ rates , or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the scra@@ p mode of ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ rates .
effects on morph@@ ometric cycl@@ ists A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rates ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk for verteb@@ rates compared to placebo ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a hip frac@@ tures showed an equally lasting effect on three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of reduction of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar of lum@@ bar , hips and the dist@@ al radius compared to placebo @-@ treatment significantly ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine increased by 6.7 % , the total th@@ igh by 6.0 % , the th@@ igh as a result of 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology in 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es were taken from the pel@@ let .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to placebo an increase of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and receipt of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone sales mar@@ ker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly decreased by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured but the majority of the patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 , i.e. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) compared with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a group compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment compared to placebo @-@ treatment BM@@ D at the total th@@ igh and scra@@ pers at all ages .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment was carried out more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment for an increase in the BM@@ D by 5.4 % on the total th@@ igh and 4.3 % at the cup@@ board .
clinical efficacy in men In the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study were randomised and for 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction of clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures were 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in comparison to the weekly offering of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at relative to the percentage change of lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months did not under@@ place the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des Kno@@ ck A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was studied in patients and patients at the age of 30 with radi@@ ologically confirmed mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( middle serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2,@@ 6@@ fold up to 3,@@ 0@@ fold @-@ specific upper standard for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid compared to intake of 30 mg of frac@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months compar@@ ative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain relief was observed in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at for 6 months .
patients who were classified as a reminder on the end of the six @-@ month study ( on the therapy ) could be recorded in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , the therapeutic approach was able to treat patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared with 71 who treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients receiving an average duration of 18 months after application .
unique and multi@@ ples of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved dos@@ is@@ tically independent .
after this , the plasma seal increased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
quick @-@ phase disappearance of the major cycle with half @-@ days t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ hours of 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the af@@ ore@@ mentioned t ½ values ) probably represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the recommended dose is in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is ir@@ respective of a dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race , or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of zinc acid concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma cent@@ ration rate against time ) .
reduced Clear@@ ance by using cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzy@@ matic substances is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid is not metabolic , because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , fuel @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance , and amounted to 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
from this results that a light ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid require .
due to severe kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ standard intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies of dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C ) were administered at 6@@ times the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without any ren@@ al influence .
sub @-@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was administered as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose equivalent to approximately 6 times of human therapeutic exposure to AU@@ C , which corresponds to AU@@ C , equivalent to AU@@ C , equivalent to AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated applications , which exceeded the maximum of human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , and at the intraven@@ ous injection process .
the most common findings with repeated application was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ se of the long bones with animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a fertili@@ zation that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance .
in rats , there is a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ icity of doses ranging from 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such skel@@ et@@ ch@@ ets .
rabbits received no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects , although maternal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0,1 mg / kg due to resulting serum @-@ calcium levels .

July 2007 , completed on 29 September 2006 , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in module 1.@@ 8.1 and works in force before and will be marketed as the product .
Ris@@ ko management plan The owner of approval for placing on the market is committed to conduct the studies and the additional activities for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance based on the approval plan of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of author@@ isation application and all of the following CH@@ MP versions of the R@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP directive for Human Resources Management Systems , the revised R@@ MP was to be submitted together with the next &quot; peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
a rev@@ amped R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known to affect the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities for minim@@ izing the risk . • In half of 60 days , if an important milestone was achieved ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk of risk ) . • On request of the EMEA .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid is a representative of a sub@@ st@@ anz@@ class that is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ steopor@@ osis in men and the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone .
decre@@ asing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ rogen , formed by and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass that is observed in men .
when the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get takes place the bone structure is too fast , and new bone material is dis@@ assembled , which makes the bone material fain@@ ter than normal .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a appears , norm@@ alized the bone structure , norm@@ alizes a normal bone formation and therefore gives the bone once more strength .
if you are in dental treatment or need a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with other drugs please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or care staff if you have taken other medicines , use or used recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
for your doctor it is particularly important to know whether you use medicines , of which it is known to damage the kidneys .
when using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a together with food products and beverages , you are worried that you should take sufficient liquid for the instructions before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
o@@ steopor@@ osis The normal dose is 5 mg once a year , which is given to you by your doctor or care staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you recently have broken the hips , it is recommended to take the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip break .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is given to you by your doctor or care staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
since A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is effective for a long time , if necessary , you will need another dose only after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions , so that the calcium levels in your blood is not too low after in@@ fusion .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can do more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need another treatment .
if the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was missed , you will immediately get to agree with your doctor or hospital in order to make a new date .
before ending the treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a Falls , please take the treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , please feel true and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion are very frequent ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the following in@@ fu@@ sions .
fever and shi@@ vers , muscle , or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
currently it is un@@ clear if A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a causes this irregular heartbeat , but you should report to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
physical signs because of a low calcium concentration in blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or cra@@ w@@ ling or s@@ wap feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or pine were reported especially in patients who were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ ates because of other diseases .
allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , rash and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue , or throat ) was reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or care personnel if one of the listed side effects are significantly imp@@ aired or you may notice serious side effects that are not listed in this manual information .
if the medicine is not used directly , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions until the application ; usually 24 hours at 2 ° C should not be exceeded .
in patients with a short @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended to take the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a patients need to be sufficient with fluid ; this is particularly important for patients who receive di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid sett@@ ling of the effect of cy@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid on bone structure a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic can develop , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure adequate intake of calcium according to patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 , oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .

A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is used in addition to a diet and movement for the treatment of adult patients suffering from obesity ( body size index - BMI ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or that are overweight ( BMI of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition to one or more
moreover , four trials involving over 7 000 patients were carried out in which A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was employed in comparison to a placebo in support of smoking .
the studies on setting of smoking showed no uniform results so that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was hard to be assessed on this application area .
what risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA ? it is the most common side effects of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA , which were observed during the study ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tract . ng The complete list of treatment in connection with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA reported side effects is the package file .
it may not be used in patients that suffer from an existing depression or anti@@ depress@@ ants , since it can cause the risk of depression and caused by a small minority of patients su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European public report report ( EP@@ AR ) , explained as the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) to obtain recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
acet@@ one is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medication ) cannot be used together with other diabetes medicine ( dual therapy ) .
it can also be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) that can not be satisfactory in the highest toler@@ able dose alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ phi@@ l resin or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ substance or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ dening and insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin is better utili@@ zed and the blood sugar levels decreases , reducing type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ one in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ eme , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ ph@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value indicating that the blood glucose levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy trial , the effect of an additional gift from Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ates in a lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo resulted in a lowering of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study where the combination of acet@@ one and insulin was examined in 289 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin measures , compared with 0.@@ 14 % decrease in patients who took placebo in addition to placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were vision disorders , infections of the upper respiratory tract infections , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ ia ( dimin@@ ished sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ tos is not allowed to be applied in patients who may react sensi@@ tively to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ ones ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos in the context of a mon@@ otherapy ( in the sole use ) is intended to serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , where Met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a approval for placing of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the mar@@ ker &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ sufficient in@@ sufficient and in which metals is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compati@@ bly ( see section 4.4 ) .
for use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years no data is available , so the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed by the presence of a risk factor ( e.g. former heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treating the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ ede@@ ma , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ ular disease was carried out .
in this study , an increase in failure reports on heart failure , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver disease ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range increases , the liver enzy@@ mic values are as soon as possible to control .
if a patient develops symptoms that prove on a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nausea , vomiting , th@@ ron@@ y@@ ness , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark res@@ ins , are the liver enzyme values to check .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued until the presence of the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment should be conducted .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a dos@@ is@@ depend@@ ant weight gain has been proven , which can stir by grease deposits and in some cases linked with a fluid re@@ ten@@ tion .
as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction in the middle hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ins by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ins by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensi@@ tivity in patients who received pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ant or as twin @-@ combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dos@@ ing dependent hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
following the introduction of the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , was reported on a occurr@@ ence or deteri@@ oration of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct link between taking pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms when patients are reported about distur@@ ban@@ ces of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of messages undes@@ i@@ red events in randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on
the calculated fra@@ id incidence was 1.9 questionn@@ aires per 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one to be treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one for women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patients who were treated with compar@@ ative medication .
in the PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE study , a study about 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patients ) , compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patients ) in patients who were treated with compar@@ ative medication .
the patients should be aware of a pregnancy , and if a patient wants a pregnancy or entering this , the treatment is decre@@ asing ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on investig@@ ating the interaction have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one had no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with drugs which are registered by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium can@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ as@@ em@@ mer are not expected .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with the fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on to increase the 3 times .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is attributable to treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which reduces the hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance from the parent , thus reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates to the red@@ dish growth .
very frequent &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( from present data not inv@@ al@@ able ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the lens and the lens inde@@ xes , as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic active substances .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the three times the upper limit of the norm range is equally frequently due to placebo but more rarely than in compar@@ ative groups below met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ mac@@ eration .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease the frequency of a severe heart failure was 1.6 % higher than in placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is bz@@ ed .
since the market launch , it is rarely reported about heart failure in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on but more frequently if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in history .
a summary analysis of messages undes@@ i@@ red events in randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated in compar@@ ative groups treated in compar@@ ative groups .
in the period of 3.5 years current PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE study , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one patients compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with compar@@ ative medication .
when taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day were followed over seven days .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one appears to have a activation of specific core conception ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) which causes the animal model to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , grease and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral glu@@ cos@@ ess in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to examine the time up to the therapeutic efficacy ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the start of therapy , blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ sufficient for optimum phase with insulin in inadequate , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients who continue to get insulin ; Re@@ duc@@ ing the insulin injec@@ ting in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
in clinical trials over one year , there was a statistically significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ves compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week investigation on type 2 diabe@@ tic .
in most clinical trials , compared to placebo a total plasma tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel as well as minor , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one decreased compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d , the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel .
compared to placebo was not statistically significant increase in L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel while under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d was observed .
in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the postoperative tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , this also improved by an effect on the tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ d absorption and also on the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ glyc@@ eride synthesis .
in the PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease were random@@ ized to either existing anti @-@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy for a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is quickly absor@@ bent , with the top concentration of a fixed pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in the case usually 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the M @-@ IV contribution represents efficacy in about triple the efficacy of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction @-@ studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on had no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .

after oral use of radioactive mar@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans the mar@@ ker was found mainly in the f@@ ences ( 55 % ) and a lower extent in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ elimination period of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma cent@@ rations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function as low as healthy subjects , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance is quite similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies , in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , according to repeated administration , Plas@@ ma@@ volume aug@@ mentation , an@@ a@@ emia , re@@ versi@@ bler , expressed ex@@ cent@@ ric heart hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the parent , thus reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates to the red@@ dish growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( with male rats ) of the u@@ bl@@ um epi@@ theli@@ um induced .

in the PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE study , a study about 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patients ) , compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patients ) in patients who were treated with compar@@ ative medication .
in another study more than two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were examined .
in clinical trials over 1 year , there was a statistically significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ves compared to the initial values .
in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on did not only reduced the tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , but improved the postoperative tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , this has an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as on the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ d synthesis .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was tested in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is not able to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ ph@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks that shows how good blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c spi@@ der that hin@@ ts that the blood glucose levels were significantly reduced like with another human insulin .
acet@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied in patients who may react sensi@@ tively to human insulin ( allergic ) or any of the other constitu@@ ents .
furthermore , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may also be adjusted when it is administered along with a number of other drugs that can affect blood sugar ( the full list is the package file ) .
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was against the risks of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted a approval to the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for placing Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .

if the change of acet@@ ph@@ ane in patients is a dose custom@@ iz@@ able , this can be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after conversion .
some patients , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change of animal on human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling , the patient should go on several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his doctor , since such trips can lead to other times , or have to be taken in other times .
therefore , the doctor must consider possible inter@@ actions in the therapy and should always ask for others by them in other medicines .

Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may not be applied in patients , possibly sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other ingredients .
furthermore , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may have to be adjusted when it is administered along with a number of other drugs that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted a approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for placing Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of insulin has to be set up , then the amount of insulin is effective .
3 . when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in patients a dose adjustment is necessary , this may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after conversion .
before travelling , the patient should go on several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his doctor , since such trips can lead to other times , or have to be taken in other times .

the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum temperature is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration amounts to about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents , The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d was studied on a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and youth ( between the ages of 13 and 17 ) .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already shown evidence of cryst@@ alli@@ ances , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ gled no@@ des ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger urine cryst@@ alli@@ ances , which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the u@@ rea demand for two to four weeks is still over 6 mg per employee , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , still gyp@@ si@@ sts occur ; therefore , the patients may take at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic to take further drugs to the prevention of gyp@@ sy .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , at which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( spotlight ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( one other medicines for treating hypertension ) .
in the second study two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once a day 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of 300 mg every day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
main indicators for the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary tract infection was reduced to 6 mg / d@@ L during the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 out of 262 ) of the patients who posted aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once a day of 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 from 269 ) of patients who have once daily rated 120 mg for the last three measurements in the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ L .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients with placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diarrhea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , skin rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular in patients with heart failure in history , possibly an elevated risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Adenauer ac@@ ic acid in the blood was more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also increased risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ activity in diseases which have already led to urine deposits ( including one from the nurse known or current gre@@ ed clo@@ ds and / or of gre@@ ed@@ arthritis ) .
if the serum concentration of 2 @-@ 4 weeks is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) , a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 times can be considered daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , the efficacy and security has not yet been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents , when there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients .
organ transplan@@ ts as there is no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recei@@ vers , the use of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ emia heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure the treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other har@@ dening drugs , it may occur during treatment progress , because due to the lowering of the ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ aci@@ d@@ sp@@ aci@@ ation initially it can be mobili@@ zed in the tissue in the tissue .
B. with malign@@ ant illnesses and their treatment , len@@ tic@@ - ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of x@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases are so far reaching that it comes to an accumulation in the urine .
liver disease During the Phase 3 clinical trials were observed in cases of light elev@@ ations of the liver function at Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out before the beginning of the Feb@@ ux@@ i plant and in the further course according to clinical findings and a liver function ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was undertaken no inter@@ act studies on Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ing can result in an increase of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( inhibit@@ ing of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ) of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ or ) .
the simultaneous operation of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily was associated with a rise in Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ex@@ position ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / co@@ x @-@ 2 shirts were not in connection with an clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .

in a study of subjects with subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x found a medium 22 % increase in AU@@ C of des@@ i@@ pra@@ min , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which points to a possible weak @-@ like effect of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
Ant@@ azi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid which contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , the recording of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( by about 1 hour ) and a decline of C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C causes .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ ancies can not appear on side effects of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experiments do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious in the control of a vehicle , serve machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they cannot be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC can not affect their performance .
in comparison to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group reported in the overall market study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patients ) and in long @-@ term renewal studies ( 1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patients ) , although no statistically significant differences were found and no cog@@ correlation with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be found .
patients with risk factors were an arter@@ i@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the after@@ math .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) side effects associated with the medicine and in all Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at treatment units a total of more than once reported are listed below .
diar@@ rhoea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients that are simultaneously treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials , no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity actions were observed .
7 Open @-@ time extension studies In the open long @-@ term renewal studies were treated 906 patients up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years long and 53 patients were treated with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during the long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those that were reported in phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
in all February , the following treatment courses were reported in all February , and in patients who received Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with a exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 female patient years ) , according to information .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either either reported or reported in phase 3 for these cans or at a lower frequency :

active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the end product of Pur@@ pose Met@@ an@@ ism and arises as part of the reaction cas@@ cade of hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → u@@ bic acid .
Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is a real , non @-@ Pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ X@@ O ) with a Ki @-@ value for in vitro @-@ shirts , which is below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area .
clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was presented in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) that were carried out with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ activity and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point in each study was the proportion of patients with the last three monthly serum levels of &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 100 mg 1 x daily ( n = 108 ) , or Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum concentration start at the beginning of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 m@@ g. / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed statistically significant su@@ pre@@ macy of 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) , the statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
as a result , the F@@ ACT study showed statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 times a day as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual dose Al@@ lo@@ purple in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were collected for the analyses . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg .
the lowering of the serum concentration on &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) was observed during the physician attendance in week 2 and maintain all over the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 times daily ; 10 patients with serum values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 times daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ ditions to the AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function limit ( i.e. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached in 44 % ( 80 mg 1 times daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 times daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 times daily ) of the patients .
there were no clinical significant differences in the percentage process of serum concentration in patients , regardless of its kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ L &apos;E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ L .
the data collected in two years collected data from the open extension study of the phase 3 showed that the permanent lowering of the serum concentration on &lt; 6 mg / d@@ L ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) showed a decrease in the incidence of toxic@@ ity ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against de@@ fle@@ ction ) .
this was associated with a reduction of g@@ no@@ des size , which in 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of gre@@ ed notes up to the month of 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - Val@@ ues ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5,0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open @-@ term renewal studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plasma @-@ cent@@ re@@ rations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma cent@@ ric time curve ( AU@@ C ) by Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at after administration is simpler and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at a rise in AU@@ C which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after taking easier or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 times a day , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum concentration where this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at lies in the range of 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma cl@@ utch of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to around 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding on alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ scop@@ es shown that these oxid@@ ative metabolism are formed predominantly by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 and that Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ u@@ id is mainly created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mar@@ inated Feb@@ . ost@@ at found approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine as an un@@ modified Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabolism and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , about 45 % of the dose found in the chair as a un@@ altered Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of active substance ( 1 % ) , whose well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabolism and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ max of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to patients with normal kidney function .
the average total @-@ AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at took about the 1.8 times from 7.5 m g ( h / ml ) in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 m g ( h / ml ) in the group with severe kidney function .
12 liver function limit for taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC for patients with mild ( Ch@@ ild@@ - Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Classi@@ fication ) , change C@@ max and AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites were not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes in regard to AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC for older patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , Mut@@ agen@@ ese , Imp@@ air@@ ment of Fer@@ tility In Male rats , a statistically significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ors ( transi@@ tional cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dosed group , with 11 @-@ fold of exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ pose metabolic and urine composition , and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fer@@ til@@ ity and reproductive power of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were around 4 times the human therapeutic exposure , maternal toxic@@ ity arose , which went up with a lowering of inf@@ ancy and a development delay in the offspring of rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bone frag@@ ile ) is used in women after men@@ opause , in which a risk of low vitamin D levels exists .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the food , drink or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient is allowed to take up after the first food intake of the day , which should be done at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already being used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company laid data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also introduced a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , low ( 11 % ) than those who made exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data that included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , is exactly the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of movement apparatus ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of digestive devices such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( ul@@ cer@@ ations ) , ul@@ cers , diar@@ rhoea ( ul@@ cers ) , infl@@ ated ab@@ dom@@ es ( infl@@ ated stomach ) as well as su@@ ction .
in patients with persistent hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of the other components may not be used AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it may not be used in cases of es@@ oph@@ agus , patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low cal@@ ci@@ ary mirror ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit in at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or intake of drugs ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin additional supplements ) for the day .
the following references are precisely to be found to reduce the risk of ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is supposed to be swallowed up only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or the tablet in the mouth , as a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a exists . • The patients should not take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ edings or surgical interventions in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , only under special attention ( see section 4.3 ) .
Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ ale reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ oms , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Stri@@ c@@ tures were reported in patients under the taking of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly they were severe and required a hospital assignment ) .
the doctor is therefore attentive to hin@@ der all signs and symptoms that are hin@@ dered on possible ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ st@@ ern@@ al pain or new or dis@@ lim@@ mer@@ sible so@@ d@@ burn the drug and collect medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of serious serious side effects seems to be increased in patients that do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms that refer to an ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dos@@ ing instructions are passed on patients and understood from the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while clinical trials with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at had no increased risk , rarely ( after market release ) Mag@@ ical and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some severe and associated with complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) .
o@@ ste@@ o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis of the ja@@ w , usually in connection with a tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including O@@ ste@@ omyel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment could predominantly be intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously .
there are no data available to determine whether the placing of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ al therapy in patients who need a ja@@ w surgical procedure to dimin@@ ish the risk of o@@ ste@@ o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis of a pine .
the clinical assessment by the treatment doctor is crucial for treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk evaluation .
the patients should be instructed to take the dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE dose to take the tablet in the next morning after having noticed their sow .
you should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking the taking of one tablet per week as originally planned at the fore@@ seen day of the week .
other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before the start of the therapy .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate food and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , the patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at for at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific intervention studies were not performed , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical trials jointly with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs , without clinical relevant interaction .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither recommended during pregnancy nor breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at cannot do any indication of dam@@ aging effects in regard to the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
o@@ ste@@ o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis of the ja@@ w was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ ates ; most reports come from cancer patients , but also reported in O@@ steopor@@ os@@ ep@@ ati@@ ent .
nonetheless , the serum samples were up to &lt; 8.0 mg / l ( 2.0 m@@ mol / l ) and the serum concentration of up to ≤ 2.0 m@@ mol / l ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mol / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .

in o@@ steopor@@ osis , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects , the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) did not lead to any clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .

Ad@@ vag@@ raf is administered by adult patients whose kidney or liver transplan@@ ts to prevent transplan@@ ting of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft is already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with programme / programme and data published in the published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney disease transplan@@ t , with the use of Ad@@ cam@@ raf with programming or programming or c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
main indicators of efficacy was the number of patients where the gra@@ ft was canc@@ eled after a period of treatment ( for example , as often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , more recent studies have been carried out in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and examined how Ad@@ cam@@ raf is included in comparison to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft from the body .
tre@@ mor ( tre@@ mor ) , headache , nausea / vomiting , diarrhea ( diar@@ rhoea ) , kidney problems , increased potassium content of blood ( hyper@@ glyc@@ emia ) , hypertension ( hypertension ) as well as sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( insom@@ nia ) .
in patients with persistent hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , mac@@ ular antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other ingredients may not be applied .
patients and doctors have to be careful if others ( especially some herbal ) medicines at the same time are taken with Ad@@ ults , since the Ad@@ ult dose or the dose of the drug may be adapted accordingly .

only doctors , who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ful therapy and treatment of transplan@@ tations , should disp@@ ose this drug or take changes in immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ful therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the System@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transplan@@ ts or to increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; Modification of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the eng@@ aging control of one in the transplan@@ tation paper ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in a result of conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjust@@ ments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dose of Ad@@ ults should be primarily based on clinical assessment of adju@@ sting and toler@@ ability in individual cases and blood @-@ level regulations ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from programming to Ad@@ vag@@ raf the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talks should be controlled from the change@@ over and over two weeks to conversion .
in day 4 , the systemic exposure was measured as a mirror , with both for@@ ging both in kidney @-@ and @-@ transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ es are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Ad@@ vag@@ raf to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate after@@ math phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Ad@@ cam@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ Schem@@ as may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition is not permitted in the first postoperative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml Con@@ cent@@ rate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) can be conducted at a dose of ca .
duration of the application for the supp@@ ression of the transplan@@ tation must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy is not specified .
dose recommendations - kidney failure proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ fts using the oral no@@ vaginal therapy should start with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift to the morning .
other dose custom@@ iz@@ ations may be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patients after the transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ fts using the or@@ ale Ad@@ vag@@ raf therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift to the morning .
dose recommendation - conversion of programming on Ad@@ vag@@ raf must have a gra@@ ft dose of twice daily dose of Progra@@ me capsules to one once daily intake of Ad@@ ults , this change@@ over in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t After a change@@ over of other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants on Ad@@ vag@@ raf each day , treatment with the recommended initial initial dose for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ ting slip is to begin .
transplan@@ t In adult patients who are converted to Ad@@ cam@@ raf is an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day a day in the morning .
other gra@@ fts did not have any clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ raf at lung , pan@@ kre@@ as@@ - and intestinal patients , patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and at intestinal transplan@@ t recei@@ vers in a oral initial dose of 0,3 mg / kg / day and at intestinal transplan@@ t recei@@ vers in a oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose custom@@ iz@@ ations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood levels in targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver function as a result of the dose required .
patients with reduced kidney function Since kidney function do not influence the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it may be assumed that a dose of dose is not necessary .
due to ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of the serum levels ) is recommended , a calculation of cre@@ atine and monitoring of the body volume ) .
conversion of c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vag@@ raf At the conversion of a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in on a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advis@@ able ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the valley mirror in the whole blood : the dose should be primarily based on clinical assessment of output and toler@@ ability in individual case using full @-@ blood cl@@ erg@@ o @-@ mirror controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talks during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also change according to conversion of programming to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ ization , changes of immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ful therapy or even in the same use of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ cam@@ raf has a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , adap@@ tations of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical trials make it possible that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the valley mirror does not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice the valley mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us lies in the whole blood in the first time according to liver transplan@@ ts in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in ad@@ ren@@ al and heart transplan@@ t patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent heating therapy of liver , kidney , and heart transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including transplan@@ ts or other side @-@ effects , which can appear in a row of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ ex@@ position .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes in formulation or regime should only be performed under the eng@@ aging control of one in the transplan@@ tation paper ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft shock absor@@ bing , which has been proven to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , yet there are no clinical data for ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation of Ad@@ ults .
for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ fts at adult heart gra@@ fts and gra@@ ft recipi@@ ents in childhood memories are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
due to possible inter@@ actions that may lead to a degra@@ dation of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a we@@ aker of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements , the St John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is included , or other plant@@ ings during a treatment with Ad@@ ults ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rhoea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood is offered where the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , it was considered a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy described chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e , which can therefore also be found under Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are an existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver disorders , infections , fluid load and oils .
as with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin changes caused by suitable clothing or use of a solar protection .
when patients take the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for Pre@@ s such as headache , change consciousness state , con@@ vul@@ sions and bl@@ ur@@ inal disorders should show a radi@@ ographic examination ( e.@@ g .

the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicinal products known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and reduce the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood mirror with the same gift of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and therefore represent the tac@@ o dose to maintaining even higher concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a highly pronounced interaction was used with tim@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ic such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and Vor@@ os@@ ac@@ ol , and with the Macro@@ eyel@@ id antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ em@@ akers ( z .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the rise in blood levels mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by inhibit@@ ing gastro@@ intestinal degra@@ dation .
high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute removal actions , can increase the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; hence the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines which are used by CY@@ P3@@ A4 , whose metabolism is affected .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us put down the Clear@@ ance of Ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive a and thus increase the hormon@@ al ex@@ position , it is particularly cau@@ tious when decisions on recep@@ tive measures are particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on , and extend their half @-@ value days .
the results of a minor number of tests on transplan@@ tations provide no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , an increased risk for un@@ wanted events in regard to the course and result of pregnancy .
in u@@ ter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the new@@ bor@@ ns may commen@@ ce on possible adverse effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( in particular regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases like the most highly effective immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants is treated in patients that are treated with tactics for infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , prot@@ o@@ zo@@ ale ) .
cases of BK @-@ virus @-@ related N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated with advanced multi@@ focal leu@@ co@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Ad@@ ults .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant Ne@@ op@@ last@@ y including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymph@@ opro@@ lifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours in conjunction with the treatment of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high bond of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ zed .
the effect of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level must be convey@@ ed through the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular nucle@@ us .

published results of the primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the form of twice daily used programme Progra@@ f has developed into a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ant according to pancre@@ as , lung and intestinal transplan@@ tations .
175 % of the patients were subjected to a pancre@@ atic transplan@@ t in 4@@ 75 patients and deployed in 630 cases after an intestinal transplan@@ t as primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall , the safety profile of oral programming in these published studies gave the observations into the major studies where programming in liver , kidney and cardiac transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents were applied to the primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression .
lung transplan@@ tation In a intermediate analysis of a recent survey , multi @-@ center study with oral programming has been reported on 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 Rand@@ om@@ ization .
chronic gra@@ ft damage , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis inc@@ iter@@ ative syndrome , was less frequently observed in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.4 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .

the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly bigger ( p = 0.0@@ 2 ) than the number of patients who were given by Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases in which there came to no acute transplan@@ ting was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) , patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study the frequency of emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis is inc@@ iter@@ ative , among the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us patients was significantly lower .
a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study with oral programming has been carried out on 205 patients simultaneously , which had been carried out simultaneously a pan@@ kre@@ as@@ - and kidney transplan@@ tation that were received after a random@@ ized process Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was later reached to reach the stri@@ cken valley mirror of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
intestinal transplan@@ tation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centr@@ alised study of oral transplan@@ ts showed at 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ tations ) under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for early identi@@ fying Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ tial aug@@ mentation , lower initial doses of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , which lead to tal@@ es between 10 and 15 ng / ml and the latest gra@@ ft radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) .
factors such as a low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rate value and low protein concentrations , leading to an increase in the in@@ bound faction of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or due to treatment with cor@@ tis@@ ko@@ ster@@ oids are to be responsible for the increasing higher Clear@@ ance rates following the transplan@@ tation .
this makes it possible that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely metabolic before the ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly carried out on the bile .
in stable patients receiving programs ( twice daily ) at Ad@@ ults ( once daily ) at Ad@@ ults ( 1 : mg : mg ) , the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was reduced to almost 10 % lower than under programming .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talks during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ tation , which proved to be treated with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , yet there are no clinical data for ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation of Ad@@ ults .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are an existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver disorders , infections , fluid load and oils .

advances will be used to treat bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a defect caused by the lack of factor VIII ) .
dosage and frequency of application be treated , whether it is applied to the treatment of bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical intervention .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood co@@ ag@@ ulation problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) introduced it to the formation of human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII .
Adv@@ ant@@ ages are approved by another in the European Union called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but it is otherwise manufactured , so the drug contains no animal protein and animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe and severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine was studied in the prevention of bleeding and surgical intervention .
in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ations in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood cl@@ sep@@ iso@@ des with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; assessed .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ant@@ ages ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are dizziness , head@@ aches , Py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ant@@ ages may not be applied in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or one of other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG approval for introducing Adv@@ ances to the entire European Union .
dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitu@@ ion therapy are al@@ igned with the sever@@ ity of factor VIII @-@ deficiency , after the place and the extent of blood flow and clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , factor VIII activity should not drop under the given plasma seal ( in % of the norm or in i.e. , / d@@ L ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) to repeat 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are eliminated .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk is over .
during treatment , to control the dose of the dose and incidence of injec@@ tions an adequate determination of factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ m@@ Acc@@ eler@@ ates .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and show different half @-@ value times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. factor VIII per kg of body weight during 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not ruled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out if necessary to detect a inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic interventions must be sufficient .
the administration speed should be addressed after the patient &apos;s desire , whereby a maximum injection of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alising antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complications of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) pro ml plasma by modified Beth@@ es@@ da ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk is dependent on the biggest 20 ex@@ position days and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ position and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ory development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , re@@ occur from ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurr@@ ence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences about factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding .
the A@@ DR@@ s in the largest number of patients suffering from factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who had previously untreated patients that have increased risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not inv@@ al@@ u@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of individual patients ( 234 ) . ( b ) The unexpected drop of the blood stream factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 @-@ 14 post @-@ operative day ) in one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation was maintained during the whole time and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed adequate values on the 15th post @-@ operative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavier hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , there was none of the 53 p@@ ä@@ atric patients with an age of 6 years and diagnosed heavier hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) following previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or observed .
in the previously untreated clinical trial , 5 of 25 patients ( 20 % ) treated patients with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients to factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of contam@@ inated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend towards anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise no symptoms or symptoms , which referred to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients agreed on the occurr@@ ence of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of os@@ oph@@ in@@ ophi@@ lic gren@@ u@@ lo@@ tes in several re@@ peti@@ tive product positions in the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , allergic reactions were reported using an allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency un@@ known ) .
the activated factor VIII is a C@@ of@@ actor factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X out of factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were carried out in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( basis value factor VIII @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were obtained from a cross @-@ over trial with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 listed below .

based on the data for the first time , the CH@@ MP has also been reviewed the benefit risk provisions as a positive , but in consideration that the safety profile may be closely monitored for following reasons :
therefore , CH@@ MP is based on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes an submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the registration owner has to apply for another 5 years further extension .
in December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited adopted the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company rec@@ eded its application for the placing of Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , bones or soft parts ( tissues , the other structures in the body connects , surro@@ unds and backs ) of them .
this is a type of virus , which has been genetically modified , that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ovirus &quot; that has changed so that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore no infection can trigger in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ changes should be inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and enable the cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced by the un@@ defective in the human body have an existing p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to the restoration damage DNA and to kill the cells , if the DNA cannot be restored .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer with which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company laid data from a study in a patient with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of under@@ building , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers to the questions concerning him , some questions were un@@ explained .
based on the evaluation of the initial documents , CH@@ MP was created on Day 120 , a list of questions which is sent to the company .
according to CH@@ MP opinion not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ changes in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors offer advantages for the patient .
the committee also had concerns relating to the processing of medicine in the body , the type of administration and the security of the drug .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ changes can be made in reliable ways , and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in en@@ rich contact with the patient , harmful .
the company did not know the CH@@ MP to know whether the withdrawal for patients who are currently in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; modified active release &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components immediately and the other slowly released over a few hours .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever , through an allergy to p@@ ollen caused by in@@ od@@ or inflammation of the nose ) in patients with nose drop@@ let ( c@@ logged nose ) .

the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and end , once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the medicine can be found on con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main actual measurements were the changes in the gravity of the hay fever symptoms that were reported from the patients prior to treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients showed their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard sc@@ ala , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
considering all of the hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s income , compared with a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who are p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients below Aer@@ in@@ aze showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who received dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , t@@ ach@@ on@@ eness , dizziness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( loss of appetite ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , insom@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be applied to patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other ingredients , to ad@@ ren@@ er@@ ous agents or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) are not used .
Aer@@ in@@ aze can also be applied in patients that suffer from a bott@@ len@@ tic@@ ular glaucoma ( high blood pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ roid ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ roid disease ) , or already having a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a brain bleeding ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted SP Europe auth@@ orization to launch an Aer@@ in@@ aze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , to swal@@ low a whole ( i.e. without them to cr@@ ush or ch@@ ew ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should be applied to children under the age of 12 due to the failure of data for un@@ question@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after des@@ ks of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , because in long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can be removed .
depending on the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory system , treatment with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , the drug is also contra@@ indicated in patients that are treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or and within 2 weeks after the completion of such therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity of combined use of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ es such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ eg@@ i@@ amin , o@@ lig@@ amine , o@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ ot@@ amine or other decre@@ on@@ tiv@@ a , phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , oxy@@ gen@@ olin , nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient collective , and the data is not enough to address appropriate recommendations .
safety and the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function , and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate recommendations .
the patients must be informed of that treatment in the occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ ton@@ ia or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ at or pit@@ ations , heart rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea , or any other neurological symptoms ( such as headache or gain of head@@ aches ) must be removed .
the treatment of the following patient groups is advised to be careful : • Pati@@ ents under digital disease • Pati@@ ents with ar@@ rhyth@@ ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the history of history , diabetes mell@@ itus , bladder hal@@ so@@ b@@ um , or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus in the history of history .
Aer@@ in@@ aze can prevent at least 48 hours before the implementation of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , because Anti@@ hist@@ amine tend to prevent positive reactions on indicators for skin reaction or in their mag@@ nit@@ ude .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given , however , no clinical relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma cent@@ ration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed .
for the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests did not have any significant differences between those treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and placebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone or with alcohol was taken .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not been identified yet , so that interaction with other drugs can not be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P3@@ A4 not , and in vitro studies have shown that the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 product is not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the in@@ conc@@ ub@@ ility of the use of Aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency in normal population .
since reproductive studies in animals are not always transferred to humans and due to vas@@ o@@ con@@ ical characteristics of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied in the pregnancy .
however , the patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases it may come to a drow@@ sin@@ ess , which can lead to an imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic noise or the ability to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , heart @-@ circulation ) and a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation ( insom@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ als .

a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation is especially likely in children as well as at@@ roph@@ y @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth drying , pup@@ il sti@@ ff and di@@ lat@@ ation , skin ery@@ thema , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the inhibit@@ or of the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ oph@@ ile as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the adolesc@@ ence P @-@ sel@@ ess on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of flu@@ x , including rein@@ forcement of sub@@ jec@@ tivity or the tasks that are connected to flies .
in controlled clinical trials , at recommended dose of 5 mg , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was detected compared to placebo .
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dial or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S exc@@ itation .
in the age of 12 and 78 patients with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis took part in the age of 4@@ 14 patients with Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine @-@ agon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , determined by the total score for the symp@@ tom ( except s@@ cent@@ ric mu@@ til@@ ation ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine above the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets in terms of weak@@ ening effect , determined using the nas@@ al s@@ cent@@ ric mu@@ til@@ ation , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine on the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ aze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached in day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ is@@ study that was carried out with the formulation as tablet to healthy adult subjects was found that four volunteers dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine badly mis@@ used .
a components of inter@@ act study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole gift of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in bio@@ equivalent was exposure to the gift of an Aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity , toxic@@ ity , and reproduction systems , pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may have no particular dangers for human beings .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally consistent with the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .
in reproductive @-@ based studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was administered in the oral gift to rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
since March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 , the author@@ isation application is established and works and works , before and while the product is based on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to alle@@ vi@@ ating allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance that can un@@ fold its effect .
Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets re@@ lie@@ ve symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever ) , such as riv@@ ets , ongoing or ju@@ ck@@ ling nose , or l@@ ashing eyes with simultaneous con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .

it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 M@@ g@@ - ly@@ cop@@ is@@ at for inhal@@ ing ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 m@@ g. and 5 mg melt tablets ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for inser@@ tion .
for children aged up to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or between .
for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml syrup or adults .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
the efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of add@@ ling , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and efficiency ) before and after six @-@ week treatment was determined .
there were further studies presented to prove that the body uses the syrup , the solution to inhal@@ ing and the melting tablets in the same manner as the tablets and the use of children un@@ think@@ able .
allergic rhin@@ itis took place when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease of the symptoms of 12 to 26 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of the symp@@ tom took to six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % compared to placebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , or one of other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted SP Europe approval for placing A@@ eri@@ us to the European Union .
one tablet once daily , with a or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials for the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease and can end after the end of the symptoms and resum@@ ed in their res@@ ent@@ ment .
in the per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended for a constant treatment during allergies .
clin@@ ically relevant interaction were not found in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol consumed the effective effect of alcohol ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
however , the patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases it may occur in very rare cases , which can lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic light or the ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events that were reported more frequently than the placebo was drow@@ sin@@ ess ( 1,2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse event was headache , these stood at 5.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.9 % of the patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were given , no clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ oph@@ ile as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the adolesc@@ ence P @-@ sel@@ ess on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
as part of a clinical study with multiple outlets , in the distill@@ at@@ ad@@ ine at a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. daily administered over 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in a single dos@@ ing study , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of flu@@ x , including rein@@ forcement of sub@@ jec@@ tivity or the tasks that are connected to flies .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in treating the symptoms such as kidney , no@@ stri@@ ls and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ it@@ ence , and redness of the eyes , as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification of sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown by the total score of the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces in@@ seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria has been as@@ certain@@ ed for further forms of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , since the under@@ lying path@@ ophysi@@ ology has been identified regardless of the eti@@ ology in different forms and chronic patients can be recruited .
since the hist@@ amine is an active factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is also expected to improve symptoms in other forms of Ur@@ tic@@ aria in other forms of Ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and lowering size and number of portions at the end of the first dose .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of the patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ amine from the study .
improvement of the skin irrit@@ ation by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine patients compared to 19 % treated patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wax significant , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluation of these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patients were comparable with the general seasonal rhin@@ itis -@@ population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no monitoring points for a clinical @-@ relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily application of DES@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days ahead .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is still not identified , so that interaction with other drugs are not completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine un@@ inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 6 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 product is not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ is@@ study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) does not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
the clinical trials performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin who showed a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative differences in terms of toxic@@ ity profiles of DES@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ produc@@ tion@@ x@@ iz@@ ity , pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may not recognise special dangers for human beings .

A@@ eri@@ us may be taken independently of meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ating the symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
the missing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see under Section 4.4 ) and that there are no data , which support a treatment of infectious rhin@@ itis in A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ic anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis , physical examination , and appropriate laboratory and laboratory studies should play a role in diagnosis .
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years on den@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine limited and experienced a higher frequency load ( see under section 5.2 ) .
the safety of as@@ eri@@ us syrup in children between 2 and 11 years , the restricted metabolic rate is identical to children that are normally metabolic .
this drug contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ cro@@ se @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interaction were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets which were given to ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol consumed the effective effect of alcohol ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
overall incidence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as compared to the placebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , who were given up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years , who came to an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ indo@@ or@@ sis of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults can extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg used daily for over 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ phar@@ ma @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg per day ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was detected compared to placebo .
for a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets performed surgery in adults and adolescents in clinical trials for no imp@@ air@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies of adults , it was caused by the simultaneous intake of alcohol not to a ampli@@ fication of alcohol induced resistance to an increase of drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in treating the symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , no@@ stri@@ ls and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear @-@ flu@@ ence , and redness of the eyes , as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown by the total score of the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets are effectively caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and lowering size and number of portions at the end of the first dose .
the prolifer@@ ation of this fully metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ c@@ asian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ l@@ ul@@ ating children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , which are limited to metabolic disorders .
strain ( AU@@ C ) by des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was about 6@@ times higher and the C@@ max is about 3 to 4 times higher with a season half @-@ value of about 120 hours .
there are no monitoring points for a clinical @-@ relevant drug cum@@ ulation after once daily use of DES@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine used in p@@ ä@@ atric patients at the recommended doses were comparable to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine syrup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is still not identified , so that interaction with other drugs can not be excluded .
A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up is offered in type III Bra@@ ung@@ las@@ agna with child @-@ safe polypropylene @-@ finishing kit with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at once daily put in the mouth to alle@@ vi@@ ating the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster needs to be carefully opened and the dose of the Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ats have to be taken without damage .
clin@@ ically relevant interaction were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets which were also used with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , at the recommended dose of 5 mg , 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets were reported when patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , used up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at became well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vit@@ al@@ marks and EC@@ G interval data .
as part of a clinical study with multiple outlets , in the distill@@ at@@ ad@@ ine at a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day has been applied every day over 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .

in June 2008 , Novartis V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. is officially distributed to the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) to prevent approval for the placing of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov on the prevention of the avi@@ ar H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu , which is caused by the flu virus ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine , which might cause a strain of influenza virus , which might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic to protect .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of influenza virus appears easily by human being able to spread human beings , because humans still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the influenza virus , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; physically alien@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the immune system is able to form a rapid antibody in contact with a flu virus of this Stam@@ ina .
subsequently the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as a body @-@ foreign ) , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine .
an inspection of some of the study participants showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
thus , the scope of clinical data base for evalu@@ ating security of the vaccine does not suff@@ ice to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA for pre @-@ pan@@ dem@@ ic vaccines .
should you participate in a clinical examination and further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor doctor .

it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years which are caused by human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can &apos;t swal@@ low the capsules are available as a solution for inser@@ tion , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ cavi@@ ar as the safety of this combination was not investigated .
the medication should then be prescribed if the doctor has tested the anti@@ viral medication of the patient previously used , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood judged that the virus will address the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with 100 mg of k@@ nights and other anti@@ viral medicines twice daily .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of car@@ pent@@ ase is set up after body weight .
ag@@ itation decreased in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV amount in the blood and holds them at a low level .
AIDS does not cure diseases , however , damage the immune system and thus contributes to the development of HIV @-@ related infections and diseases .
ag@@ rot@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without k@@ nights , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously been treated with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ em@@ akers .
this with low dose of ph@@ on@@ cavi@@ r increased drug A@@ zo@@ ase was compared with 206 adults , who had previously taken prot@@ e@@ as@@ ure inhibit@@ or , with other protagon@@ ists .
main indicators for effectiveness was the proportion of patients with not det@@ ectable levels of HIV in blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
in the studies involving patients who had previously not taken prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase inhibit@@ or , had a viral load below 400 copies / ml than under Placebo , but A@@ pr@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase had also been the vir@@ us@@ last , but with the children who were previously treated with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ em@@ akers , only few of them spoke to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ em@@ akers , the viral load of the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment is just as effective as other protagon@@ ists :
in the patients suffering from HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ure inhibit@@ or , it was under A@@ zo@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks than in the patients receiving their previous prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase inhibit@@ or :
the most common side effects of ag@@ ony ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) , headache , diar@@ rhoea ( diar@@ rhoea ) , ro@@ sea ( nausea ) , vomiting , skin rash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 ag@@ itation must not be applied in patients that may be in@@ sensitive to am@@ b@@ abo@@ r or one of other components .
A@@ ag@@ ase should also be applied in patients , the St John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement to treat depression ) or pharmac@@ euticals , which are equally to be shed and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood health .
as with other medicines for HIV , in patients who are receiving ag@@ ra@@ ase , the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an o@@ ste@@ o@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ( symptoms of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ ological activation syn@@ dro@@ sis ( symptoms of infection that are caused by the immune system ) .
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of ag@@ itate in use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children were over four years compared to the risks .
ag@@ rot@@ ase is generally taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amp@@ lif@@ tic amp@@ lif@@ iers , but the committee set that the benefit of car@@ ri@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ e@@ as@@ ure inhibit@@ or .
ag@@ rot@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; as at the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a approval for placing an A@@ lev@@ ase in the entire European Union .
ag@@ rot@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ em@@ mer ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ destined adults and children from 4 years onwards .
for usually A@@ generic capsules are to be given to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic p@@ adding of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r together with low doses of rite cavi@@ ar ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r as a solution for inser@@ tion is 14 % lower than one capsule ; therefore , ag@@ gregate capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for ag@@ ra@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ b@@ abo@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg of k@@ nights twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If ag@@ ra@@ ase capsules are applied without the enh@@ ancing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ bs ) , higher doses have to be applied on ar@@ ra@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for ag@@ ra@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ b@@ abo@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg am@@ b@@ abo@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , effectiveness and safety of ag@@ ra@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other protagon@@ ists were not examined in children .
ai@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under the age of 4 , due to the failure of data for un@@ question@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of ag@@ ra@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily , and patients with severe liver function to be reduced to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous application of patients with mild or moderate liver function should be treated with caution while patients with severe liver function is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
ag@@ itation must not be given at the same time using medicines which have a small therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable preparations , the St John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma cent@@ rations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r during intake of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that aging or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy are not leading to cure HIV infection and that they continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including the treatment of hydro@@ gen@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
generally , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C are treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , an increased risk of liver inter@@ actions with potentially fatal course .
for the case of an anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the information about this medicine .
patients with existing liver function including an chron@@ ically active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of hydro@@ gen@@ ase and k@@ ron@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glucose accumulation is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of treatment the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and supple@@ ment@@ ation of the tribut@@ ary function weighs ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the degra@@ dation of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly recommended by CY@@ P3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of hydro@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended for increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , methods are available to determine the substance concentration .
in patients that take this medicine at the same time , ag@@ rot@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma seal of ammon@@ b@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tive can be changed , however , the information is not sufficiently sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ at@@ rous symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity , due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution by certain other patient groups .
ag@@ rot@@ ase should be removed in length 5 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including Prot@@ e@@ as@@ em@@ mer , was reported on the occurr@@ ence of diabetes mell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an ex@@ az@@ ure of an existing type of diabetes mell@@ itus .

at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opport@@ un@@ istic infection that leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi @-@ fac@@ t@@ orial eti@@ ology is accepted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ o@@ ek@@ ar@@ sis reported in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of ag@@ itate cannot be given at the same time using medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width al@@ ar@@ ra@@ r must not be given together with drugs , whose active ingredients are primarily associated with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ rology and lead to a resistance development .
in the attempt to compens@@ ate the lower plasma level by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently un@@ wanted effects on the liver were observed .
St John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r can be humili@@ ated through the simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with St John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ bition are up mirror and , if possible , to check the viral load and lose the St John &apos;s wort .
a dose @-@ adjustment for one of the medicine is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( see also ec@@ lipse below ) .
508 % increases , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r used twice daily and k@@ nights of 100 mg twice daily , which prove the effectiveness and integrity of this treatment schemes .
52 % humili@@ ated if Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ viol@@ r + 100 mg of k@@ nights twice daily ) was given .
the C@@ min values of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r in plasma , which were achieved during the combination of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg ch@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ nights .
a recommended dosage for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended a close monitoring , as the effectiveness and un@@ think@@ able this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study used in combination with di@@ dan@@ o in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , because of the ant@@ acid component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in is advised that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and ag@@ itate to lie at least one hour ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
therefore , there is no dose custom@@ iz@@ able in combination with am@@ id@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
the treatment with ec@@ om@@ int@@ ment in combination with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ viol@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ em@@ akers would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other prot@@ e@@ as@@ em@@ mer and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin may possibly sink the serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r .
if this drug should be used simultaneously , caution is advis@@ able since del@@ av@@ ir@@ d could be less effective because of the reduced and possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level .
if this medicine be applied together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rology surveillance should be performed as an exact forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and k@@ nights on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous production of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the plasma cent@@ ration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin for 193 % and thus increasing the side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is required along with as@@ gener@@ ase , to reduce the dose of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is prescribed .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ certain@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma level of both drugs could be increased in the same administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ou@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day resulted in an increase of C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and AU@@ C ( 0 % ) compared to the value which was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , if they are used together with car@@ ri@@ ase , possibly lead to inter@@ actions .
these patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions that are associated with these drugs , if they are used in combination with ar@@ ase .
based on the data from other protagon@@ ists , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ acids should not be taken at the same time as ag@@ ra@@ ase , since it may come to resignation problems .
simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va known as an enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ b@@ ep@@ r can lead to a detection of the plasma seal of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r .
serum concentration of calcium channel blocks such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ fi@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ pin , ni@@ fi@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ pin and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by am@@ b@@ abo@@ r which may be increased by activity and toxic@@ ity of this drug .
the simultaneous operation with as@@ certain@@ ties can increase considerably and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection side effects including hyp@@ oten@@ sion , vision disorders , and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) were significantly increased over 7 days , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol had decreased about 86 % ( 90 % account interval 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous gift of aging with Rit@@ on@@ cavi@@ r is not recommended together with these Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ rho@@ ids , unless the benefit of a treatment weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
in H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent to CY@@ P3@@ A4 , distinctive increases of plasma seal at the same time .
since plasma imaging of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a rh@@ ubar@@ b oly@@ sis , the combined application of this drug is not recommended with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r .
there is a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations until stabil@@ ising the mirror , as the plasma cent@@ re@@ rations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased in the same term of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ pr@@ ase cannot be used together with oral r@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while using the same application of ag@@ ony with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am plasma concentration camp around 3 @-@ 4 tor@@ rent .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given together with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ at@@ rous symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the very low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given , like am@@ b@@ av@@ ir@@ ir@@ - dose to adapt if Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time .
simultaneous monitoring of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ums along with A@@ ar@@ ase , a increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a we@@ aker or rein@@ forcement of the anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tive is not predic@@ table , hence alternative methods recommended for contrac@@ eption .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and adverse effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example , Des@@ i@@ pra@@ min and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is advised by the same term of as@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this drug may only be applied to the potential risks for the fet@@ us during pregnancy only after the pregnancy .

the in@@ cor@@ di@@ ality of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ ar@@ ase treatment were slightly until moderate , they rose early and led rarely to treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are used in connection with the medication or other at the same time for HIV @-@ treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the core condition .
most of the above @-@ mentioned side effects were obtained from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ em@@ ers were not treated twice a day twice daily .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and their extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ou@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) in patients with cervical inhibit@@ ors in patients with vi@@ rology errors more than 96 weeks , the following Prot@@ e@@ as@@ em@@ mer mut@@ ations :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance based analysis , gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ure inhibit@@ or resistance .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defined resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ V , I@@ 54@@ A / C / S / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / C / G / S / S / S / W / V , I@@ 62@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations at Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r , with a reduced lik@@ el@@ ihood of a vi@@ rology response ( resistance ) .
conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations , changes can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to always attract the current Inter@@ pret@@ ation systems to analyze the results of resistance tests .
based on ph@@ e@@ otyp@@ ic resistance based analy@@ tics @-@ based phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data on the estimate of activity of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ure resistance to isol@@ ates .
companies using diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( separ@@ ating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ b@@ abo@@ r associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ viol@@ r however remains generally preserved .
there are currently data to cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and other protagon@@ ists for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral patients , one of them showed an resistance to Lop@@ in@@ viol@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ viol@@ r ( one of 25 Isol@@ ate ) , Dar@@ in@@ viol@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 ins@@ ane ) , Lop@@ in@@ viol@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ viol@@ r ( three out of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ viol@@ r ( three out of 24 Isol@@ ate ) and Ti@@ den@@ cavi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
vice versa , Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase inhibit@@ or resistant insul@@ ates ; ob@@ taining these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early termination of a reconc@@ iled therapy is advised to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries which can react to the following treatment .
the proof of the efficacy of ag@@ ony in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which PI pre@@ treated to vi@@ rology ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ sid@@ an@@ alogy ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , So@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dos@@ ing ritual .
one hundred thre@@ und@@ sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to ag@@ ra@@ ase , at least one of the PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis represented the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the So@@ C PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ le@@ eve shaft of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the proof of the efficacy of non @-@ bent A@@ war@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 with PI were treated .
in the studies , A@@ generic solution was assigned to intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low do@@ si@@ sted Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml at a median increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Based on these data , the treatment optim@@ isation should be considered at PI pre @-@ treated children of &quot; un@@ ble@@ oo@@ die &quot; ath@@ em@@ ase .
according to oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) up to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given together with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ b@@ abo@@ u 12 hours following dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the equivalent of the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distributor volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and lets up a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease of the concentration of active substance in plasma , with the amount of un@@ connected am@@ b@@ abo@@ r which represents the active share , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ connected am@@ bition remains constant , the percentage of the free active part of the free active part during the dos@@ ing intervals in the Ste@@ ady State &apos;s total concentration in the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
thus , drug may be induced or absorb CY@@ P3@@ A4 or absorb a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 with caution when they are given at the same time using car@@ ri@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of ag@@ ra@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ ylo@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ availability than taken out of the capsules ; therefore , ag@@ ony solution and ag@@ ony capsules are not inter@@ changeable at a milli@@ gramm@@ ar basis .
even the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of kidney function is likely to be low on the elimination of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ b@@ abo@@ r plasma proteins , comparable to those who are obtained to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ b@@ abo@@ r twice daily without the same appointment of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for the carcin@@ ogen@@ icity of mice and rats appeared at male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ genic aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages , which were treated to the 2,0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) exposure to the people , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg am@@ b@@ abo@@ r .
the 21 under@@ lying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ genic aden@@ omas and carcin@@ oma was not yet clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for human beings is un@@ clear .
however , from the present ex@@ position data on humans , both in clinical trials and clinical use , however , little evidence of the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse mutation ( Am@@ es @-@ test ) , mouse lymph@@ oma test , was included in rats and chromosome aber@@ ration to human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ b@@ abo@@ r was neither mut@@ an@@ odi@@ zed nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ically .
these liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored in clinical everyday life with AST , AL@@ T , and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
so far , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of A@@ zo@@ ase nor after the treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality rate in both the controls and with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r animals .
in a systematic plas@@ ma@@ ex@@ position , which was significantly higher ( rabbits ) or significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which point to a delayed development .
24 If ai@@ st@@ asy capsules are applied without the enh@@ ancing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ bs ) , higher doses have to be applied to ag@@ itate ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for ag@@ ra@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ b@@ abo@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg am@@ b@@ abo@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous application is to be carried out in patients with weak or weak liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , methods are available to determine the substance concentration .
ag@@ rot@@ ase should be canc@@ eled in length 27 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with pharmaceutical dependent factors such as a lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and related metabolic disorders associated with the metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ rology and lead to a resistance development .
508 % increases , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r in plasma , which were achieved during the combination of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg ch@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ nights .
a recommended dosage for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended a close monitoring , as the effectiveness and un@@ think@@ able this combination is not known .
the treatment with ec@@ om@@ int@@ ment in combination with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ viol@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ em@@ akers would be low .

the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years of present data show that about 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically healed , which remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three times a weekly application in one or two treatment rooms of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the patients had clin@@ ically typical , invisible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic acc@@ uses within an inter@@ connected 25 c@@ m2 large treatment area than on the hair@@ y scal@@ p or in face .
the two @-@ yearly monitoring studies show a recur@@ rent rate of 27 % for patients with clinical release after one or two treatment times ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
authorised indications of external in@@ clin@@ ations , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ elles bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma are usually not focused on and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was investigated in four randomised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies in children aged 2 to 15 years with m@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo = 313 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or b ) .
a minimum systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream with the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose was observed in three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml at the application in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the estimated obvious half @-@ time period was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour period after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study , which points to an extended re@@ ten@@ tion of the drug in the skin .
data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low and comparable to top@@ ical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study to der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; a study carried out no similar effects in the mouse over four months .
a two @-@ year study on the carcin@@ ogen@@ icity of mice had no tum@@ ors at the application of three days a week .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but because I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ iny , is a risk for people due to the systemic exposure as very low .
the tum@@ ors stood in the group of mice treated with the real @-@ free cream , previously and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ ka ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ tin I ( M@@ PS I ; α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurological symptoms of the disease ( the symptoms that do not exist with brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( Gly@@ kos@@ am@@ ino@@ gl@@ kan@@ es , G@@ yp@@ h ) are not de@@ min@@ ed and thus ten@@ ds to accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neurological symptoms of M@@ PS I may occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements are harder , reduced lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be supervised by a physician who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should occur in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alising devices , and the patient need to prevent the administration in particular to prevent an allergic reaction .

in the study , primarily the safety of the drug was investigated , however , its effectiveness was measured as well ( by its effect on the reduction of g@@ ag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me recorded the G@@ ag concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children recorded a normal liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) , headache , nausea , abdominal pain , skin rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion .
very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dial ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be in@@ sensitive to patients who are possibly highly sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will require all new information that may be well @-@ known , check and update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who observe Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in terms of reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the European Commission to Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the placing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mammals ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indigenous to long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ ka ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ tin I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase deficiency ) , to treat non @-@ neurological symptoms of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edit@@ ary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient contributes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme may be recommended .
safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme may be recommended .
treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any adverse events that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should also be controlled eng@@ m@@ esh@@ ed , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be available in an adequate clinical environment in which re@@ vit@@ ational facilities will immediately be available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , we expect almost all patients from Ig@@ G antibodies to Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase , generally within 3 months of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution by using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
since a bit of experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction has to be cau@@ tious after a dis@@ ruption of treatment .
treat 60 minutes before the inc@@ in@@ fusion of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti @-@ py@@ rami@@ fications ) to minim@@ ize the potential appearance of in@@ fusion .
in case of mild or moderate in@@ fu@@ sions , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen was needed and / or reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction has occurred .
in the case of a single , severe in@@ fu@@ sions , in@@ fusion has to be stopped , until the symptoms are brought to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to consider .
in@@ fusion can be absorbed again with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction has occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with intra@@ cell inclusion in Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase exists .
animal experiments are not allowed to direct or indirect damages to the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exp@@ on@@ ated opposite the breast milk , is recommended , while the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not too quiet .
side @-@ effects in clinical trials were identified mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of up to 1 year ) .
un@@ wanted medication related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and the extension of a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older with a total treatment duration of up to 4 years ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation in the upper respiratory tract and lungs in history , severe reactions came out , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ els , breathing difficulty and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me who were reported during a phase of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly serious damage form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously one week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ian version , with one of the patients aged under 5 years with a heavier deteri@@ oration in one month ( on average after 26 days in patients at the age of 5 years and over ) .
up to the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to an early output from the study ) in 13 / 45 patients had no detection antibodies ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay det@@ ectable antibodies , among them 3 patients , where there was never been a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with lack of antibodies to low antibodies showed a robust reduction in the G@@ ag spi@@ ke in the resin , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ fications a variable reduction of g@@ ag in the Har@@ n was noted .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal until low @-@ neutral effect on enzy@@ matic lar@@ onic activity in vitro , which seemed to be un@@ affected by clinical efficacy and / or reducing G@@ ag in the Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of adverse reactions , even if the occurr@@ ence of adverse reactions coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the grounds for the en@@ cephal@@ ic therapy lies in one of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ats and the prevention of a further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enzymes .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is quickly removed from circulation and cells into the lymp@@ ho@@ sis , the most likely more than man @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study involving 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients recruited for the study , which referred to the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype , and only one patient showed the serious phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited if they had a forced exp@@ atri@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in 6 @-@ minute walk @-@ test .
all patients were then recruited for an open label extension study where she received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week ( 182 weeks ) every week .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients across the placebo group to improve the lung function and the ability to be shown in the following table .
in the open extension study , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects can be seen from up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as seen from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant over this period of clin@@ ically significant and the absolute lung @-@ volumes increased disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ately proportional to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atomic figure reached 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size .
during the first 4 weeks a significant reduction in the g@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ inin ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study .
regarding the het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous disease that takes into account the clin@@ ically significant changes for five efficacy variable ( at least in the 6 @-@ minute walk , movement area of the shoulder @-@ bearing AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a year @-@ old open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined at 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with the heavy displacement form and 4 with the middle drop form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n in week 22 over the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients one size growth ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle compar@@ ing form a normal spiritual development speed , whereas only limited or even no progress in cog@@ nitive development were observed .
in a phase 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me met@@ amor@@ ous schemes were performed on the G@@ ag mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously one week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can result in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two Do@@ si@@ zing Schem@@ ata is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will assess any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug may be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ time gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift and reproduction , pre @-@ clinical data cannot recognize any special dangers for human beings .

A@@ lim@@ ta is applied together with Cis@@ pl@@ atin ( other medicines for cancer ) if the cancer is &quot; non re@@ se@@ z@@ able &quot; ( malign@@ ant cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer that is not attacking the epi@@ theli@@ al cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used for patients who previously were not treated , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously had previously operated other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
to decrease side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( vitamin ) and vitamin B12 .
when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with Cis@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic &quot; ( medicines for vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood samples are changed , or if certain other side effects occur , treatment should be applied , or the dose is reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed thus slow@@ ed down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells .
converting P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form advances in cancer cells lighter than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active time of cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease .
for the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta have been treated in a study on 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which previously had previously been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( an other drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( other medicines for cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12,@@ 1 months compared with 9.3 months in the resulting application of Cis@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy had an average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared to 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , patients with which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epi@@ theli@@ al cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ a longer survival compared to the comparison medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for placing A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each bottle of the bottle has to be reduced with 4.2 ml of 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the appropriate volume of the necessary met@@ - sis is taken from the bottle with a 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin shown to first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , except with vast drive epi@@ theli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completing P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reaction must be given a day before and on the day of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift as well as the treatment of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid .
during the seven days before the first dose P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid have to be taken and the intake must be continued during the entire treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ ric dose .
patients also need to receive intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after every third operating cycle .
in patients who receive p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed before each gift should be created a complete blood image , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose check is taking place under the basis of the N@@ adi@@ rs of blood @-@ bil@@ ites or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous treatment cycles .
after recovery , the patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which apply for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria are the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
if patients should develop non @-@ hem@@ atology toxic@@ ity ≥ 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted by the patient , before the treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be broken when patients are zo@@ oming and non @-@ hem@@ atology toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ atology toxic@@ ity levels of 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or in comparison to patients at the age of 65 years , an increased by @-@ effective anne@@ x .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data for un@@ question@@ able and effectiveness .
in clinical trials , patients with a cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance have no dose of ≥ 45 ml / min no dose custom@@ iz@@ ations required for all patients recommended dose adjust@@ ments .
data in patients with a cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of below 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function limit of &gt; 1.5 times the upper level of B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limits and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; 3.0 times the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ asis ) or &gt; 5,0 times the upper limit value ( with presence of liver metast@@ asis ) are not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored in terms of bone mar@@ mal@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be administered to patients , before its absolute neut@@ rop@@ hi@@ lic number has reached a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cylinder has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a Dos@@ age reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute neutral number , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ tion and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - see section 4.2 .
lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ ec@@ ologic toxic@@ ity like neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neutr@@ rop@@ enia was de@@ emed if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
all patients have to be instructed with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as a proph@@ yl@@ tic measure to reduce un@@ conditional toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ oric acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before therapy , on day of therapy and mind@@ - avoid 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ etry ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who are planned for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is required to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients , in which these events occurred , had appropriate risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including dehy@@ d@@ ration , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
for patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid assets in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the result is expected to be prec@@ urs@@ ed before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events have been reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally if this drug has usually been administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic active substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vaccination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible rat@@ ory of reproductive ability is made by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before treatment - G@@ inn to obtain advice on the sperm supply .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ atically ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can result in a reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ ric ex@@ cre@@ tion with the consequence of an increased occurr@@ ence of side effects .
therefore , caution is advis@@ able when patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) is applied to high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on day of therapy and mind@@ - tens of 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ etry ( see section 4.4 ) .
as no data regarding the in@@ calcul@@ ator with N@@ SA@@ IDs , with long @-@ value time such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ etry .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ums and ant@@ in@@ astic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) , when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ cip@@ es .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - an@@ timet@@ abol@@ ites are expected during pregnancy in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary and after careful handling of the farm for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an irre@@ versi@@ bly damage of reproductive ability is made by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment start , advice regarding the sper@@ mac@@ on@@ ser@@ vi@@ dia .
it is not known if P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into breast milk and un@@ wanted effects in the breast@@ feed inf@@ ant cannot be excluded .

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received testing in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statistically significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the malign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole Cis@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms revealed itself by improving lung function parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function in time in the control arm .
a multic@@ ent@@ ric , randomised , open phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy was the median survival of patients treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Population n = 283 ) and 7.9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .

limited data of a separately randomised , controlled Phase 3 study demonstrate that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) is similar to patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of IT@@ T population and support non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AL@@ IM@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine Cis@@ pl@@ atin combination .
median PFS was 4.8 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine Cis@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1,@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 27.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine Cis@@ pl@@ atin .

it is used in overweight adults with a body massage index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , fet@@ tre@@ du@@ ed diet .
patients who take all@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks , should turn to their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , some fats can &apos;t disman@@ tle them in food , thereby resulting in a quarter of the fats of the food de@@ hydr@@ ated to the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , all@@ i was compared with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in the two studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in the taking of placebo .
in the study with all@@ i in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no patients could be observed for the patient &apos;s relevant weight loss .
the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots at after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with bo@@ wel movements , chair crisis , fet@@ al / o@@ ily chair , finish o@@ ily sparkling pigs ( barrels ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be applied in patients that are treated with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent the organ slip case ) or drugs like war@@ far@@ in for preventing blood cl@@ ots .
it may also be applied to patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( if not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or to chol@@ est@@ asis ( liver disease ) , and at pregnant or in still@@ s .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a approval for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K across the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ical , fet@@ tre@@ du@@ ous diet .
all@@ i cannot be applied to children and adolescents under 18 because there is no sufficient data for effectiveness and safety .
since Or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally re@@ adily absorbed , with reduced liver and / or kidney function , no adju@@ sting the dosage is necessary .

the lik@@ el@@ ihood of occurr@@ ence gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat food and low @-@ fat food .
as the weight reduction in diabetes with improved metabolic control can assume that patients who take a drug against diabetes before the start of a therapy with all@@ i to consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic may have to be adjusted .
patients who take all@@ i and medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol , should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ists if the dosage needs to be adapted .
it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ating measures aimed to prevent oral contrac@@ ep@@ tions possible in the event of severe diar@@ rhoea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on inter@@ actions of medicines as well as in several cases , with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma bars was observed .
in the use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ums in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values could be influenced ( internationally norm@@ alized ratio IN@@ R ) ( see section 4.8 ) .
most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at remained the concentration of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta car@@ otene .
however , the patient should be recommended before bed@@ time a supplement of mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin prepared to ensure adequate vit@@ amine ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of an injection dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed with a limited number of volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , a minor decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma cent@@ ration .
animal experiments showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and imp@@ ose the pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , as absorption of recorded fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the skins are defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not inv@@ al@@ u@@ able ) .
the frequency of the known side effects that were found after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size .
+ It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to Bek@@ le@@ mm@@ ings with regard to possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered daily over a period of 15 days , without any significant clinical findings .
at the majority of reported cases reported by or@@ list@@ at over@@ flow , either side effects or similar side effects as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at were reported .
based on studies on humans and animals , from a fast revers@@ al system of System@@ ic effects , which are attributed to li@@ pas@@ ti@@ zing properties from or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect is set in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper fertili@@ zation of co@@ valent bonds to the active ser@@ ene @-@ rest of the gast@@ ric and panic li@@ pas@@ ties .
clinical trials was derived from clinical studies that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at captured three times a day , the absorption of about 25 % of the food .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m covers the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fet@@ tre@@ du@@ ed diet .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of the boundary ) , was assessed as follows : as alter@@ ation of body weight in the study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the largest weight loss was observed in the first 6 months .
the average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( source value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( source value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) with placebo + 2.8 % ( source value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average amend@@ ment of L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output equivalent to 3.@@ 30 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mol / l ) .

alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting ( such as Cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies , moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , dos@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic medication ) .
the application for patients under the age of 18 is not recommended , as to the effects in this age group do not have enough information .
this means that the substance stimul@@ ate the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are severe or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting showed , 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi did not receive vomiting ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting showed that 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were no vomiting ( 153 von 189 ) compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron patients ( 127 from 185 ) .
in comparison to Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted a approval to the company Helsinki n Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . an auth@@ orization for placing of Alo@@ xi states in the entire European Union .
alo@@ xi is indicated : prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease .
the effectiveness of alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vomiting , which is induced by a heavily em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding one before the cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
da Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the thick@@ et level , patients with an@@ am@@ nesty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is advis@@ able in the same gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs which leng@@ then the Q@@ T interval or in patients , with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is leng@@ th@@ ened or tend to tend to such an extension .
except in connection with another chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics @-@ gift , Alo@@ xi will not be used to prevent nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy .
in clinical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron inhi@@ bited the activity of the five studied chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , dos@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady high concentration of met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a population based on a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis , CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ troly@@ b , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Ch@@ ini@@ din , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ din , ni@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience to use Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies lie not before , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied during pregnancy , unless the doctor &apos;s doctor is considered necessary .
in clinical trials , the most common in clinical trials were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly with alo@@ gies , headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the administration location ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar bodies of adverse events showed themselves similar to adverse events such as in the other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships .
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective treatment in a alo@@ xi@@ r over@@ dose .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received rigid phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were given to patients who received 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( half @-@ value 7.3 hours ) , which was administered intraven@@ ously on Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ one intraven@@ ous .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine and 250@@ mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine , with patients compared to 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron received intraven@@ ously 1 intraven@@ ous patients .
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation , and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study conducted in 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ v. ab@@ ated Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows a long @-@ term elimination of plasma @-@ plac@@ ements a slow Eli@@ min@@ ation from the body with an average of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma cent@@ ration ( C@@ max ) and the surface below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally examined in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 m / kg ( kg ) and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses laid out at 11 high @-@ level cancer patients ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma cent@@ ration at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations that at once daily intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous injection of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached the overall value of 0.@@ 75 mg of measured value ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the injection of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated via the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabolism , which have compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron above less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies for met@@ abol@@ isation have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
Eli@@ min@@ ation After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours of urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered drug made approximately 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous bol@@ etus injection , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the full Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function are increased the termin@@ ale of elimination of elimination and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions , which are considered sufficient by the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use .
10 . clinical studies have shown evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels , which are involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ formation and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and leng@@ then the shareholder duration .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose of the therapeutic exposure of man ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ theli@@ um ( in thy@@ roid , pit@@ u@@ itary , pancre@@ as , tribut@@ ary mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the under@@ lying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and Alo@@ xi used for a unique application , the relevance of these results will be low as for humans .
the auth@@ orization of this auth@@ orization has to be informed by the European Commission on the plans for placing on this decision to be approved by this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) passed a negative opinion in which the prescribed approval for the treatment for the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended by Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means al@@ ph@@ eon was supposed to be similar to a biological medicine called R@@ of@@ er@@ one @-@ A which is similar to the same drug , which is already approved in the EU ( also known as &quot; reference assistant &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ persistent ) Hepatitis C ( one of liver disease caused by virus infection ) .
during a micro@@ scop@@ ic analysis the liver tissue damage damage , in addition , the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ in- Amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to stimul@@ ate this to the formation of active substance .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon introduced data that prove the comparison of Alph@@ eon with R@@ of@@ eron @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , security and efficacy of hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with Hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alph@@ eon was compared to the efficacy of Alph@@ eon with efficacy of reference to 4@@ 55 patients .
in the study , as many patients were evaluated after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of treatment on the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or Distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non business atten@@ de@@ . what were the greatest concerns which causes the CH@@ MP to make the approval for placing on the market ?
furthermore , concerns expressed in detail that the data for the stability of the drug and the market@@ able disease were not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C dedicated to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and R@@ of@@ eron @-@ A were similar in the clinical trial .
after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon was ret@@ ard@@ ant the disease in more patients than at the reference surgeon ; moreover , Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the study was used in the study to investigate the question , in@@ correct the medication is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be applied to the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cruci@@ fying education ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ ves ) , det@@ on@@ ations and se@@ wn up wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used for treating infections , which have been proven to be proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because of the alarm against this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under the age of 18 may not be compared to treated skin surface more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient is not addressing the treatment after two or three days , the physician should once again examine the patient and draw alternative treatments .
it acts with blocking of bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of bacterial deposits in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
main indicators of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was withdrawn after the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients with placebo spoke to the treatment .
for the treatment of infected windows showed al@@ tar@@ go and c@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together at Hau@@ tw@@ ood , about 90 % of the patients of both groups were treated .
in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go has been detected in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( eit@@ fully filled hollow in body tissues ) or infection , which have been proven to be proven or presumably by MR@@ SA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is irrit@@ ation at the contrac@@ tor .
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of al@@ tar@@ go occur in short @-@ term skin infections with the risks of the following superf@@ icial skin infections : • im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small la@@ de@@ formations , loss , or se@@ wn wounds .
the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . in May 2007 , the European Commission granted auth@@ orization for placing al@@ tar@@ go to the entire European Union .
the patients , in which within two or three days does not show improvement , should be examined at once and an alternative therapy is considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is to be abol@@ ished , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully cut and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection are started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials for secondary infected wounds the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin @-@ resistant pile @-@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were in@@ sufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered , if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected spot occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical resources on the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
a clinical @-@ relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected due to the low plasma cent@@ ration which were reduced to human skin or infected surface treatments ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous operation of 2 times a day 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be on reduced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the minor systemic exposure after top@@ ical application in patients , dose custom@@ iz@@ ations are not required if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin applied during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive review of oral consumption and are in@@ sufficient in relation to a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy , when a top@@ ical anti @-@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is to be preferred by a systemic antibiotic .
in deci@@ ding whether the breast@@ feeding continued / terminated , or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continued to be continued , is between the benefit of the breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials involving 2,@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported adverse effect of irrit@@ ation at the administration meeting , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
the effect of action of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic derivatives of P@@ hal@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated from fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ opilot us pass@@ ag@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ er@@ anus ) .
the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective in@@ hibition of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding point of the 50s sub@@ division of the bacterial rift , which differs from the binding other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial substances .
data suggest that the engagement of the ri@@ bos@@ omes protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ omes P @-@ bind@@ ings and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase@@ Center .
due to binding on this engagement , P@@ ligh@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line avo@@ ids the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , block partial P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if the treatment of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear in at least some information forms , advice should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity from Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin towards S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin .
in case of a failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was put daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and to restri@@ ct skin for up to 7 days .
out of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ mati@@ ous wounds , single plasma samples were produced .
the sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake at the people after top@@ ical application of 1 % sal@@ ts on 200 c@@ m2 of reduced skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro review on gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats @-@ micro@@ kern@@ test to in @-@ vi@@ vo study chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither male nor female rats signs of restricted fer@@ til@@ ation at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which achieves up to 5 times higher exposure when the highest estimated exposure of people ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 ) was reduced to a reduced skin :
in an embr@@ y@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study of rats were observed at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development of development ( reduced body weight of fet@@ uses ) and maternal toxic@@ ity .

ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases which affect the liver ) in children between one and 15 years which are not immune to these two diseases .
ambient rix is applied as part of a two doses existing vaccination , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , ambi@@ rix are only allowed if during immun@@ isation , a low risk of hepatitis B infection is ensured and ensured that the vaccine can be led up to the end of two doses .
if a re@@ frac@@ tive dose for hepatitis A or B is desired , the ambi@@ rix or any other Hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given .
vaccination works by bringing the immune system ( the natural resistance of the body ) , &quot; as it can resist a disease .
once a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and generates antibodies against it .
ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the vaccine manufacturer Twin@@ rix adults and the vaccine registered in 1997 Twin@@ rix children .
the three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix are given an existing vaccine for three doses .
because ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix are also included identical substances , some of the data that supports the use of Twin@@ rix adults , also as proof for use of ambi@@ rix .
the main indicators for effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , which had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibody concentrated .
in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six months and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injec@@ tions .
in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix introduced a month after the last injection of anti @-@ antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of ambi@@ rix was similar to a sixth and a 12 @-@ month distance between the injec@@ tions .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection process , redness , mat@@ ness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
ambient is allowed in patients that may not be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) not to be applied .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals , i.@@ a. a approval for the placing of ambi@@ rix in the entire
the standardi@@ zation plan for the basic di@@ mm@@ is@@ isation with ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refresh@@ ment is requested for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ arian vaccine or with a combination of combination .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen - anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ BC ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies lie in the same size as following vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ arian vaccine .
it is not fully assured whether immune competent persons who have addressed a sus@@ pic@@ ion of hepatitis C , which may need to be protected as protection , as they may also be protected by immune memory through the immune memory .
3 . as with all injection vaccine , the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction should be available immediately after the gift of vaccines and monitoring possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is necessary , the standardi@@ zation system is recommended using the combination of the combination of hepatitis B , which contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients with dys@@ functions of immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies are achieved so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required .
since a intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could result in a sub@@ optimal impact result , these injec@@ tions should be avoided .
however , if Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ top@@ ia or blood co@@ ag@@ ulation disorders can be inj@@ ected by sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , as it may occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration .
if ambi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate injec@@ tor at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a- , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or combined with a combined mas@@ re@@ - m@@ um@@ ps disease vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ant therapy or patients with immune defects have to be assumed that maybe no sufficient immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccine doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , val@@ ency , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever comparable to the frequency , which was observed in previous Thi@@ omer@@ ang and preser@@ vative @-@ based vaccine form@@ ul@@ ating .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccines have been given to a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ doses combination .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maturity based on a calculation basis per vaccination dose ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 7 % of subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 doses .
according to the complete vaccination cycle 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who had received ambi@@ rix were vacc@@ inated over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects who have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose .
the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ dness was comparable high ( i.e. about the entire vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of subjects who received ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects who received 3 doses of combination ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and consistency was low and comparable to that the combination of the combination of the combination of the combination with the 3 @-@ cans vaccine was observed .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1- @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old vaccine , the occurr@@ ence of local actions and general actions in the ambient diagnosis was comparable to the hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able Hepatitis B @-@ Surface surface with 360 ELISA units .
however , for the 6- to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , after vaccination with ambi@@ rix a frequently earlier occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection process ) per dose , is not reported .
the share of vaccines that reported over severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccination schemes with the combination of 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen , was not statistically different .
in clinical studies that were carried out at vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 @-@ suggested dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serum rate for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose , and 100 % one month after the second , to the month 6 given dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination of three doses .
in the 289 people whose immun@@ o@@ gene@@ ity was evaluated , the serum rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dose of dose than with ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , which were reached in a clinical comparison study of 1- @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , one month after the end of the full vaccination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ inations have received either a 2 @-@ doses vaccines with a combination of 360 ELISA units , with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able Hepatitis B surface .
at persons who were at the time of the basic idea between 12 and 15 years , the per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies could be detected on at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months .
the immune response to both anti@@ gens was comparable to both anti@@ gens , which was formed in combination with a combination of 360 ELISA units , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ an A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study of 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it could be shown that the per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months of vaccination is comparable to the vaccination of 0 @-@ 12 months .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time with the with@@ drawing of a combined diabe@@ tic , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza type b @-@ vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study that was performed with 3 doses of current formulation in adults , showed similar formulation and serum samples like earlier formulation .
the vaccine is also possible to investigate any external particles and / or physically visible changes after the reset .
according to Article 114 of the directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state @-@ of @-@ state char@@ ms will be made of a state lab or any of this purpose authorized lab .

an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching skin rash , short@@ ness or swelling of the face or tongue . • if a allergic reaction has occurred to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B once with you / your child . • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the planned administration of the second vaccination dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from an in@@ oc@@ ulation with ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend to you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective stock levels ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content is usually given a month after the first dose to give you a vaccination protection before ending the vaccination series .
sometimes , am@@ rix are inj@@ ected by individuals who are suffering from serious blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not inj@@ ected into muscle . • If you are weak@@ ened due to a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s body or if you / your child is under@@ lining to a hem@@ og@@ aly@@ sis .
ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons can &apos;t be sufficient , so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccination is .
21 Say to your doctor if you have to take a further medicine , ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated prior to your child / has been given to immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case , the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient , therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and possible at different lim@@ bs .
if ambi@@ rix are to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient .
normally , am@@ rix pregnant or lact@@ ating women are not given , except it is ur@@ gently needed that they are vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
if you miss the agreed time for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .
♦ very frequent ( more than 1 case per 10 coated cans ) : • pain or complaints at inhal@@ ation or redness • headache • headache • lack of appetite
♦ frequent ( up to 1 case per 10 coated cans ) : • Incre@@ ase of the injection process • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • F@@ ail@@ ment of gastro@@ intestinal disorders
other side effects , the days or weeks after the vaccination with comparable combination of hepatitis A and Hepatitis B , are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 coated cans ) , are :
these include local limited or extensive reports that can be ju@@ x or bli@@ stering , swelling of the eyes and facial , create breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure fall and loss of consciousness .

23 Inform@@ ing your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if one of the listed side effects you / your child significantly imp@@ airs or you notice serious side effects that are not specified in this package file .
ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which have been known since issu@@ ing the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP came to a positive opinion that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since ambi@@ rix was only transported in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the data security data are limited to this drug due to its small patient ex@@ position .
Am@@ mon@@ ochro@@ me may also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defective or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia concentrations ( brain damage due to high am@@ moni@@ als ) in history .
Am@@ mon@@ schn@@ aps - split by several single doses to the meals - swallowed , among the food mixed or over a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ y also ( due to the abdominal wall in the stomach @-@ leading hose ) or a no@@ stri@@ probe ( through the nose leading hose ) .
there was no compar@@ ative study because Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo ( a placebo medicine , i.e. without substance ) .
ammon@@ ium may also cause loss of loss , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid re@@ jection , taste problems or taste loss , abdominal pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , unpleasant body od@@ or , or weight gain .
at the end , the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ ey@@ es@@ eed in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the body is effective to high am@@ moni@@ als .
Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; due to the rarity of the condition at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine .
the use is indicated in all patients , with which a complete enzyme organ has already been manifest@@ ed in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ solid form ( in@@ complete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first phase of life ) is an indication of the application if in the history of history a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing problems , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually calculated by the protein tolerance and the patient &apos;s growth and the development for daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ inine in a dose of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early di@@ mani@@ fold deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ amide .
patients with an Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ ucc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must get arg@@ inine at a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given patients with gor@@ ges , as a risk of the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a exists if the tablets don &apos;t get into the stomach immediately .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used with counter con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al failure and with sodium re@@ ten@@ tion and ede@@ tion .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is carried out on liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution .
the importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is unknown ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
at sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ ons and an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it was also a delayed appeal of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth .
it could not be found if Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic will be eliminated in the breast milk and this is the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the stand@@ still counter ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients were at least an adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these undes@@ i@@ red events had assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lact@@ ate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , periph@@ eral neurop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dose appeared in a 5 @-@ month old small child with a normal single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic , which showed dos@@ is@@ ec@@ ox@@ icity with an intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic is a metabolic compound which con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine glut@@ amine con@@ ju@@ gated by the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with u@@ rea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that , for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis started early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early mani@@ fold form of the disease with the occurr@@ ence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ antry , and the disease carried out even in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with its sti@@ cking free an@@ alogy within the first year of life to death .
due to ha@@ em@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative path@@ way of nitrogen oxide ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic ) , proteins reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first phase of life ) .
in patients whose disease had been diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients with many mental disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ solid form of the disease ( including female patients with het@@ ero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of or@@ ni@@ th@@ at@@ op@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing Neu@@ rolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly re@@ versi@@ bly and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the Neu@@ rolog@@ ical state may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were identified according to an individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in sober @-@ free adults and in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of urine test , as well as repeated gifts of oral doses ranging from up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabolism was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous injection of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablets , 15 minutes after intake measurement of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat was detected .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycli@@ c disorders ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning after night fasting no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic was det@@ ectable in the plasma .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the medium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations have been treated five times higher than the first gifts on the third day .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us testing , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no cl@@ ast@@ ogenic effects treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either by oral ( infants and children who have not yet been able to swal@@ low any pills , or patients with can@@ y@@ bean disorders ) or a no@@ stri@@ a .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , arg@@ inine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be held within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ inine in a dose of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early di@@ mani@@ fold deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ amide .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if rat switches off the birth of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic ( an active met@@ abo@@ lition of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) was exposed to les@@ ions in the py@@ rami@@ ds of the brain .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lact@@ ate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , periph@@ eral neurop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with u@@ rea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess weight
based on studies , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing Neu@@ rolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly re@@ versi@@ bly , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the Neu@@ rolog@@ ical state may occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after intake measurement of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat was detected .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the completed product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of no more than 25 ° C .
in this case , the small measuring sco@@ op 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring sco@@ op 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient must receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare cases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they accum@@ ulate the sti@@ ck@@ eting waste products based on the consumption of proteins in the body .
if you are done with lab testing , you will need to inform the doctor that you may influence AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other drugs please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you have taken other medicines or recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs .
during the breast@@ feeding you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because the medicine could go into the breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , headache , taste problems , dis@@ closure of hearing , dis@@ orient@@ ations , memory disorders , and deteri@@ oration of existing neurological conditions were observed .
if you notice one of these symptoms , you immediately sit with your doctor or with the emergency recording of your hospital for the introduction of appropriate treatment .
if you forget to forget AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in blood circulation ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ at@@ ocy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , nausea , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant skin od@@ or , skin rash , kidney disorders , weight gain and abnormal lab values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if one of the listed side effects are significantly imp@@ aired or you may notice serious side effects that are not specified in this manual information .
you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS according to the cart@@ on and container ship after &quot; using the specified expi@@ ration date . &quot;
like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , and contents of the pack AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are made of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are equipped with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot;
30 If the laboratory tests are performed , you will need to inform the doctor that you may take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other drugs please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you have taken other medicines or recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS on the same single doses , or about a gast@@ ric fi@@ ose ( hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a no@@ stri@@ de ( hose , which is led by the nose into the stomach ) .

An@@ gi@@ ox is applied for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute ret@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example , in inst@@ abil@@ er ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with varying strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; St@@ up@@ lift &quot; ( an abnormal measurement of the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients that inter@@ fere with a PCI is administered to a higher dose and in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after surgery .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of ACS , with the effect of angi@@ ox in sole gift or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination therapy with h@@ ep@@ arin ( another anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI was frequently a st@@ ent ( a short tubes , which remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a lock ) , and they received another drug on preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
at the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox@@ - with or without gift of GP@@ I - following the prevention of new events ( deaths , cardiac fail@@ ures , or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients suffering from a PCI was An@@ gi@@ ox@@ in relation to all indicators as effective as h@@ ep@@ arin , except for heavy bleeding , with which it was significantly more effective than h@@ ep@@ arin .
angi@@ ox is not allowed to be applied in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ valent ( allergic ) against bi@@ valent ( allergic ) against bi@@ valent ( allergic ) or any of other components .
it must also be applied in patients who recently had a blood@@ stream , as well as with people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is at the treatment of ACS and while a PCI is a acceptable replacement for h@@ ep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission presented The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . approval for placing on@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute ret@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ do inf@@ ar@@ ction ) ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) , or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in another row , another bolt should be given up to 0.5 mg / kg and increases in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI in clinical conditions , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours .
an in@@ fusion of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered directly before the procedure , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the impact .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI is of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body@@ weight and one of these intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous intra@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
the security and efficacy of a sole bol@@ us gift of angi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI surgery is planned .
if this value is reduced to about 225 seconds , it should be reduced to a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight .
to reduce the occurr@@ ence of lower ACT values , the re@@ con@@ stituted and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and are administered intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , additional monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney disease ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which is subjected to a PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate should be used by 1.4 mg / kg / h .
if the ACT @-@ value is 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg is recommended , and the ACT was again re@@ examined 5 minutes after the second bolt .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which resulted in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) which led to approval was the ACT value 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis cases is angi@@ ox contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox@@ ical treatment can be initiated in 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous gift of un@@ fra@@ ction h@@ ep@@ arin or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift from burnt @-@ molecular h@@ ep@@ arin .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or any other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine - active hem@@ or@@ rh@@ es@@ ystems and / or irre@@ versi@@ bly mi@@ tig@@ ation disorders . • serious un@@ controlled hyper@@ ton@@ ia and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardiac . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis cases
the patients are carefully monitored in treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if in case of PCI @-@ patient under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ inal , most bleeding in the arter@@ ial punc@@ ture occur , patients who under@@ go a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur during the treatment in principle everywhere .
in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ valent ( International standardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International standardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) should ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be achieved before the treatment .
based on the knowledge about the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ cip@@ es ( h@@ ep@@ arin , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ates ) it may be assumed that these agents increase blood danger .
in combination with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ cip@@ es , clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis are regularly controlled in any case .
the experimental tests are in@@ sufficient in relation to the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the connection or post@@ nat@@ al development of inadequate ( see under Section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were randomised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tured h@@ ep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in the same @-@ treated compar@@ ative groups there were women and patients over 65 years more frequently in adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i measures for heavy bleeding as defined in table 2 .
both minor and heavy bleeding occurred under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone significantly less than in the groups with Hep@@ ar@@ ine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY has been defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding to punc@@ ture , preventing the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / d@@ L with well @-@ known blood pressure , re@@ operation due to a blood flow , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood loc@@ aliz@@ ations that occurred in more than 0,1 % ( occasionally ) , &quot; other &quot; points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in at 6000 patients who underwent a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in the same @-@ treated comparison groups there were women as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently compared with adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both minor and severe ble@@ edings occur under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in significantly less than in the compar@@ ative group under h@@ ep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported according to comprehensive application in the practice and are arranged according to system organs in table 6 .
in case of overdose , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is immediately broken down and the patient eng@@ m@@ esh@@ ed to monitor signs of bleeding .

the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in to th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in s@@ anders slowly the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby creating the function of the active center of thro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , teenagers and children from six years with diabetes which require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , inj@@ ected the th@@ igh@@ s , or upper arm with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin for the control of glucose ( sugar@@ s ) in blood or process insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs a very low of human insulin , and the change means that it seems faster and a shorter active time has become a short @-@ effective human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in the use with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body can not produce insulin in two studies with a total of 5@@ 72 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in case of type 2 diabetes , in which the body can not work effectively in effect , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicators for the effectiveness was the change of concentration of substance gly@@ ph@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed compared to a lowering of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin delivery .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration amounted to 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra should not be applied in patients that may be in@@ sensitive to insulin or any of other components , or in patients who have already suffering from hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra possibly need to be adjusted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH approval for placing A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the Del@@ tam@@ us@@ k or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injec@@ tions in the area of abdominal pain .
because of the reduced glucose capacity and dimin@@ ished insulin delivery , the insulin needs can be fixed in patients with a limitation of the liver function .
any change of active strength , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or manufacturing method can attract a change of insulin requirements .
3 A inadequate dosage or removal of a treatment , especially in patients with insulin requiring diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these states are potentially life threatening .
the change@@ over of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin in another manufacturer should be done under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage .
the time of occurr@@ ence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the effect of the insulin delivery and can therefore change the conversion of the treatment schem@@ as .
in order to increase blood glucose monitoring and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ glyc@@ emia , oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , fi@@ bre@@ ads , di@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxi@@ dation , pent@@ oxi@@ fi@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ lic acid , ic@@ y@@ lic acid and sul@@ phon@@ amide antibiotics .
additionally , under the effect of sympath@@ e@@ oly@@ tics such as bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ able , Cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and reser@@ pine the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen to be weak@@ ened or missing .
animal experiments showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ kind regarding the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known if insulin runs into human breast milk , but generally insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ ised after oral application .

Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y Will fails to continuously change the injection of injection within the injection of injection , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y can occur at the injection process .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cop@@ es with loss of consciousness can be given by a intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by a doctor or by intraven@@ ous administered by a physician .
after a glucose levels , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to prevent the Ur@@ - cause for severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers blood glucose levels by stimul@@ ating the periph@@ eral glucose ( especially by skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of insulin @-@ effect occurs faster and the drug duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is a therapeutic dos@@ ing area of 0.0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg a portion of proportional glu@@ cos@@ ity effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in the glucose reduction effect , just like human@@ kind .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast impact impact as normal human insulin and generates a complete glu@@ cos@@ ity effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data was clear that at an application of Insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ pon@@ al gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached like with human normal insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
insulin is@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal was taken - a better post@@ pon@@ sion@@ ate control than with human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal was reached .
insulin is absorbed in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control is used as in human normal insulin , which is 2 mi@@ ths before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - previously ) before the start of the meal was given 30 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1A ) , as well as compared to human antibodies that was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1B ) .
insulin delivery in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - after the beginning of the meal ) after the beginning of the meal , was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1C ) before the start of the meal .
