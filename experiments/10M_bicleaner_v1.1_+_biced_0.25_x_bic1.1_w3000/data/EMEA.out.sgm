<seg id="1">The present document is a summary of the European public report report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Humanitarian Assistance (CHMP) has judged the conducted studies in order to obtain recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you require further information about your disease or their treatment, please read the package file (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you want more information regarding the recommendations of the CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg. of melt tablets (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for taking (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B., thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or vision of things that are not present), mistrust and insulations; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychical disease in which patients have manic episodes (periods abnormal high mood) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes, and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used to rapid control of increased unrest or behavioral problems, if the oral medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be used to take or the melting tablets in patients, which will prepare the swallow of tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, the same as Abilify should be adapted to the dose of Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells together.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazene probably works mainly as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole such as 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in less measurements than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and their resentment will be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify, which may occur in symptoms, was examined in three studies by up to a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar illnesses which had suffered from a placebo over a period of two hours with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recovery in 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms have been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injectionin was developed in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that had suffered from stressed agitation which compared to Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the variation of symptoms of patients using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies in order to examine how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to inhale (decreases).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injectionable injection solution, Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased unrest than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In applying to the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify was more effective than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition to 74 weeks, Abilify prevented the failure of recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms were identified and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify to take (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients), vomiting, blurred vision, dyspepie (constant motion), vomiting, Nausea (constipation), spittle hypersecretion (increased spection), tiredness and exhaustion, ruthiness, insomnie (sleeping disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Humanitarian Assistance (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and of moderate to severe acid episodes in patients who had predominantly manic episodes in the treatment with Aripiprazole, opposite the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee came to the result that the advantages of injectionable restlessness and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia or patients with manic episodes at Bipolar-I disorder when an oral therapy is not suitable, opposite the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. an approval for placing from Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to heavy episodes of the Bipolar-I- disorder and the prevention of a new manic episode of patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily is independent of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not verified, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as a monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar-I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been detected.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the larger sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors occur (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the dipious benzene dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behaviours belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disturbances and was reported in some cases after the start or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased suicidal exposure with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions used for hypotonia (dehydration) or hypertension (including acerated and malign form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dysenters: in clinical studies that lasted one year or less, there was occasional reports about during the treatment with Aripiprazole Dyskiningrad.</seg>
<seg id="39">If with ABILIFY, patients treated signs and symptoms of late dysenters should be drawn into consideration, to reduce the dose or to break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mns, or unclear high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be deposed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole in patients with seizures in the anamhistory or states that stand with seizures in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazene in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, an elevated death of death in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There was, however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relation between the dosage and response to unwanted zerebrovascular events in treated with Aripiprazole patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related unwanted events, with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drugs treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally used in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania, the use of anti-psychotics in which weight gain as a side effect is observed and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazole can be taken in combination with alcohol or other centralised medicines such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study of healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased AUC by Aripiprazole for 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore should be similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">At CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolites, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma centages of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefit should be considered potential risks for patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteashibitors, must have similar effects and therefore should be similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting up the CYP2D6 or 3A4-inhibitor, the dose of ABILIFY should be raised to the Dosage height prior to the escort.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY can be used together with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole per day no significant effect on the metabolism of the CYP2D6 (dextromporphan / 3-methodology morphine ratio), 2C19 (Warfarin), 2C19 (dextromethorphic).</seg>
<seg id="58">The female should be advised to notify your doctor if pregnant, or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to inadequate data security for people and due to the concerns raised in the reproductive studies, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, the patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including automotive vehicles, until they are sure that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medical-relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the above-listed side effects is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study about 52 weeks in patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, a total of lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dysteronia and Dyskiningrad, compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study about 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients were treated with a placebo of 13.1% in patients.</seg>
<seg id="65">In a different long-term study about 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole, and 15.1% in patients with Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes at Bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled study more than 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under halopidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study more than 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% was diagnosed in patients with a respeczole treatment and 17.6% for those under Lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters, yielded no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases the CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of treated patients treated with a placebo compared to 2.0% treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">In relation to the side effects associated with an antipsychotic therapy, the maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskiningrad and seizures, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality rate in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since market launch, unintentional or intentional overdosiations were observed in adult patients with estimated dosages of up to 1260 mg and without deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">In fact, there are no information about the effectiveness of a hematalysis with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hemogsis in the treatment of an overdose is because Aripiprazole has a high plasma connection.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and Bipolar-I disorder is communicated to the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptor and a antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptor.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3 receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrengen and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripiprazole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy subjects showed a dosism dependant reducing the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at Nucleus caudatus and on the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half-idol-controlled study in Week 52 of the response of response to study employed in both groups were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measuring instruments which have been defined as secondary studies including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- depression scale, showed significantly stronger recovery than with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study about 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction of the decline rate found at 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% were below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study of schizophrenia over 26 weeks that included 314 patients and in which the primary study 'weight gain' was significantly less patients gain weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) at an average weight of about 5.6 kg.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled physiotherapy studies with more flexible dose over 3 weeks involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed up a placebo over 3 weeks against placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled physiotherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placeboy and active-controlled monotherapy studies in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole showed a degree of placebo over a week 3 and an exhaustive effect which was comparable to the lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aripiprazole noted in 12 a comparable proportion of patients suffering from symptomatic remission of mania, such as lithium or semi-idol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder, which were partly over 2 weeks in therapeutic serum, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole revealed a superior efficacy in reducing natural symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in certain patients who had achieved margins with Aripiprazole compared to placebo was superior to placebo in regard to prevention of a bipolar return, primarily in prevention of a decline in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes responsible for dehydration and hydroxyzole is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination bracket is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole using Extensive Metabolism of CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours at 'bad' (= "poor") metabolites over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, equally among the pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A popularisation-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics revealed no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic features of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study of subjects with different grave liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function to pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of class C, which does not suffice to draw weight on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated gift, reproduction, genotoxicity and the potential potential, pre-clinical data had no specific dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions, which have exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects reversed a dosisdependant side-toxicity and / or parenchymcell loss) in rats after 104 mg / kg / day (corresponds to the recommended maximum dose for humans) and combined ancellor recurrence / carcinoma at female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (which mean 10 times the middle steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans.</seg>

<seg id="98">However, the concentrations found at the highest average daily dose of 30 mg found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of hydroxy- Aripiprazene no more than 6% of the concentrations that were found in the study more than 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys, and lie well below limit values (6%) in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed according to dosages which led to expositions of 3- and 11,000 of the middle steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules that promotes the combination of microtubules from the Tubulindians and stabilised the microtubules by inhibiting their deolymers.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a inhibiting of the micro-dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network that is essential for the vitational interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin conveys transocytosis of the endothelial cells in the endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies has been demonstrated that the presence of Albumin is promoting the transport of paclitaxel by the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transitometry transportation is mediated by the gp-60 albuminous receptor and due to the albuminous Proteins SPARC (spleen protein acidic rich in cysteine) occurs a paclitaxel accumulation in the field of tumors.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single-blind, blinded studies and 454 patients treated in a randomized Phase III study study.</seg>

<seg id="361">Treatment with Abseamed must be run under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases, which the medicine is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and patients who want to refrain from their own blood circulation, Abseamed is injected into a vene.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be performed by the patient or of its support, provided that they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or patients who received chemotherapy should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per year of adults, respectively between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients have to be controlled in order to ensure that no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be given during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who received chemotherapy or patients with kidney problems, an anaemia can be caused by a erythropoietinmangel or by means that the body does not provide sufficient to the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>

<seg id="387">A rise in hemoglobins in order to be avoided by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in one patient or under the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of these hemoglobin variability, the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l) should be reached.</seg>

<seg id="652">Reduced Clearance by using cytochrome P450 enzymatic substances is unlikely because zoledronylic acid is not metabolic, because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, fuel-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) the renal Clearance of the Zoledronic acid correlated with the creatinine-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinine-Clearance, and amounted to 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">From this results that a light (clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the Zoledronic acid require.</seg>

<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated applications, which exceeded the maximum of human exposure, toxicological effects in other organs, including Gastrointestinal tract and the liver, and at the intravenous injection process.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common findings with repeated application was an increased primary Spongiosa in the metaphyse of the long bones with animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a fertilization that reflects the pharmacological, antiresortive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats, there is a teratogenicity of doses ranging from 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such skeletchets.</seg>
<seg id="662">Rabbits received no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects, although maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0,1 mg / kg due to resulting serum-calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European public report report (EPAR), explained as the Committee for Humanitarian Assistance (CHMP) to obtain recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Acetone is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes) in patients (particularly overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetesmedication) cannot be used together with other diabetes medicine (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can also be used in addition to metformin patients (particularly overweight patients) that can not be satisfactory in the highest tolerable dose alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphil resin or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonyl harnsubstance or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of sulfonyl hardening and insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin is better utilized and the blood sugar levels decreases, reducing type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acetone in tripletherapy was investigated; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphoneme, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glyphylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) measured how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value indicating that the blood glucose levels were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy trial, the effect of an additional gift from Actos to existing treatment with metformin and sulfonyl harnates in a lowering of HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo resulted in a lowering of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study where the combination of acetone and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin measures, compared with 0.14% decrease in patients who took placebo in addition to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were vision disorders, infections of the upper respiratory tract infections, weight gain and hypothesia (diminished sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos is not allowed to be applied in patients who may react sensitively to Pioglitazone or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketones).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos in the context of a monotherapy (in the sole use) is intended to serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients, where Metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a approval for placing of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and carry on one side the marker "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient insufficient and in which metals is inappropriate due to contraindications or incompatibly (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years no data is available, so the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are jeopardized by the presence of a risk factor (e.g. former heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treating the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema, if Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macular disease was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in failure reports on heart failure, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver disease (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range increases, the liver enzymic values are as soon as possible to control.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that prove on a hepatic dysfunction, such as unclarified nausea, vomiting, thronyness, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark resins, are the liver enzyme values to check.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with pioglitazone should be continued until the presence of the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment should be conducted.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazon a dosisdependant weight gain has been proven, which can stir by grease deposits and in some cases linked with a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodilution, a minor reduction in the middle hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative trials with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobins by 3-4% and hematokrits by 3.6-4.1%) and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobins by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients who received pioglitazone as oral or triple-combination therapy with a sulfonyl harnant or as twin-combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dosing dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the introduction of the treatment with Thiazolidindions, including Pioglitazon, including pioglitazon, was reported on a occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct link between taking pioglitazone and the occurrence of maculaödems, but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of maculaödems when patients are reported about disturbances of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages undesired events in randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fraid incidence was 1.9 questionnaires per 100 patients treated with pioglitazone to be treated with pioglitazone for women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patients who were treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROACTIVE study, a study about 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patients), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patients) in patients who were treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient wants a pregnancy or entering this, the treatment is decreasing (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on investigating the interaction have shown that Pioglitazone had no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs which are registered by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptive, cyclosporin, calcium canalblocker and HMGCoA-Reductasemmer are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with the fibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC of Pioglitazon to increase the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a decrease in AUC by Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is attributable to treatment with pioglitazon which reduces the hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance from the parent, thus reducing the availability of metabolic substrates to the reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very frequent &gt; 1 / 10; frequent &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (from present data not invalable).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the lens and the lens indexes, as they are also observed in other hypoglycaemic active substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazone the three times the upper limit of the norm range is equally frequently due to placebo but more rarely than in comparative groups below metformin or sulfonyl harmaceration.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with advanced makrovascular disease the frequency of a severe heart failure was 1.6% higher than in placebo when Pioglitazone is bzed.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, it is rarely reported about heart failure in Pioglitazon but more frequently if Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in history.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of messages undesired events in randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone treated groups and over 7,400 patients treated in comparative groups treated in comparative groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the period of 3.5 years current PROACTIVE study, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) treated with pioglitazone patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, 180 mg / day were followed over seven days.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to have a activation of specific core conception (PPAR-γ)) which causes the animal model to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, grease and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucosess in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapy was continued over two years to examine the time up to the therapeutic efficacy (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the start of therapy, blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone at 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study more than 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient for optimum phase with insulin in inadequate, to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon reduced the average HbA1c - value by 0.45% compared to patients who continue to get insulin; Reducing the insulin injecting in the group treated with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over one year, there was a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / Kreatinin-Quotives compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week investigation on type 2 diabetic.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo a total plasma triglycerides and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- Cholesterinspiegel as well as minor, but clinically not significantly increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone decreased compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid, the total plasmatriglycerides and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo was not statistically significant increase in LDL Cholesterinspiegel while under Metformin and Gliclazid was observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the triglycerides, but also improved the postoperative triglyceride level, this also improved by an effect on the triglycerid absorption and also on the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROACTIVE study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing advanced makrovascular disease were randomized to either existing anti-diabetic and cardiovascular therapy for a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon is quickly absorbent, with the top concentration of a fixed pioglitazone in the case usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the M-IV contribution represents efficacy in about triple the efficacy of Pioglitazon whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction-studies, Pioglitazon had no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with the fibrosis (cytochrome P450 2C8-Inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or reduces the plasma centration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactive maroglitazone in humans the marker was found mainly in the fences (55%) and a lower extent in the Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination period of unaltered pioglitazone is 5-6 hours, and the total active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma centrations of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function as low as healthy subjects, but the rates of oral Clearance is quite similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, according to repeated administration, Plasmavolume augmentation, anaemia, reversibler, expressed excentric heart hypertrophie.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazone reduces the hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the parent, thus reducing the availability of metabolic substrates to the reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (with male rats) of the ublum epithelium induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of family-familial polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other Thiazolidindions led to an increased frequency of colonise.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and bear on one side the marking "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fraid incidence was 1.9 questionnaires per 100 patients treated with pioglitazone to be treated with pioglitazone for women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patients who were treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the PROACTIVE study, a study about 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patients), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patients) in patients who were treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study more than two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazone or Gliclazid were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, there was a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / Kreatinin-Quotives compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon did not only reduced the triglyceride level, but improved the postoperative triglyceride level, this has an effect on the tryglyzerid absorption as well as on the hepatic tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing the objective of their primary endpoint, not fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, accuarisation, coronarisation, coronarisation, coronarisation and reascularisation of leg arteries, lay the results close that taking pioglitazone are not linked to cardiovascular risk risks.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and bear on one side the marker "45" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of messages undesired events in randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years treated with pioglitazone and received more than 7,400 patients who received comparative medication, showed an increased incidence of broken bones in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the PROACTIVE study, a study about 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patients), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patients) in patients who were treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="832">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the triglyceride level, but improved the postoperative triglyceride level, this has an effect on the triglyceride absorption as well as to the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was tested in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancreas can not produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes in which the body is not able to use insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glyphylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks that shows how good blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane resulted in a decrease of HbA1c spider that hints that the blood glucose levels were significantly reduced like with another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Acetphane should not be applied in patients who may react sensitively to human insulin (allergic) or any of the other constituents.</seg>
<seg id="868">Furthermore, the doses of Actraphane may also be adjusted when it is administered along with a number of other drugs that can affect blood sugar (the full list is the package file).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Humanitarian Assistance (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Actraphane was against the risks of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted a approval to the Novo Nordisk A / S approval for placing Actraphane in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="873">Patients whose blood glucose can be significantly improved by an intensive insulin therapy, hypoglycemia-warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change regarding starch, mark (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, long-effective, long-effective insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, humanised insulin or insulin delivery method) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA compared to insulin origin) can result that a change in dosage is required.</seg>
<seg id="875">If the change of acetphane in patients is a dose customizable, this can be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients, hypoglycaemic reactions after a change of animal on human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling, the patient should go on several time zones, the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his doctor, since such trips can lead to other times, or have to be taken in other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">Therefore, the doctor must consider possible interactions in the therapy and should always ask for others by them in other medicines.</seg>
<seg id="879">4. hypoglycaemia, as well as hyperglycemia, which may occur with a non-controlled diabetestherapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemia can result in loss of consciousness and / or seizures, and with temporary disruptions of brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Disorders of the nervous system Gelegaccidentally - peripheral neuropathy A rapid improvement of blood glucose control can be associated with complaints which are known as acute painful neropathy and are usually reversible.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors, who are familiar with immunosuppressful therapy and treatment of transplantations, should dispose this drug or take changes in immunosuppressful therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of the Systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to transplants or to increased incidence of side effects, including under- or overimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; Modification of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the engaging control of one in the transplantation paper (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In a result of conversion to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dose of Adults should be primarily based on clinical assessment of adjusting and tolerability in individual cases and blood-level regulations (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from programming to Advagraf the Tacrolimus talks should be controlled from the changeover and over two weeks to conversion.</seg>

<seg id="1422">Other dose customizations may be required later, as the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of the patients after the transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of grafts using the orale Advagraf therapy should start at 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift to the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dose recommendation - conversion of programming on Advagraf must have a graft dose of twice daily dose of Programe capsules to one once daily intake of Adults, this changeover in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplant After a changeover of other immunosuppressants on Advagraf each day, treatment with the recommended initial initial dose for the prophylaxis of transplanting slip is to begin.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Transplant In adult patients who are converted to Adcamraf is an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day a day in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other grafts did not have any clinical experience with Advagraf at lung, pankreas- and intestinal patients, patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and at intestinal transplant receivers in a oral initial dose of 0,3 mg / kg / day and at intestinal transplant receivers in a oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose customizations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood levels in targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver function as a result of the dose required.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since kidney function do not influence the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it may be assumed that a dose of dose is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of kidney function (including a regular determination of the serum levels) is recommended, a calculation of creatine and monitoring of the body volume).</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion of ciclosporin on Advagraf At the conversion of a Ciclosporin on a Tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations to the valley mirror in the whole blood: the dose should be primarily based on clinical assessment of output and tolerability in individual case using full-blood clergo-mirror controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tacrolimus talks during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-mirror of Tacrolimus should also change according to conversion of programming to Advagraf, Dosiscustomization, changes of immunosuppressful therapy or even in the same use of substances that could change the Tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Adcamraf has a drug with a low Clearance, adaptations of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials make it possible that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the valley mirror does not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice the valley mirror of Tacrolimus lies in the whole blood in the first time according to liver transplants in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in adrenal and heart transplant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent heating therapy of liver, kidney, and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including transplants or other side-effects, which can appear in a row of tacrolimus under- or overexposition.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes in formulation or regime should only be performed under the engaging control of one in the transplantation paper (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft shock absorbing, which has been proven to other immunosuppressants, yet there are no clinical data for retardated formulation of Adults.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For the prophylaxis of grafts at adult heart grafts and graft recipients in childhood memories are still no clinical data for the retardated formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that may lead to a degradation of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weaker of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements, the St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) is included, or other plantings during a treatment with Adults (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered where the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, it was considered a cardiomyopathy described chamber or septum hypertrophie, which can therefore also be found under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an existing heart disease, a treatment with cortisteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver disorders, infections, fluid load and oils.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of malignant skin changes caused by suitable clothing or use of a solar protection.</seg>
<seg id="1448">When patients take the Tacrolimus, symptoms for Pres such as headache, change consciousness state, convulsions and blurinal disorders should show a radiographic examination (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicinal products known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and reduce the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore, it is recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood mirror with the same gift of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and therefore represent the taco dose to maintaining even higher concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A highly pronounced interaction was used with timtimycotic such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and Vorosacol, and with the Macroeyelid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV proteasemakers (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the rise in blood levels mainly from the increased oral bioavailability of Tacrolimus, caused by inhibiting gastrointestinal degradation.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High-dose prednisolon or methyl prednisolon, as it is used in acute removal actions, can increase the concentration of Tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; hence the simultaneous use of Tacrolimus with medicines which are used by CYP3A4, whose metabolism is affected.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus put down the Clearance of Steroid contraceptive a and thus increase the hormonal exposition, it is particularly cautious when decisions on receptive measures are particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that Tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of Pentobarbital and phenazon, and extend their half-value days.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a minor number of tests on transplantations provide no indication that under Tacrolimus compared to other immunosuppressants, an increased risk for unwanted events in regard to the course and result of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high bond of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, Tacrolimus is not dialyzed.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The effect of action and pharmacodynamic effects on molecular level must be conveyed through the effects of Tacrolimus by its binding to a cytosolic protein (FKBP12) which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cellular nucleus.</seg>

<seg id="1480">Published results of the primary immunosuppression with Tacrolimus in the form of twice daily used programme Prograf has developed into a recognized primary immunosuppressant according to pancreas, lung and intestinal transplantations.</seg>
<seg id="1481">175% of the patients were subjected to a pancreatic transplant in 475 patients and deployed in 630 cases after an intestinal transplant as primary immunosuppressant.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral programming in these published studies gave the observations into the major studies where programming in liver, kidney and cardiac transplant recipients were applied to the primary immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In a intermediate analysis of a recent survey, multi-center study with oral programming has been reported on 110 patients who received either Tacrolimus or Ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 Randomization.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft damage, bronchiolitis inciterative syndrome, was less frequently observed in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after a year was 80.4% in the Tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">Patients treated with Tacrolimus patients in 21.7% of cases to the emergence of a bronchiolitis in comparison to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be converted to Tacrolimus (n = 13), was significantly bigger (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who were given by Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there came to no acute transplanting was after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%), patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study the frequency of emergence of a bronchiolitis is inciterative, among the patients treated with Tacrolimus patients was significantly lower.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multi-centric study with oral programming has been carried out on 205 patients simultaneously, which had been carried out simultaneously a pankreas- and kidney transplantation that were received after a randomized process Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (per protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was later reached to reach the stricken valley mirror of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Intestinal transplantation The published clinical results of a monocentralised study of oral transplants showed at 155 patients (65 only intestines, 75 liver and intestines and 25 multivisceral transplantations) under Tacrolimus and Prednisone an updated survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early identifying Epstein-Barr (EBV) and CMV infections, bone martial augmentation, lower initial doses of Tacrolimus, which lead to tales between 10 and 15 ng / ml and the latest graft radiation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as a low hematocrate value and low protein concentrations, leading to an increase in the inbound faction of tacrolimus, or due to treatment with cortiskosteroids are to be responsible for the increasing higher Clearance rates following the transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This makes it possible that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolic before the excretion, whereby the excretion is mainly carried out on the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients receiving programs (twice daily) at Adults (once daily) at Adults (1: mg: mg), the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was reduced to almost 10% lower than under programming.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tacrolimus talks during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 For the treatment of adult patients with transplantation, which proved to be treated with other immunosuppressants, yet there are no clinical data for retardated formulation of Adults.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advances will be used to treat bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a defect caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">Dosage and frequency of application be treated, whether it is applied to the treatment of bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood coagulation problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but according to a method known as "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) introduced it to the formation of human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advantages are approved by another in the European Union called Recombinate, but it is otherwise manufactured, so the drug contains no animal protein and animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of patients with severe and severe hemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the use of the medicine was studied in the prevention of bleeding and surgical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of Advations in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood clsepisodes with "excellent" or "good" assessed.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advantages (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, Pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advantages may not be applied in patients who may be insensitive (allergic) against human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or one of other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG approval for introducing Advances to the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of the substituion therapy are aligned with the severity of factor VIII-deficiency, after the place and the extent of blood flow and clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not drop under the given plasma seal (in% of the norm or in i.e., / dL).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection all 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) to repeat 3-4 days or longer, until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection all 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During treatment, to control the dose of the dose and incidence of injections an adequate determination of factor VIII-PlasmAccelerates.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and show different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. factor VIII per kg of body weight during 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not ruled with a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out if necessary to detect a inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so other therapeutic interventions must be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The administration speed should be addressed after the patient's desire, whereby a maximum injection of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complications of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always directed against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII, IgG Immunglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) pro ml plasma by modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors, correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk is dependent on the biggest 20 exposition days and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposition and anamnestically known inhibitory development, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, reoccur from (lower) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women there are no experiences about factor VIII during pregnancy and breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs in the largest number of patients suffering from factor VIII (5 patients) who had previously untreated patients that have increased risk to the formation of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very frequent (≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10), frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency on the basis of available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of individual patients (234). (b) The unexpected drop of the blood stream factor VIII-Spiegels occurred postoperatively (10-14 post-operative day) in one patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">The blood coagulation was maintained during the whole time and both the factor VIII- mirror in plasma and the Clearance rate showed adequate values on the 15th post-operative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavier hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and prior exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days), only one patient showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, there was none of the 53 päatric patients with an age of 6 years and diagnosed heavier hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) following previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days) a FVIII-Inhibitor observed.</seg>
<seg id="1562">In the previously untreated clinical trial, 5 of 25 patients (20%) treated patients with ADVATE treated patients to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend towards anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise no symptoms or symptoms, which referred to an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients agreed on the occurrence of Urtikaria, Pruritus, rash and increased number of osophinophilic grenulotes in several repetitive product positions in the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data for the first time, the CHMP has also been reviewed the benefit risk provisions as a positive, but in consideration that the safety profile may be closely monitored for following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, CHMP is based on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which makes an submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the registration owner has to apply for another 5 years further extension.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited adopted the Committee for Humanitarian Assistance (CHMP) officially that the company receded its application for the placing of Advexin to the treatment of Li-Fraumeni-Cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, bones or soft parts (tissues, the other structures in the body connects, surrounds and backs) of them.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus, which has been genetically modified, that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus" that has changed so that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore no infection can trigger in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexchanges should be injected directly into the tumors and enable the cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced by the undefective in the human body have an existing p53 gene, usually contributes to the restoration damage DNA and to kill the cells, if the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni-Cancer with which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein is not working properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company laid data from a study in a patient with the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of underbuilding, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had checked the answers to the questions concerning him, some questions were unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the evaluation of the initial documents, CHMP was created on Day 120, a list of questions which is sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP opinion not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexchanges in Li-Fraumeni-Tumors offer advantages for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns relating to the processing of medicine in the body, the type of administration and the security of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexchanges can be made in reliable ways, and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in enrich contact with the patient, harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know the CHMP to know whether the withdrawal for patients who are currently in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"modified active release" means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components immediately and the other slowly released over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, through an allergy to pollen caused by inodor inflammation of the nose) in patients with nose droplet (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents 12 years, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and end, once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nose mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the medicine can be found on constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main actual measurements were the changes in the gravity of the hay fever symptoms that were reported from the patients prior to treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients showed their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scala, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">Considering all of the hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose reported the patients, the Aerinaze's income, compared with a decrease of symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients who are pseudoephedrin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal smucosa was considered, the patients below Aerinaze showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who received disloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients), tachoneness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (loss of appetite), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (drowsiness), insomnia and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be applied to patients who may be insensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or one of the other ingredients, to adrenerous agents or Loratadine (another medicine for the treatment of allergies) are not used.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze can also be applied in patients that suffer from a bottlenticular glaucoma (high blood pressure), hyperthyresis (hyperthyroid), hyperthyresis (hyperthyroid disease), or already having a hemorrhagic stroke (caused by a brain bleeding) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted SP Europe authorization to launch an Aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, to swallow a whole (i.e. without them to crush or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should be applied to children under the age of 12 due to the failure of data for unquestionable and effectiveness (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after desks of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, because in long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrine can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Depending on the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory system, treatment with desloratadine can be continued as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine, the drug is also contraindicated in patients that are treated with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor and within 2 weeks after the completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity of combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstries such as Bromocripitin, peregiamin, oligamine, oihydrootamine or other decreontiva, phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxygenolin, naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient collective, and the data is not enough to address appropriate recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and the efficacy of Aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function, and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">The patients must be informed of that treatment in the occurrence of hypertonia or tachycarat or pitations, heart rhythmias, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or gain of headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">The treatment of the following patient groups is advised to be careful: • Patients under digital disease • Patients with arrhytharrhythmia • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the history of history, diabetes mellitus, bladder halsobum, or bronchospasmus in the history of history.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze can prevent at least 48 hours before the implementation of dermatological tests, because Antihistamine tend to prevent positive reactions on indicators for skin reaction or in their magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadine, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given, however, no clinical relevant interactions or changes of the plasma centration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">For the results of the psychomotor tests did not have any significant differences between those treated with disloratadine and placebo-treated patients, regardless of whether Desloratadin alone or with alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadine has not been identified yet, so that interaction with other drugs can not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadine inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 product is not inhibit and neither a substrate of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The inconcubility of the use of Aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to frequency in normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies in animals are not always transferred to humans and due to vasoconical characteristics of pseudoephedrine should not be applied in the pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, the patients should be clarified, however, that in very rare cases it may come to a drowsiness, which can lead to an impairment of traffic noise or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, diminished mental attention, cyanosis, coma, heart-circulation) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible letals.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, frightening micro, muscle weakness, arousal failure, nausea, vomiting, preventive pain, nausea, vomiting, preventive pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, vision and hypertonia or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is especially likely in children as well as atrophy-typical symptoms (mouth drying, pupil stiff and dilatation, skin erythema, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibitor of the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophile as well as the inhibiting of the expression of the adolescence P-seless on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study of adults, Desloratadadin showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of flux, including reinforcement of subjectivity or the tasks that are connected to flies.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, at recommended dose of 5 mg, no increased frequency of drowsiness was detected compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardial or manifestations of a CNS excitation.</seg>
<seg id="1693">In the age of 12 and 78 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis took part in the age of 414 patients with Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine-agonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets, determined by the total score for the symptom (except scentric mutilation), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine above the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets in terms of weakening effect, determined using the nasal scentric mutilation, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadine on the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow-weight of Desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and Pseudoephedrine was reached in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multi-dosisstudy that was carried out with the formulation as tablet to healthy adult subjects was found that four volunteers disloratadine badly misused.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A components of interact study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of Pseudoephedrine after the sole gift of Pseudoephedrine in bioequivalent was exposure to the gift of an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity, toxicity, and reproduction systems, pre-clinical data with Desloratadin may have no particular dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally consistent with the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive-based studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was administered in the oral gift to rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Since March 2007 and in module 1.8.1, the authorisation application is established and works and works, before and while the product is based on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to alleviating allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance that can unfold its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as rivets, ongoing or juckling nose, or lashing eyes with simultaneous constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms (itching, number and size of addling, impairment of sleep and efficiency) before and after six-week treatment was determined.</seg>
<seg id="1724">There were further studies presented to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to inhaling and the melting tablets in the same manner as the tablets and the use of children unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">Allergic rhinitis took place when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius to an average decrease of the symptoms of 12 to 26% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urtikaria, the decrease of the symptom took to six-week treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to 40 and 33% compared to placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be applied in patients who may be insensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, Loratadine, or one of other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted SP Europe approval for placing Aerius to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with a or without a meal, to alleviating symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see under Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience from clinical trials for the use of desloratadine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous disease and can end after the end of the symptoms and resumed in their resentment.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) the patient can be recommended for a constant treatment during allergies.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interaction were not found in clinical trials with desloratadine tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, taking Aerius and alcohol consumed the effective effect of alcohol (see under Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, the patients should be clarified, however, that in very rare cases it may occur in very rare cases, which can lead to impairment of traffic light or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius than in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events that were reported more frequently than the placebo was drowsiness (1,2%), mouth dry (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common adverse event was headache, these stood at 5.9% of the patients treated with desloratadine and 6.9% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study where up to 45 mg of desloratadine (Neunfold clinical dose) were given, no clinical-relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophile as well as the inhibiting of the expression of the adolescence P-seless on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical study with multiple outlets, in the distillatadine at a dose of up to 20 mg. daily administered over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study in the desloratadine at a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold of the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, there was no extension of the QTc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dosing study, Desloratadadin showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of flux, including reinforcement of subjectivity or the tasks that are connected to flies.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in treating the symptoms such as kidney, nostrils and itching of the nose, itching, lacriitence, and redness of the eyes, as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification of saisonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown by the total score of the quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces inseasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria has been ascertained for further forms of Urtikaria, since the underlying pathophysiology has been identified regardless of the etiology in different forms and chronic patients can be recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine is an active factor in all urticular diseases, desloratadine is also expected to improve symptoms in other forms of Urticaria in other forms of Urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and lowering size and number of portions at the end of the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamine in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of the patients who did not react to antihistamine from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the skin irritation by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadine patients compared to 19% treated patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and wax significant, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluation of these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which the patients were comparable with the general seasonal rhinitis -population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no monitoring points for a clinical-relevant cumulation after once daily application of DESloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days ahead.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadine is still not identified, so that interaction with other drugs are not completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadine uninhibits in-vivo not CYP6 and in-vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 product is not inhibit and neither a substrate of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dosisstudy with Desloratadin in a dosage of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, low-calorie-rich breakfast) does not affect the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical trials performed with Desloratadin and Loratadin who showed a comparable degree of exposure of desloratadine, no qualitative or quantitative differences in terms of toxicity profiles of DESloratadine and Loratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated gift, genotoxicity and reproductionxizity, pre-clinical data with Desloratadin may not recognise special dangers for human beings.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius may be taken independently of meals, to alleviating the symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see under Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The missing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by infection (see under Section 4.4) and that there are no data, which support a treatment of infectious rhinitis in Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomic anomalies, the diagnosis, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory and laboratory studies should play a role in diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years on denloratadine limited and experienced a higher frequency load (see under section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of aserius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, the restricted metabolic rate is identical to children that are normally metabolic.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-gactose absorption or sucrose-isomaltase- insufficiency of this drug should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interaction were not found in clinical trials with Aerius tablets which were given to erythromycin or ketoconazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, taking Aerius tablets and alcohol consumed the effective effect of alcohol (see under Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">Overall incidence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius Sirup group as compared to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius than in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents, who were given up to 45 mg desloratadine (Neunfold clinical dose), no clinical-relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 years, who came to an antihistamine therapy, received a daily Desloratadindoorsis of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desloratadin in adults and children, the efficacy data of Desloratadin in adults can extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">As part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in which Desloratadin in a dose of up to 20 mg used daily for over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharma-pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in which Desloratadin in a dose of 45 mg per day (the Neunfold of the clinical dose) was applied for ten days in adults, no extension of the QTc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents, no increased frequency of drowsiness was detected compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">For a single-day dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets performed surgery in adults and adolescents in clinical trials for no impairment of psychomotor.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu, which is caused by the flu virus (type) H5N1 of influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine, which might cause a strain of influenza virus, which might cause a future pandemic to protect.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of influenza virus appears easily by human being able to spread human beings, because humans still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "after administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the influenza virus, as" "" "physically aliend" "" "and forms antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is able to form a rapid antibody in contact with a flu virus of this Stamina.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which recognizes the human body as a body-foreign), cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study participants showed that the study was not carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">Thus, the scope of clinical data base for evaluating security of the vaccine does not suffice to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1906">The medication should then be prescribed if the doctor has tested the antiviral medication of the patient previously used, and the likelihood judged that the virus will address the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with 100 mg of knights and other antiviral medicines twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of carpentase is set up after body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agitation decreased in combination with other antiviral medicines the HIV amount in the blood and holds them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS does not cure diseases, however, damage the immune system and thus contributes to the development of HIV-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agrotase was investigated in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without knights, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously been treated with Proteasemakers.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This with low dose of phoncavir increased drug Azoase was compared with 206 adults, who had previously taken proteasure inhibitor, with other protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main indicators for effectiveness was the proportion of patients with not detectable levels of HIV in blood (viral load) or the change of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies involving patients who had previously not taken proteasase inhibitor, had a viral load below 400 copies / ml than under Placebo, but Aprase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase had also been the viruslast, but with the children who were previously treated with Proteasemakers, only few of them spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with Proteasemakers, the viral load of the viral load after 16-week treatment is just as effective as other protagonists:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients suffering from HIV, which was resistant to four other proteasure inhibitor, it was under Azoonavir to a stronger waste of the viruslast after four weeks than in the patients receiving their previous proteasase inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of agony (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients), headache, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), rosea (nausea), vomiting, skin rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 agitation must not be applied in patients that may be insensitive to ambabor or one of other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Aagase should also be applied in patients, the St John's wort (a herbal supplement to treat depression) or pharmaceuticals, which are equally to be shed and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, in patients who are receiving agraase, the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), an osteoystrophy (symptoms of bone tissue) or an immunological activation syndrosis (symptoms of infection that are caused by the immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Humanitarian Assistance (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of agitate in use in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children were over four years compared to the risks.</seg>

<seg id="1924">Agrotase was originally approved under "extraordinary circumstances," as at the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited a approval for placing an Alevase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agrotase is in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, proteasemmer (PI) -predestined adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually Ageneric capsules are to be given to pharmacokinetic padding of ambabor together with low doses of rite caviar (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of ambabor should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of ambabor as a solution for insertion is 14% lower than one capsule; therefore, aggregate capsules and solution are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for agraase capsules is 600 mg ambabor twice a day together with 100 mg of knights twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>

<seg id="1939">Patients should be pointed out that aging or any other antiretroviral therapy are not leading to cure HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including the treatment of hydrogenase, does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Generally, Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C are treated with an antiretroviral combination therapy, an increased risk of liver interactions with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of an antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with existing liver function including an chronically active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunctions under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of hydrogenase and krononavir with fluticason or other glucose accumulation is not recommended, unless the possible benefit of treatment the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including morbus Cushing and supplementation of the tributary function weighs (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the degradation of the HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitor and Simvastatin is strongly recommended by CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of hydroastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended for increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International standardization ratio), methods are available to determine the substance concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients that take this medicine at the same time, agrotase may be less effective because of reduced plasma seal of ammonbr (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with ambabor, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive can be changed, however, the information is not sufficiently sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with ambabor, patients should therefore be monitored on oppiatrous symptoms, especially if there are still low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of toxicity, due to the possible risk of toxicity, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution by certain other patient groups.</seg>

<seg id="1957">At the time of the introduction of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infection that leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multi-factorial etiology is accepted (including use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoekarsis reported in patients with advanced HIV-disease and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width of agitate cannot be given at the same time using medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also substrates the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width alarrar must not be given together with drugs, whose active ingredients are primarily associated with CYP2D6 and are connected to increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in AUC by Ambabor which can lead to a virology and lead to a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the lower plasma level by a dose of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very frequently unwanted effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of ambabor can be humiliated through the simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the ambition are up mirror and, if possible, to check the viral load and lose the St John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose-adjustment for one of the medicine is not necessary if Nelfinavir is given together with ambabor (see also eclipse below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with ambabor capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg of Ambabor used twice daily and knights of 100 mg twice daily, which prove the effectiveness and integrity of this treatment schemes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% humiliated if Ambabor (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinviolr + 100 mg of knights twice daily) was given.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of ambabor in plasma, which were achieved during the combination of ambabor (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg chonavir twice daily), approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Ambabor (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of knights.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A recommended dosage for the simultaneous administration of Ambabor and Kaletra can not be given, however, it is recommended a close monitoring, as the effectiveness and unthinkable this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study used in combination with didano in combination with didanosin, however, because of the antacid component of didanosin is advised that the revenue of didanosin and agitate to lie at least one hour (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, there is no dose customizable in combination with amidavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with ecomintment in combination with ambabor and saquinviolr is not recommended, as the exposure of both proteasemakers would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapin to other proteasemmer and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin may possibly sink the serum concentration of Ambabor.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this drug should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable since delavird could be less effective because of the reduced and possibly subtherapeutic plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If this medicine be applied together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virology surveillance should be performed as an exact forecast of the effect of the combination of ambabor and knights on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous production of Ambabor and Rifabutin led to an increase in the plasma centration (AUC) by Rifabutin for 193% and thus increasing the side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, Rifabutin is required along with asgenerase, to reduce the dose of Rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is prescribed.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with ascertainase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma level of both drugs could be increased in the same administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fosampour and 100 mg of ketoconazole once a day resulted in an increase of Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and AUC (0%) compared to the value which was observed after 200 mg Ketoconazole once a day without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, if they are used together with carriase, possibly lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">These patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions that are associated with these drugs, if they are used in combination with arase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data from other protagonists, it is advisable that Antacids should not be taken at the same time as agraase, since it may come to resignation problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anticonvulsiva known as an enzyme inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbitepine), with ambepr can lead to a detection of the plasma seal of Ambabor.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentration of calcium channel blocks such as Amlodipin, dipin, Nicardipin, nifipin, nippin, nifipin, nippin, nippin and verapamil can be increased 10 by ambabor which may be increased by activity and toxicity of this drug.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous operation with ascertainties can increase considerably and increase with PDE5 inhibitors in connection side effects including hypotension, vision disorders, and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) were significantly increased over 7 days, while the endogenous cortisol had decreased about 86% (90% account interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous gift of aging with Ritoncavir is not recommended together with these Glukokorrhoids, unless the benefit of a treatment weighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent to CYP3A4, distinctive increases of plasma seal at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma imaging of this HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including a rhubarb olysis, the combined application of this drug is not recommended with ambabor.</seg>
<seg id="1991">There is a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations until stabilising the mirror, as the plasma centrerations of Cyclosporin, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased in the same term of ambabor (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Aprase cannot be used together with oral rdazolam (see section 4.3) while using the same application of agony with parenteral midazolam caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other proteashibitors indicate a possible increase in the Midazolam plasma concentration camp around 3-4 torrent.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is given together with ambabor, patients should therefore be monitored on oppiatrous symptoms, especially if there are still low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the very low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given, like ambavirir- dose to adapt if Ambabor is given at the same time with methadone at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1996">Simultaneous monitoring of warfarin or other oral anticoagulums along with Aarase, a increased control of INR (International standardization ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a weaker or reinforcement of the anti-thrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive is not predictable, hence alternative methods recommended for contraception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example, Desipramin and Nortryptilin) is advised by the same term of asgenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This drug may only be applied to the potential risks for the fetus during pregnancy only after the pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lacuning rats, Ambabor-related substances were detected, however, it is not known to whether Ambabor in human breast milk are over.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study of airborne rats which was given to the uterus at the end of the breastfeeding of the uterus to the end of the breastfeeding Ambabor, during the standstill a diminished increase of 12 body weight during the retirement age.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive ability was not affected by the administration of ambabor on the parent.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The incordiality of Agenerase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Aarase treatment were slightly until moderate, they rose early and led rarely to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clarified whether they are used in connection with the medication or other at the same time for HIV-treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the core condition.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the above-mentioned side effects were obtained from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with Proteasemers were not treated twice a day twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4) that were weighted by the examination as related to the study mediation and occurred in more than 1% of the patients, as well as the treatment of treatment courses (Grade 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and severe lower fat tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophie of the breasts and dorsovikish fat accumulation (spikes).</seg>
<seg id="2009">At 113 antiretroviral not previously treated persons, with ambaboo in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudin had been treated in over a medium period of 36 weeks, was only a case (stir) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the PROAB 3006 study performed in 245 NRTIER pretreated patients under Ambabor 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients below indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a medium length of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0,001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin envelopes were normally slightly pronounced, erythematous or maculopapulous nature, with or without itching and came spontaneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks, without the treatment with ambabor had to be broken.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteosteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors, advanced HIV-disease or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immunodeficiency, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infection (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">Patients treated with PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg of agony twice a day together with low dose of side effects (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4), which were observed in patients suffering from triglyceride and CPK values, which were treated with low dosing cavioncaviar, very frequent.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of a transfer the patient is based on signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supportive measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Ambabor binds to the active centre of HIV-1 protease and prevents the process of essively viral gag- and Gag-pol- Polyprotein. as a result of a formation of unripe, non-infectious Virusparls.</seg>
<seg id="2017">Antiviral activity in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated in both acute and chronic lymphoisters cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmeric concentration (IC50) of Ambabor is in the range of 0.012 to 0,08 µm for acute infected cells, and is 0,41 µm with chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of ambabor against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication when human is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral not pre-treated patients with the currently licensed Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other knights onavir treatment schemes - the mutations described by mutations were seldom observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen of 434 antiretroviral patients, 700mg of Fosampour received 100mg ofravioline twice daily in the study ESS100732, a virological failure could be studied until week 48, whereby 14 isolates could be genotyped.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypical analysis of the isolation of 13 out of 14 children who included a virological failure within the 59 patients who were not treated with Proteasemakers, showed resistance pattern that were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K33F, V32I / L, I47V, G34V, D60E, I62V, A71V, V77V, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and their extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosampour / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) in patients with cervical inhibitors in patients with virology errors more than 96 weeks, the following Proteasemmer mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypical resistance based analysis, genotypic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Ambabor / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasure inhibitor resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defined resistance as the presence of mutations V32I / I, L33F, M36V, I54A / C / S / S / T / V, I54A / C / G / S / S / S / W / V, I62V and L90M, or at least 4 of the following mutations at Fosamprenavir, with a reduced likelihood of a virology response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutations, changes can be subject to additional data, and it is recommended to always attract the current Interpretation systems to analyze the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on pheotypic resistance based analytics-based phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with genotypic data on the estimate of activity of Ambabor / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasure resistance to isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies using diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (separating points) for FPV / RTV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to ambabor associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross-resistance to Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinviolr however remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data to cross-resistance between Ambavir and other protagonists for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral patients, one of them showed an resistance to Lopinviolr and Saquinviolr (one of 25 Isolate), Darinviolr / Ritonavir (three out of 25 insane), Lopinviolr / Ritonavir (three out of 24 Isolate), Saquinviolr (three out of 24 Isolate), Saquinviolr (three out of 24 Isolate) and Tidencavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Vice versa, Ambabor retains its activity against some other proteasase inhibitor resistant insulates; obtaining these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early termination of a reconciled therapy is advised to hold the accumulation of a variety of mutations in boundaries which can react to the following treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The proof of the efficacy of agony in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which PI pretreated to virology (100 mg twice daily) and nucleosidanalogy (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SoC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dosing ritual.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threundsixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to agraase, at least one of the PI and at least one NRTI were included in the A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis represented the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SoC PI group in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-leeve shaft of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The proof of the efficacy of non-bent Awarase is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 with PI were treated.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Ageneric solution was assigned to intake and capsules in dosages of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosisted Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients included a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml at a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these data, the treatment optimisation should be considered at PI pre-treated children of "unbleoodie" athemase.</seg>
<seg id="2043">According to oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) up to the maximum serum concentration of ambabor about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, reduced by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was given together with ambabor (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of ambabor with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of ambabou 12 hours following dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the food intake, although the equivalent of the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distributor volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg) and lets up a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration of ambabor from the bloodstream into the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease of the concentration of active substance in plasma, with the amount of unconnected ambabor which represents the active share, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unconnected ambition remains constant, the percentage of the free active part of the free active part during the dosing intervals in the Steady State's total concentration in the area of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Thus, drug may be induced or absorb CYP3A4 or absorb a substrate of CYP3A4 with caution when they are given at the same time using carriase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of agraase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amyloavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambabor is from the solution 14% less bioavailability than taken out of the capsules; therefore, agony solution and agony capsules are not interchangeable at a milligrammar basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Even the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of kidney function is likely to be low on the elimination of Ambabor and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to ambabor plasma proteins, comparable to those who are obtained to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg ambabor twice daily without the same appointment of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies for the carcinogenicity of mice and rats appeared at male animals benigne hepatogenic adenomas in dosages, which were treated to the 2,0-fold (mice) or 3,8- fold (rat) exposure to the people, after twice daily gift of 1200 mg ambabor.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatogenic adenomas and carcinoma was not yet clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for human beings is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the present exposition data on humans, both in clinical trials and clinical use, however, little evidence of the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames-test), mouse lymphoma test, was included in rats and chromosome aberration to human peripheral lymphocytes, ambabor was neither mutanodized nor genotoxically.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored in clinical everyday life with AST, ALT, and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">So far, no significant liver toxicity was observed in clinical trials, neither during the administration of Azoase nor after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young, which were treated from an age of 4 days, showed a high mortality rate in both the controls and with ambabor animals.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systematic plasmaexposition, which was significantly higher (rabbits) or significantly higher (rats) as the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage, however, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and minor skeletal changes were observed, which point to a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If aistasy capsules are applied without the enhancing addition of Ritonavir (Boobs), higher doses have to be applied to agitate (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for agraase capsules is 20 mg ambabor / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg ambabor that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous application is to be carried out in patients with weak or weak liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International standardization ratio), methods are available to determine the substance concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2068">An increased risk of a lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and with pharmaceutical dependent factors such as a lasting antiretroviral therapy and related metabolic disorders associated with the metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in AUC by Ambabor which can lead to a virology and lead to a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">508% increases, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with ambabor capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>

<seg id="2234">A minimum systemic intake of the 5% Imiquimodine cream with the skin of 58 patients with acute keratose was observed in three times weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml at the application in the face (12.5 mg, 1 bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated obvious half-time period was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour period after the subcutaneous use in a previous study, which points to an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of Imiquimod was low and comparable to topical application on MC-diseased skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to healthy adults and adults with acute keratose or superfizial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study to dermal toxicity in the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study carried out no similar effects in the mouse over four months.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on the carcinogenicity of mice had no tumors at the application of three days a week.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but because Imiquimod has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutiny, is a risk for people due to the systemic exposure as very low.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, primarily the safety of the drug was investigated, however, its effectiveness was measured as well (by its effect on the reduction of gag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years Aldurazyme recorded the Gag concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children recorded a normal liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients), headache, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat-feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), tachycardial (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be insensitive to patients who are possibly highly sensitive (allergic) to laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will require all new information that may be well-known, check and update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will receive patients who observe Aldurazyme in terms of reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the European Commission to Genzyme Europe B.V. for the placing of Aldurazyme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using CHO-mammals (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indigenous to long-term enzyme therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a Muka ysaccharitin I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency), to treat non-neurological symptoms of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should take place in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient contributes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme may be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme may be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Treated with Aldurazyme patients can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any adverse events that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should also be controlled engmeshed, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be available in an adequate clinical environment in which revitational facilities will immediately be available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, we expect almost all patients from IgG antibodies to Laronidase, generally within 3 months of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution by using Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since a bit of experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a longer interruption, due to the theoretically increased risk of a hypersensitivity reaction has to be cautious after a disruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">Treat 60 minutes before the incinfusion of infusion with medications (antihistamine and / or anti-pyramifications) to minimize the potential appearance of infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of mild or moderate infusions, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen was needed and / or reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate when the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single, severe infusions, infusion has to be stopped, until the symptoms are brought to decline, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to consider.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be absorbed again with a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen / or corticosteroids) and a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain because a potential risk of interference with intracell inclusion in Laronidase exists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experiments are not allowed to direct or indirect damages to the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns, which were exponated opposite the breast milk, is recommended, while the treatment with Aldurazyme is not too quiet.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Side-effects in clinical trials were identified mainly as infusion-related reactions that were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted medication related to Aldurazyme, which were observed during the Phase 3 study and the extension of a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older with a total treatment duration of up to 4 years; frequent (≥ 1 / 10); frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation in the upper respiratory tract and lungs in history, severe reactions came out, including bronchospels, breathing difficulty and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children unwanted drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme who were reported during a phase of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly serious damage form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously one week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a seroconian version, with one of the patients aged under 5 years with a heavier deterioration in one month (on average after 26 days in patients at the age of 5 years and over).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the phase 3 study (or up to an early output from the study) in 13 / 45 patients had no detection antibodies (RIP) Assay detectable antibodies, among them 3 patients, where there was never been a seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of antibodies to low antibodies showed a robust reduction in the Gag spike in the resin, while in patients with high antibody tifications a variable reduction of gag in the Harn was noted.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal until low-neutral effect on enzymatic laronic activity in vitro, which seemed to be unaffected by clinical efficacy and / or reducing Gag in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of adverse reactions, even if the occurrence of adverse reactions coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The grounds for the encephalic therapy lies in one of the accumulated substrats and the prevention of a further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion laronidase is quickly removed from circulation and cells into the lymphosis, the most likely more than man-6-phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study involving 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients recruited for the study, which referred to the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients from the middle phenotype, and only one patient showed the serious phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expatriatory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">Primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in 6-minute walk-test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open label extension study where she received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme every week (182 weeks) every week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme treated patients across the placebo group to improve the lung function and the ability to be shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study, an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects can be seen from up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group as seen from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is clinically significant over this period of clinically significant and the absolute lung-volumes increased disproportionately proportional to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatomic figure reached 22 (85%) to the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">During the first 4 weeks a significant reduction in the gag mirror in Harn (µg / mg of Kreatinin) was observed, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease that takes into account the clinically significant changes for five efficacy variable (at least in the 6-minute walk, movement area of the shoulder-bearing AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A year-old open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined at 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old (16 patients with the heavy displacement form and 4 with the middle drop form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased due to increased GAG- mirror in the Harn in week 22 over the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients one size growth (n = 7) and weight gain (n = 3) was determined according to the Z score for this age group (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the middle comparing form a normal spiritual development speed, whereas only limited or even no progress in cognitive development were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations into pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme metamorous schemes were performed on the Gag mirror in the Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously one week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can result in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions, but it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two Dosizing Schemata is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will assess any new information that will be available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug may be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in one-time gift, toxicity in repeated gift and reproduction, pre-clinical data cannot recognize any special dangers for human beings.</seg>

<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetrexed thus slowed down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Converting Pemetrexed into its active form advances in cancer cells lighter than in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active time of cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant Pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was studied in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">For the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer the effects of Alimta have been treated in a study on 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which previously had previously been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of docetaxel (an other drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (other medicines for cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients who were treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived an average of 12,1 months compared with 9.3 months in the resulting application of Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy had an average survival time with Alimta 8.3 months, compared to 7.9 months at docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, patients with which the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells during the administration of Alima longer survival compared to the comparison medicine.</seg>

<seg id="2520">It is recommended to meet additional fluctuating measures aimed to prevent oral contraceptions possible in the event of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on interactions of medicines as well as in several cases, with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a reduction of ciclosporin plasma bars was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the use of warfarin or other oral anticoagulums in combination with orlistat, the Quick values could be influenced (internationally normalized ratio INR) (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">Most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with orlistat remained the concentration of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as the beta carotene.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, the patient should be recommended before bedtime a supplement of multivitamin prepared to ensure adequate vitamine (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the gift of an injection dose Amiodarone was observed with a limited number of volunteers who received orlistat at the same time, a minor decrease of the Amiodarone plasma centration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experiments showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and impose the pharmacological effects of the drug, as absorption of recorded fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg for a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The skins are defined as follows: very frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency on the basis of available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of the known side effects that were found after the launch of orlistat is not known, as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">+ It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to Beklemmings with regard to possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg of orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered daily over a period of 15 days, without any significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">At the majority of reported cases reported by orlistat overflow, either side effects or similar side effects as at the recommended dose of orlistat were reported.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, from a fast reversal system of Systemic effects, which are attributed to lipastizing properties from orlistat.</seg>

<seg id="2536">Clinical trials was derived from clinical studies that 60 mg of orlistat captured three times a day, the absorption of about 25% of the food.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m covers the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokaline, fettredued diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change of body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of the boundary), was assessed as follows: as alteration of body weight in the study (Table 1) and as a proportion of those who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the largest weight loss was observed in the first 6 months.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used for chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as Cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies, moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, dosxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an antiemetic medication).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under the age of 18 is not recommended, as to the effects in this age group do not have enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance stimulate the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are severe or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the strong triggers for nausea and vomiting showed, 59% of patients who were treated with Aloxi did not receive vomiting (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting showed that 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi were no vomiting (153 von 189) compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron patients (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison to Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted a approval to the company Helsinki n Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. an authorization for placing of Aloxi states in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a heavily emetogenic chemotherapy, can be strengthened by adding one before the corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Da Palonosetron can extend the thicket level, patients with anamnesty obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advisable in the same gift of Palonosetron with drugs which lengthen the QT interval or in patients, with which the QT- interval is lengthened or tend to tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with another chemotherapeutics-gift, Aloxi will not be used to prevent nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In clinical studies Palonosetron inhibited the activity of the five studied chemotherapeutics (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabin, dosxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a one-time intravenous dose Palonosetron and a steady high concentration of metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based on a population based pharmacokinetic analysis, CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Amiodarone, Celectrolyb, Doxorubicin, Fluoxetine, Chinidin, Ranitidin, nionavir, sertralin and terbinafin) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience to use Palonosetron in human pregnancies lie not before, so Palonosetron should not be applied during pregnancy, unless the doctor's doctor is considered necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common in clinical trials were observed in a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which were at least possibly with alogies, headache (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions at the administration location (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar bodies of adverse events showed themselves similar to adverse events such as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-active relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2629">There were no dialysis studies carried out due to the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably no effective treatment in a aloxir overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received rigid phosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 micrograms of Palonosetron were given to patients who received 32 mg of Ondansetron (half-value 7.3 hours), which was administered intravenously on Day 1 without dexamethone intravenous.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine and 250mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine, with patients compared to 32 mg of Ondansetron received intravenously 1 intravenous patients.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of pre-clinical studies Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels and repolarisation, and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted in 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the ECG-effects of i.v. abated Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous gift follows a long-term elimination of plasma-placements a slow Elimination from the body with an average of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma centration (Cmax) and the surface below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally examined in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 m / kg (kg) and cancer patients dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses laid out at 11 high-level cancer patients (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron plasma centration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations that at once daily intravenous intravenous injection of 0.25 mg Palonosetron reached the overall value of 0.75 mg of measured value; however, the Cmax was higher after the injection of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated via the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolism, which have compared to Palonosetron above less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours of urine, Palonosetron as an unaltered drug made approximately 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous boletus injection, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the full Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function are increased the terminale of elimination of elimination and the average systemic exposure with Palonosetron, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, effects were observed only after expositions, which are considered sufficient by the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10. clinical studies have shown evidence that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels, which are involved in ventricular deformation and repolarisation and lengthen the shareholder duration.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose of the therapeutic exposure of man), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumors, endothelium (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, tributary mark) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages and Aloxi used for a unique application, the relevance of these results will be low as for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Humanitarian Assistance (CHMP) passed a negative opinion in which the prescribed approval for the treatment for the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means alpheon was supposed to be similar to a biological medicine called Roferone-A which is similar to the same drug, which is already approved in the EU (also known as "reference assistant").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-persistent) Hepatitis C (one of liver disease caused by virus infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">During a microscopic analysis the liver tissue damage damage, in addition, the values of the liver enzyme Alanin- Aminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was brought to stimulate this to the formation of active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon introduced data that prove the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, security and efficacy of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with Hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared to the efficacy of Alpheon with efficacy of reference to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">In the study, as many patients were evaluated after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of treatment on the medicine (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: / / www.emea.eu.int (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or Distribution of this document is Authorised for non business attende. what were the greatest concerns which causes the CHMP to make the approval for placing on the market?</seg>
<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns expressed in detail that the data for the stability of the drug and the marketable disease were not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C dedicated to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A were similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon was retardant the disease in more patients than at the reference surgeon; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the study was used in the study to investigate the question, incorrect the medication is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be applied to the treatment of impetigo (one with crucifying education) and small infected Lazerations (Riss- or chives), detonations and sewn up wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used for treating infections, which have been proven to be proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because of the alarm against this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but patients under the age of 18 may not be compared to treated skin surface more than 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient is not addressing the treatment after two or three days, the physician should once again examine the patient and draw alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It acts with blocking of bacterial ribosomes (the parts of bacterial deposits in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">Main indicators of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was withdrawn after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients with placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">For the treatment of infected windows showed altargo and cefalexin similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together at Hautwood, about 90% of the patients of both groups were treated.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, Altargo has been detected in treating abscesses (eitfully filled hollow in body tissues) or infection, which have been proven to be proven or presumably by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is irritation at the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Humanitarian Assistance (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of altargo occur in short-term skin infections with the risks of the following superficial skin infections: • impetigo, • infected small ladeformations, loss, or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">The European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. in May 2007, the European Commission granted authorization for placing altargo to the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients, in which within two or three days does not show improvement, should be examined at once and an alternative therapy is considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of sensitization or severe local irritation by the use of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment is to be abolished, the ointment is carefully cut and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection are started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials for secondary infected wounds the efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant pile-hylococcus aureus (MRSA) were insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered, if after a 2-3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected spot occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of Retapamulin and other topical resources on the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinical-relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected due to the low plasma centration which were reduced to human skin or infected surface treatments (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous operation of 2 times a day 200 mg Ketoconazole increased the mean retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin salbe on reduced skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the minor systemic exposure after topical application in patients, dose customizations are not required if topical retapamulin applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive review of oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy, when a topical anti-bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retapamulin is to be preferred by a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether the breastfeeding continued / terminated, or the therapy with Altargo continued to be continued, is between the benefit of the breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials involving 2,150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo, the most commonly reported adverse effect of irritation at the administration meeting, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">The effect of action of retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of Phalromutilin, a substance that is isolated from fermentation from Clitopilot us passagerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckeranus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibition of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding point of the 50s subdivision of the bacterial rift, which differs from the binding other ribosomal interacting anti-bacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data suggest that the engagement of the ribosomes protein L3 is involved and in the region of the ribosomes P-bindings and the PeptidyltransferaseCenter.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Due to binding on this engagement, Plighromutiline avoids the peptidyltransfer, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If the treatment of retapamulin should appear in at least some information forms, advice should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity from Retapamulin towards S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of a failure to treat S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin was put daily under occlusion on intact and to restrict skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Out of 516 patients (adults and children), which received 1% Retapamulin salbe twice daily for 5 days to topical treatment of secondary traumatious wounds, single plasma samples were produced.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake at the people after topical application of 1% salts on 200 cm2 of reduced skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660-times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro review on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats-microkerntest to in-vivo study chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats signs of restricted fertilation at oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which achieves up to 5 times higher exposure when the highest estimated exposure of people (topical application on 200 cm2) was reduced to a reduced skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats were observed at oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above)), development of development (reduced body weight of fetuses) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of approval for placing the placing has to ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as specified in the 1.8.1 module, is present and works before the product is marketed, and as long as the product is marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of approval for placing on the office is committed to detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities, as they were accepted in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP), and in the module 1.8.2 of the authorisation application, as well as all additional updates by RMP, which are agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP's Guideline on Risk Management System for Human Rights, the updated RMP should simultaneously be submitted by the next periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms to be treated in the job, you should end the application of altargo and speak with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not use other salads, creams, or lotions on the surface that is treated with altargo if it is not expressly granted by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be used in eyes, mouth, or lips, or in the nose, or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment can be seen on one of these faces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor about advice, if discomforts.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After wearing the ointment you can cover the affected area with a sterile bandage or a gazelle tape, unless your doctor doesn't get to cover the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic cap, which contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminium bag, which contains 0.5 g ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases which affect the liver) in children between one and 15 years which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambient rix is applied as part of a two doses existing vaccination, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, ambirix are only allowed if during immunisation, a low risk of hepatitis B infection is ensured and ensured that the vaccine can be led up to the end of two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refractive dose for hepatitis A or B is desired, the ambirix or any other Hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccination works by bringing the immune system (the natural resistance of the body), "as it can resist a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Once a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and generates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the vaccine manufacturer Twinrix adults and the vaccine registered in 1997 Twinrix children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix are given an existing vaccine for three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because ambirix and Twinrix are also included identical substances, some of the data that supports the use of Twinrix adults, also as proof for use of ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicators for effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children, which had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibody concentrated.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six months and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children, Ambirix introduced a month after the last injection of anti-antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of ambirix was similar to a sixth and a 12-month distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection process, redness, matness (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambient is allowed in patients that may not be insensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or Neomycin (an antibiotic) not to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, i.a. a approval for the placing of ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the basic dimmisisation with ambirix consists of two vaccinations, with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refreshment is requested for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovarian vaccine or with a combination of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen - anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBC) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies lie in the same size as following vaccination with the respective monovarian vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully assured whether immune competent persons who have addressed a suspicion of hepatitis C, which may need to be protected as protection, as they may also be protected by immune memory through the immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3. as with all injection vaccine, the rare case of anaphylactic reaction should be available immediately after the gift of vaccines and monitoring possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is necessary, the standardization system is recommended using the combination of the combination of hepatitis B, which contains 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinable Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hematalysis patients with dysfunctions of immune system, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies are achieved so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since a intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could result in a suboptimal impact result, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, if Thrombozytopia or blood coagulation disorders can be injected by subcutaneous injection, as it may occur in these cases after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If ambirix was administered in the form of a separate injector at the same time with a combined diphtheria-, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or combined with a combined masre- mumps disease vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Immunosuppressant therapy or patients with immune defects have to be assumed that maybe no sufficient immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccine doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, valency, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever comparable to the frequency, which was observed in previous Thiomerang and preservative-based vaccine formulating.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines have been given to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-doses combination.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maturity based on a calculation basis per vaccination dose ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 57% of subjects, compared with 39.1% in subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle 66.4% of the subjects who had received ambirix were vaccinated over pain, compared to 63.8% of the subjects who have been vaccinated with the 3-dose.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The frequency of maturdness was comparable high (i.e. about the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of subjects who received ambirix compared to 36.2% of the subjects who received 3 doses of combination).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and consistency was low and comparable to that the combination of the combination of the combination of the combination with the 3-cans vaccine was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1--11-year-old vaccine, the occurrence of local actions and general actions in the ambient diagnosis was comparable to the hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinable Hepatitis B-Surface surface with 360 ELISA units.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, for the 6- to 11- year-olds, however, after vaccination with ambirix a frequently earlier occurrence of pain (at the injection process) per dose, is not reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines that reported over severe side effects during the 2-doses vaccination schemes with the combination of 360 ELISA- units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinable Hepatitis B surface antigen, was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical studies that were carried out at vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the serum rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6-suggested dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum rate for anti-hbs were 74.2% one month after the first dose, and 100% one month after the second, to the month 6 given dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of ambirix and 147 received the standard combination of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogeneity was evaluated, the serum rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3-dose of dose than with ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which were reached in a clinical comparison study of 1--11-year-olds, one month after the end of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccinations have received either a 2-doses vaccines with a combination of 360 ELISA units, with a combination of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinable Hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2767">At persons who were at the time of the basic idea between 12 and 15 years, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies could be detected on at least 24 months after immunisation with ambirix in the 0-6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response to both antigens was comparable to both antigens, which was formed in combination with a combination of 360 ELISA units, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitisan A-Virus and 10 µg recombinable Hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study of 12- to including 15-year-olds it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies 24 months after immunisation in the 0-6 months of vaccination is comparable to the vaccination of 0-12 months.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix was administered at the same time with the withdrawing of a combined diabetic, tetanus- and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b-vaccine (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study that was performed with 3 doses of current formulation in adults, showed similar formulation and serum samples like earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is also possible to investigate any external particles and / or physically visible changes after the reset.</seg>
<seg id="2773">According to Article 114 of the directive 2001 / 83 / EC, the state-of-state charms will be made of a state lab or any of this purpose authorized lab.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix cannot fully protect the infection with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus, even when the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you are infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus in before the administration of both vaccine doses have already been infected with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus (though you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill) a vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections which may cause liver damage or symptoms, which are similar to those of hepatitis B or Hepatitis B infection, can not be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If there is an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be expressed by itching skin rash, shortness or swelling of the face or tongue. • if a allergic reaction has occurred to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B once with you / your child. • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the planned administration of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from an inoculation with ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend to you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective stock levels (360 ELISA units of a formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content is usually given a month after the first dose to give you a vaccination protection before ending the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, amrix are injected by individuals who are suffering from serious blood clots, under the skin and not injected into muscle. • If you are weakened due to a disease or treatment in your body's body or if you / your child is underlining to a hemogalysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these persons can't be sufficient, so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Say to your doctor if you have to take a further medicine, (including those who have been vaccinated without prescription) or if you have been vaccinated prior to your child / has been given to immunoglobulins (antibodies) or planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">But it may be that in this case, the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient, therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with ambirix, should be vaccinated in separate places and possible at different limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If ambirix are to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Normally, amrix pregnant or lactating women are not given, except it is urgently needed that they are vaccinated both against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information on certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic) in your child.</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed time for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ very frequent (more than 1 case per 10 coated cans): • pain or complaints at inhalation or redness • headache • headache • lack of appetite</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs to 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which have been known since issuing the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP came to a positive opinion that the benefit-risk ratio for ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since ambirix was only transported in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the data security data are limited to this drug due to its small patient exposition.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonochrome may also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defective or with hyperammonia concentrations (brain damage due to high ammonials) in history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonschnaps - split by several single doses to the meals - swallowed, among the food mixed or over a Gastrostomy also (due to the abdominal wall in the stomach-leading hose) or a nostriprobe (through the nose leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">There was no comparative study because Ammonaps could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo (a placebo medicine, i.e. without substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonium may also cause loss of loss, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid rejection, taste problems or taste loss, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, unpleasant body odor, or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">At the end, the Committee for Humanitarian Assistance (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Ammoneyeseed in patients with disturbances of the body is effective to high ammonials.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonaps was approved under "extraordinary circumstances," due to the rarity of the condition at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients, with which a complete enzyme organ has already been manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-solid form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first phase of life) is an indication of the application if in the history of history a hyperammonic encephalopathy exists.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing problems, AMMONAPS is also available in granulatform.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated by the protein tolerance and the patient's growth and the development for daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0,17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early dimanifold deficiency of Carbamylphosphatsynthetase or Ornithintranamide.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an Argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency must get arginine at a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given patients with gorges, as a risk of the emergence of Ösophagusulzera exists if the tablets don't get into the stomach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore, AMMONAPS should therefore be used with counter congestive heart failure or severe renal failure and with sodium retention and edetion.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat is carried out on liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is unknown; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">At subcutaneous injection of phenylacetic to young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown of neurons and an increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It was also a delayed appeal of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be found if Phenylacetic will be eliminated in the breast milk and this is the use of AMMONAPS during the standstill counter (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients were at least an adverse event (AE) and 78% of these undesired events had assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anoretic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactate, severe hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose appeared in a 5-month old small child with a normal single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with accumulation of phenylacetic, which showed dosisecoxicity with an intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetic is a metabolic compound which conjugated by acetylacetylglutamine glutamine conjugated by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine with urea comparable (both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms); Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for the excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of urinary cycle can be assumed that, for each gram, sodium phenylbutyrat may be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis started early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifold form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infantry, and the disease carried out even in the treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with its sticking free analogy within the first year of life to death.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to haemalysis, the use of alternative pathway of nitrogen oxide (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium polyphenylacetic), proteins reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (however within the first phase of life).</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease had been diagnosed in the course of pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients with many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-solid form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygous form of ornithatopbamylase deficiency), which were recovered from a hyperammonic encephalopathy, which were treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing Neurological deficits are hardly reversibly and in some patients a further deterioration of the Neurological state may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacetic, which is conjugated in liver and kidneys with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were identified according to an individual dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in sober-free adults and in patients with disturbances of urine test, as well as repeated gifts of oral doses ranging from up to 20 g / day (not controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolism was also studied in cancer patients after intravenous injection of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetic.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablets, 15 minutes after intake measurement of phenylbutyrat was detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cyclic disorders (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) in the next morning after night fasting no phenylacetic was detectable in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis, which were repeated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the medium phenylacetate concentrations have been treated five times higher than the first gifts on the third day.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted within 24 hours about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus testing, sodium phenylbutyrat had no clastogenic effects treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is taken either by oral (infants and children who have not yet been able to swallow any pills, or patients with canybean disorders) or a nostria.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in plasma should be held within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0,17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early dimanifold deficiency of Carbamylphosphatsynthetase or Ornithintranamide.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyrat, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="2863">If a patient must receive the medicine via a probe, AMMONAPS can be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare cases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they accumulate the sticketing waste products based on the consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you are done with lab testing, you will need to inform the doctor that you may influence AMMONAPS, since sodium phenylbutyrat may influence the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other drugs please inform your doctor or pharmacists if you have taken other medicines or recently taken it, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the breastfeeding you may not take AMMONAPS because the medicine could go into the breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is applied for the treatment of adult patients with "acute retonarsyndromes" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example, in instabiler angina (a form of pain in the chest with varying strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "Stuplift" (an abnormal measurement of the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is applied to prevent blood clots in patients that interfere with a PCI is administered to a higher dose and infusion can be continued up to four hours after surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of ACS, with the effect of angiox in sole gift or in conjunction with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa-inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) with conventional combination therapy with heparin (another anti-coagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI was frequently a stent (a short tubes, which remains in the arteries to prevent a lock), and they received another drug on preventing blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">At the treatment of ACS was Angiox- with or without gift of GPI - following the prevention of new events (deaths, cardiac failures, or Revascularisation) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients suffering from a PCI was Angioxin relation to all indicators as effective as heparin, except for heavy bleeding, with which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox is not allowed to be applied in patients who may be insensitive (allergic) against bivalent (allergic) against bivalent (allergic) against bivalent (allergic) or any of other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It must also be applied in patients who recently had a bloodstream, as well as with people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Humanitarian Assistance (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Angiox is at the treatment of ACS and while a PCI is a acceptable replacement for heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission presented The Medicines Company UK Ltd. approval for placing onox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute retonarsyndromes (unstable Angina / non-ST-Hebdo infarction) (IA / NSTEMI), or if an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is a intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in another row, another bolt should be given up to 0.5 mg / kg and increases infusion for the duration of the intervention to 1,75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI in clinical conditions, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">An infusion of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered directly before the procedure, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the impact.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with a PCI is of 0.75 mg / kg bodyweight and one of these intravenous intravenous intrafusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The security and efficacy of a sole bolus gift of angiox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI surgery is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value is reduced to about 225 seconds, it should be reduced to a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">To reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and are administered intravenously intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, additional monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney disease (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which is subjected to a PCI (whether with Bivalirudine against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate should be used by 1.4 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg is recommended, and the ACT was again reexamined 5 minutes after the second bolt.</seg>

<seg id="2906">The patients are carefully monitored in treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when Bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anti-coagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if in case of PCI-patient under Bivalirudinal, most bleeding in the arterial puncture occur, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may occur during the treatment in principle everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking warfarin and treated with Bivalent (International standardization Ratio), a monitoring of the INR value (International standardization Ratio) should ensure that the value after the treatment with Bivalirudin should be achieved before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge about the mode of action of anticoagulcipes (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregates) it may be assumed that these agents increase blood danger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination with Bivalirudin with thrombocyte aggregates or anticoagulcipes, clinical and biological hemostasis are regularly controlled in any case.</seg>

<seg id="2922">In case of overdose, the treatment with Bivalirudin is immediately broken down and the patient engmeshed to monitor signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific Thrombinocular, which binds both at the catalytic center as well as at the animonment region of Thrombin, regardless of whether thrombin is tied in the liquid phase or at Gerinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to thrombin, and therefore its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin sanders slowly the binding of Bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4 slowly, thereby creating the function of the active center of thrombin regenerates.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, in the past, Bivalent Thrombocytopia / heparininduced Thrombocytopia / heparininduced Throbosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS) had come to induce no thromboatocyte reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, teenagers and children from six years with diabetes which require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, injected the thighs, or upper arm with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin for the control of glucose (sugars) in blood or process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs a very low of human insulin, and the change means that it seems faster and a shorter active time has become a short-effective human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in the use with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body can not produce insulin in two studies with a total of 572 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In case of type 2 diabetes, in which the body can not work effectively in effect, Apidra was studied in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicators for the effectiveness was the change of concentration of substance glyphylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed compared to a lowering of 0.14% in insulin delivery.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering the HbA1c concentration amounted to 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra should not be applied in patients that may be insensitive to insulin or any of other components, or in patients who have already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra possibly need to be adjusted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH approval for placing Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the Deltamusk or subcutaneous injections in the area of abdominal pain.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Because of the reduced glucose capacity and diminished insulin delivery, the insulin needs can be fixed in patients with a limitation of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of active strength, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin (normal, NPH, zinkdelayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or manufacturing method can attract a change of insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosage or removal of a treatment, especially in patients with insulin requiring diabetes, can lead to a hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these states are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin in another manufacturer should be done under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the effect of the insulin delivery and can therefore change the conversion of the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">In order to increase blood glucose monitoring and increase the inclination to hypoglycemia, oral antidiabetic, fibreads, dioxetine, monoamine oxidation, pentoxifiine, propoxylic acid, icylic acid and sulphonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Additionally, under the effect of sympatheolytics such as betablockable, Clonidin, Guanethidin and reserpine the symptoms of adrenergen to be weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experiments showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and humankind regarding the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known if insulin runs into human breast milk, but generally insulin does not occur in breast milk, nor is it resorised after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the previously undesired medicines in clinical trials and arranged according to system organs (very frequent: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency on the basis of available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold - welve, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, drowsiness, excessive dog, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Will fails to continuously change the injection of injection within the injection of injection, a lipodystrophy can occur at the injection process.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycopes with loss of consciousness can be given by a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg) which is given by a doctor or by intravenous administered by a physician.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose levels, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to prevent the Ur- cause for severe hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood glucose levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose (especially by skeletal musculature and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous Ga- be of insulin-effect occurs faster and the drug duration is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin-lulisin is a therapeutic dosing area of 0.075 to 0,15 E / kg a portion of proportional glucosity effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in the glucose reduction effect, just like humankind.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast impact impact as normal human insulin and generates a complete glucosity effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was clear that at an application of Insulinglulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable postponal glycaemic control is reached like with human normal insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulin isulisin 2 minutes before the meal was taken - a better postponsionate control than with human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal was reached.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Insulin is absorbed in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycemic control is used as in human normal insulin, which is 2 miths before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - previously) before the start of the meal was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the start of the meal (figure 1A), as well as compared to human antibodies that was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin delivery in gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after the beginning of the meal) after the beginning of the meal, was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before the beginning of the meal (figure 1C) before the start of the meal.</seg>
