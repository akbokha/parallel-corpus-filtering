the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its low size , they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some functions of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; by providing these lighter available .
for more information about the use of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to upload these modules in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select settings extensions .... open the map tools and select the selected modules here .
this is a list with standard input modules from the K@@ DE ; Ad@@ d@@ ons package . please note that maybe more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; it contains before you comp@@ ile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; check the page on Extras . then you can view the page , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; for the crash , or the list of crash@@ es , if present , er@@ ase .
the module is listed in the module ( also called folder filters ) in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras . with the module you can filter &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; it is current directory of different type filtering .
to view the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree @-@ tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M &apos;s just displayed website . as default , the document begins with the root notes of the document , example : an element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root canal .
the module &amp; FS@@ View module ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view of objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various icons and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the partic@@ ul@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of showing the size of objects with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ map . every object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is proportional to its size . this size does have to possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ or@@ derly objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object is .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a folder reflects the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is specified . in this way , large files can be recognized even if they are far below in the folder hier@@ archy . thus , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered as a graphic and interactive version of the UNIX Â® command .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; it is an entry in the tre@@ em@@ ap representation of a rect@@ angle that represents a file or file in your fil@@ esystem . to easier navigation have the rec@@ tan@@ gles of meaningful color and labelling settings .
the colour of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view colour mode , may be either depth for easy detection of the connections or the illustration of another file association like name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . if enough space is used , only if enough space is used , or if enough space is used , or if the surface of sub@@ ordin@@ ates should be used ( whereby the actual position of limitations of the Tre@@ em@@ ap occur ) . in addition , you can define the relative position of labelling in rect@@ angle .
in case of production algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should usually be kept that the area is proportional to size of the entry . in case of the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always available . please note that less space is lost for frames , if the square is square .
as distribution of the area of an entry to the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation will be left . here it is necessary for marking and avo@@ idance of space losses incur@@ able by as possible , the best methods of these are lines , columns or recur@@ sive .
you can define the minimal area for entry about the menu entry level . instead , an aut@@ osom@@ al pattern is drawn in the area of the or@@ derly entry to indicate that this area is actually covered by a sub@@ ordin@@ ated entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View was originally designed &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets , which was developed for use K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .

an easy to use camera interface will be available to you with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ tised ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library G@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any medium and any card readers , supported by your operating system , will work together &amp; digi@@ tised .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; contains a fast image processing with basic imaging tools . you can use these to view your photos , comment , evaluate and correct . editing skills can be expanded easily with K@@ DE Image plug @-@ ins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ tised ; easy to use is it dozens of professional capabilities available . it works complete in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the rough conversion through li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG @-@ Export and ICC @-@ color management workflow .
improved database with much more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or lens , can be searched .
like all &amp; K@@ DE ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ tised ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . they should therefore cause problems and improvement .
&amp; digi@@ tised , trying to make problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you use the program , the help menu includes an entry problems or wishes . if you use this links , your web browser doesn &apos;t open a page in error reporting system . all required information here already registered . follow only the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ tised , is a project that is supported by a community . that means that the user and developers will help each other . if you want to join the user @-@ mailing list of &amp; digi@@ arrived . however , you would like to answer other users of other users . in this mailing list , however , you should have spoken in this mailing list .
you can also visit the digi@@ tization ; home page to visit news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ tised ; to learn .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ tised , the registration is in the developer mailing list . guidance for announ@@ cing in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ arrived ; .
if you come &amp; digi@@ tised ; for the first time , you will be asked to specify where you want to store your pictures and your database . just type or click on the folder folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you must specify a local file on your computer . here , the data is stored . this path remains the same for all image folder .
later , you can add as many folders such as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ tised , you will additionally set up as an Al@@ ben@@ library . settings digi@@ ti@@ am set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the upper folder as the basis folder . &amp; digi@@ tised , seeing each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture is changed in the folder as the folder you get a progress indicator as these :
&amp; digi@@ tised ; dur@@ al recur@@ sively the li@@ br@@ arian path in its entire depth . you can not lock any sub@@ folder . this allows you to take advantage in late folder . do you have to do a point before the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take a existing file with photos as base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List will not take photos as symbols . you can change the change by using a popular photo from the album and this will be used as an album icon . more details are available in the section albums .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My albums and my keyword to manage your photos in the albums .
raw processing support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , you can handle &amp; digi@@ tised ; possibly , the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera supports , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the help resource support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ o@@ der@@ settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy to use camera interface will be available to you with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ tised ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library G@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any medium and any card readers , supported by your operating system , will work together &amp; digi@@ tised .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera can also be realized as a USB mass storage device . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; used the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras , which has an constantly rising number of more than 800 cameras supported . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the picture transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol that has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to machines and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . as photos in general big files are and broad@@ casts on the serial port slowly , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ tised ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support has been needed to read the role models of digi@@ k@@ am reliably . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you could possibly be able to perceive images or the production could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ tised , is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ ins interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ tised ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate pictures in virtually any manner as it can also create a user . your advantage is that it &apos;s much simpler , &amp; digi@@ tised ; through writing a small module to add a function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ tised ; self @-@ perform .
in order to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 and C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
pulling and dis@@ close pictures works everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ evol@@ ve , via the horizontal separ@@ ating line or into another application window . the only limitation is not shown in brief , date list or search .
- a file selection allows you to spin the spread : JPEG , P@@ NG , T@@ IF@@ F , Ro@@ h , Movies , and audio
the text filter is only used for the fields shown in the symbol view . so the fil@@ let works on the fil@@ en@@ ame only when this ind is displayed symbol view . which fields shown can you configure in the dialog dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides a organized view on your photo albums . these albums can be stored in a single alb@@ um@@ b . these albums can be sorted by the folder , according to the name of their collection in the algae properties and after the date that the album was first created , sorted . the date can be changed in the attributes of the album .

the album date : if you sort your albums by date with View Albums After date .
the buttons of El@@ derly , average , latest : these put the date on the oldest , the latest image , or the passage of the album . this will first try to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last changes each file is used in this folder .
if you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ tised , the first image will be selected as symbol for &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; selected . this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you will need to click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; as Alb@@ um@@ preview @-@ quot ; select . additionally you can draw the photo on the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be cancelled .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; supports the entry of keyword for individual photos in the field of My details list below in the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection include all the photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you the main view of your photos available . if you select an album , all pictures will display in this album in the image window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two pins of the tool bar .
when you open an album the first time you have to wait for short , while the preview can be generated . this allows you to re @-@ use Ex@@ plan@@ ation in the Tools menu .

you should consider that it may come after processing different educational programs to problems with the image containing met@@ ad@@ ata . some programs store this data not with , if you store the modified image . this is how you lose information from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , flower@@ ing etc .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; two options are available for rotation . the sim@@ pl@@ est is to view and select the mouse button . in the lower menu , you can specify the level of rotation .
to change the file name of a photos , you can click on the preview and select F2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .

photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos and cat@@ alog@@ ing . tags are sti@@ ckers that were assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword is assigned , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again .
if a keyword is selected , all photos will be marked with this keyword .
tags can be sorted in a hier@@ arch@@ ical tree . you can also log@@ ically organize your keywords . you can also use parts of the tree &amp; quot ;
the tags will be stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , stored . you can also use your tags in other programs . furthermore , the tags in the loss of the database is imported ; once &amp; digi@@ tised ; the images noticed .
you can add new notes by clicking on &amp; quot ;
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and delete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not delete . just the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by pushing it to the desired position in tree and place there . then a menu that gives you the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once a tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ;
to select another photo as an album icon , you will need to click the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu As Alb@@ um@@ preview . in addition , you can draw the photo on the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
to use &amp; digi@@ tised ; S &amp; quot ; s functionality provided with keyword , you must first have your photos with keyword . you can put this on the right word in the tree &amp; quot ; My Key@@ word &amp; quot ; alternatively , you can click on the view of the pictures and select from the context menu .

the Advanced search provides you an extended search form with many search parameters available , with which you can find in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ tised ; s database can search .
the list of search rules is used to reset the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ Bank . any option can be added with the search ty@@ re / search group or delete each other option . any option can link with others about the logical operations all ... , One ... , no ... or Min@@ at . furthermore , you can search for the type &amp; quot ; AND N@@ eigh@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ tised , each image characterized by a long number with a special technique , hair @-@ algorithm . this allows to compare images by compar@@ ing this signature . the less@@ er the difference between two pixels , the more correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is a range in which you can drop any image . using a swelling can push the results selection or reduced . if you push a picture of somewhere above the symbol of un@@ used search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can fall there .
sk@@ etch : freedom and paint sk@@ etch : draw a fast sk@@ etch and &amp; digi@@ tised ; find the right pictures . also here a swelling can be set .
this rider provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button@@ ing around a square . put all pictures inside this coordinates are filtered and displayed . this course assumes that your photos may contain Geo @-@ data .
in the field below , you can specify a name for your Geo @-@ filters . this will then be added to a later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; provides a lumin@@ ous table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L To add the light table and open its window . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ tised ; main window , you can open the lumin@@ escent fast with L Extras .
from the front bar you can compare the pictures you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window . if you want to synchron@@ ize this copy from the tool@@ bar , select zoo , or custody operations on one of the images , then they will compare the same area of both pictures .
another mode is better suited to import fast out of the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures will be automatically displayed in the areas of the same . use the left mouse button in any window to display it in the right side . this is simplified in the right area . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar pictures .
of course , normal soldering work also works directly from the illumin@@ ant , e.g. F4 file Edit ....
all photo information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both front images in the light table . for example , it makes easy visual differences to link exposure data .
at the bottom of each section , you will find a built @-@ in p@@ anning function , which you have to detect on the crossed arrows . in order to swing the visible area of the image , you need to hold this click and the &amp; L@@ MB ; hold in mode . in the mode , both pictures are shown the same image range .
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom regul@@ ators in the image or c@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom in and out . this happens in both pictures if you are in preview ahead .
what is a digital inventory management - apart from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers any part of the process that takes up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos takes up , sc@@ anned or digital photos takes a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how you can back up your pictures , protect , protect and use photos . we consider downloading , ren@@ ame , remove , ass@@ orted , editing , optimi@@ zing , optimi@@ zing , ass@@ orted , archi@@ ved , optimi@@ zing , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , conf@@ ection@@ ate , conf@@ ection@@ ate and exports that have a mon@@ et@@ ous or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data via data . met@@ ad@@ ata is defined according to your definition , information about or manage a documentation of other data , which are managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim , if you don &apos;t know more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will not know how many photos you have . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use very fast searching and secure booking based on you with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you have to organize something in your system . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you need to decide whether other access to your photos is to be stored or on a network drive &amp; etc ; please make sure you need to switch to a larger drive at some point .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly via your location . if you are using enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images that you can print or publish at a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing the photos , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % are archives and 5 % work@@ files and you will then not want to organize your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the stac@@ king processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simplified a backup strategy and migration . you will always know whether you are looking for an original or an derived picture .
we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata to save the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ tised ; this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be written into the file . if you forgot this , then you can save the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database into the files by selecting the respective point in the menu album .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? there is &amp; digi@@ tised , they provide a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now the real work begins , because you should now select any photo words , labelling and evaluation . of course , you can select all the pictures that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos .
let &apos;s now use keyword , key words , as you are often called on other programs , or continue in categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alog@@ ised pictures from another source with built @-@ in key words , then &amp; digi@@ tised ; automatically add the tree to you . the hier@@ archy in the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by using a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed words are passed by &amp; digi@@ tised ; updated during the under@@ trees .
the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is over@@ cut . this is a very rough representation , as each block of met@@ ad@@ ata is made in truth of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are characteristics of all images .
enough of the keyword - the next section refers to prot@@ ector or comments , the third important tool for cat@@ alog@@ ing your met@@ ad@@ ata .
they don &apos;t want to see most of your photos just seeing you , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are certainly interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance it is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then catch some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this the landing field of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French mand@@ y 60 years after landing . Wow ! one begins to dream to dream associations , memories , the historical span is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the labelling has changed completely .
for others viewing your photos , the title is possibly more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you have pictures , you should tell a story . remember , the key is to help the viewer to help Him over the motive that you moves you understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength only with a lab@@ eling for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ tised , you can save a lot of text , in an internation@@ alized alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , and you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE will even export it to your wishes for your wishes and / or the title of Web @-@ gallery . you need to tell the story so for the opening of the video .
do you remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you need to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet on Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? good , because with pictures the train drives the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
the possibilities to use ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alisation are already inn@@ um@@ erable and become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys through pictures with ge@@ ographic data . however , you can also export the photos at the reception . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and refers to the practice of copyright to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also applicable in all changed versions , so also for working other .
the following description tell you what information is done in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ tised ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ onym for author and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who has created the photograph . if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s name , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographers , then it cannot be changed . this field does not support comp@@ mas nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author title ( syn@@ onym for the author &apos;s line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the job description of the photographer . examples of this can be titles as an employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the car field , this field must be filled out .
editor ( syn@@ onymous with provider ) : use the bi@@ d@@ der field to identify who works this photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a camp photo , the group / agency is offered here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not offer a little more than basic know@@ led@@ geable in the work with calcul@@ ator , this is a little more than base knowledge in the work with calcul@@ ator . for individuals , this is very important to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ tised in the near future , a module for stap@@ le processing is available .

of course we can &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or fire . this kind of losses are the same which can happen to you with traditional paper photos or negative . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which has a loss of data .
to combat the problem of CDs / DVDs , this must be treated more and more expensive than a couple of years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs about a couple of years . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe that is in your discretion .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good dis@@ cos and good recording devices . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot of reliable . so it turns the right to choose .
CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to mistakes , even if you have just written only . this is why they use a control system mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ att@@ ing and the controls . despite this massive protective cover it is needed for form@@ att@@ ing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there &apos;s a favourable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that seems to work wonders at CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and Linux ; but there are also similar applications that are not available on Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , Flash@@ media , USB drive , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to save the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything that has been said to CDs and DVDs also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disk .
burning the media with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . read the media using a description , date &amp; author license and afterwards in a clean , dark dry and before animals protected place . do not forget the data to the next generation of media before you read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
dis@@ co @-@ manufacturers keep your statistics for itself . their manufacturers are producing a new disk , but not the data . Google represents a major field study about the error mechanisms of hard drives .
in brief : dis@@ cos last the longest when you are operated in the temperature range of 35 Â° C to 45 Â° C . in case of lower temperature sensors , the most frequent error cause , SM@@ ART can termin@@ ate this error . some of SM@@ ART occur immediately . these are especially readers and publishing counter . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is just a complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a blackout if you have backed the files , but these losses usually cause no big problems .
while most electric equipment can not make a lot of power , that can take advantage of devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause severe damage on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es may cause serious damage , hardware change , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against electricity sp@@ ik@@ es is a over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is part of energy saving absor@@ bs and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug bar . remember that not any plug @-@ in bar contains a over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for a over@@ voltage protection , then you should ensure that it guarantees the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also ensure that it protects the protection against ligh@@ tening and protects the properly connected devices .
since there is an over@@ voltage of each cable to your computer , you should also make sure that all periph@@ er@@ als can be connected to your system . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms , which also contain a phone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a notebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially devel@@ opped for not@@ ebooks and therefore contain very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for travelling .
while a over@@ voltage protection your system protects against smaller variations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful in a inter@@ rup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protection from over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically shut down the battery energy when a power out@@ age occurs . some models even allow them to work until the current is running . if you buy a UPS , you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements like a over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of battery and the attached software is interesting .
don &apos;t forget the potential risk to prevent your computer system and compare its security in power problems with the cost of avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how good your computer is protected by it . finally , you should always think all cables before you go to the holiday .
the Amazon Web service is S3 - Simple Storage Service - easy storage service . with the correct configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer that you can save any amount of data .
they are compared to the hard drives at home but very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you must send the data on compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but there is no general safety solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are limited to photos . their free memory is limited to 1@@ GB . the professional version will give you more available , in the case of Flick@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 a year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked out in reality .
from the point of view of data protection , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors will be automatically cleaned up to the TCP protocol and include a backup and a shared memory . so they are des@@ aster safe .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transmission are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one says it happened when a transmission error occurred . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you have destroyed a photo and this is quite excited to have it in your computer . no one seems to have thought it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a considerably more secure data path than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission , as they generate inter@@ mitt@@ ances within the data flow . in normal fil@@ esystem these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not affected especially of transmission problems , you should see in the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems appears to be one of two candidates who can handle on low level and can be highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is also available .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . it is still in Alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that use it and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the core .
do not under@@ estimate these two factors for 86 % of data loss in notebook and 46 % on the job systems . in not@@ ebooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % .
data loss because of viruses is less common than most . it leads to a lower damage , as such as theft or re @-@ installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under Linux ; no longer yet been sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less pr@@ one for data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the most common file systems . find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the examination process at a sudden inter@@ ruption occurs during one operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are removed 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology is further developed , there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer removed from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras are used in the direction of the 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the final result are optimal for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have improved its limit for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard drive is now available for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t have any other data loss for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often subject to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , make the exchange of panels or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , ligh@@ tening strikes you if the drive was not connected to the moment .
a disaster suggests locally and destroys one quantity . forget aircraft disaster : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they normally affect an entire room or the entire house .
therefore Des@@ aster@@ ers always means not local store . bring your f@@ uses the stairs up , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files are to be secured . it is a moment , without history , and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential : a backup of files that have been changed since the last complete recovery . creates a complete moment of schedule to two points : the complete recovery and the last differential .
to create a f@@ use of files that have been changed since the last backup . this creates several moments . you can restore the original status at any time again . this f@@ use comes from a ver@@ sion@@ ing system next with the exception that it is only canc@@ eled and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool which you can easily set up on your machines . unlike the script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts copied r@@ sync only the difference of files that have been really changed . this happens and if you want to increase security via ssh .
backup important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or any other op@@ etic media .
this approach makes you enough time to discover and recover . at the same time , you come for the backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment for at least one month and a moment for every month . every further sli@@ der should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored IP@@ TC information stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC data , original storage , memory , scal@@ ability , media , restore images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visibility , ... , use of the Internet .
so valuable pictures the next 40 years survival , that is about the period in which you really interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predic@@ table due to your nature , you need to consider and re @-@ assess everything today . unfortunately , there is no other way to have a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask how the current system is backward compatible . the less varieties you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . so , if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and f@@ use technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the subject to change a system in its size . this means always enlarge .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to have placed on a dedicated plate or partition . on * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reli@@ es on a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record has been detected by the system , but do not hang it up .
&amp; dollars ; dd if = / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ I ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; dollars ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / cor@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software gives it , you can create this yourself . this task will be easier by year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format which dis@@ appears slowly from the market , so you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard . however , it can save a lot more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata for improved colour assign@@ ments to het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous platforms . the dis@@ advantage is that it has relative many administrative information , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F needs and has a slow compression . this format we would like to save your pictures .
T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as an image format . T@@ IF@@ F can store in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression season . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted from many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Negative file format is a licensed and open resource format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been based on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and is oblig@@ ated to use met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer D@@ NG is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
this is perhaps one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . file information are stored in an extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers draw it from an original image , mostly in the raw format , but it stores the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file . however , it may appear to problems with the link between the met@@ ad@@ end@@ at@@ ei and the image file , and how it is mentioned above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as container and place everything there .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards , which include a large range of application purposes and modelling , discussions and community work in D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader , or the scanner . so long the pictures are on the cam@@ er@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert blank files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a sensitive processing , you can use external programs . if you are editing the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ tised , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata . these were cut off by the other programs .
protect the mach@@ ined images of copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it only then in Web@@ gal@@ eries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ tised ; in section adding a photos to an album , you &apos;ll find a description as you can already add on your hard drive . but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your Alb@@ end@@ ata bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ arrived ; connect these with the machine , turn the camera on display mode and turn them off . another description will be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . when the connection is made , a fer@@ tig indicator will appear at the bottom and the preview of all photos on the camera will display . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file association settings are displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera .
before you download photos on your computer , you may need the camera information about every entry . with the side bars properties and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information to be saved from the camera . a symbol indicates that the image is not yet logged in to your computer . note that with some digital cameras don &apos;t have any information available .
the rider met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc. of the image . these information are the same as in met@@ ad@@ ata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tised ; or the image processing . note that this met@@ ad@@ ata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ tised , and we will try to check if the pictures were secure in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos you can download the default language methods of &amp; K@@ DE . once you select the photos , use the button to download and then select the button . the button is chosen as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , a new option is now available . these images were not yet marked by &amp; digi@@ arrived . in this case , the new pictures are downloaded with a star in front window . if you choose this option , only the new pictures are downloaded .
if you can download the buttons or download selected files , a dialogue with which you can select the target album , in which the photos will be stored . the list of existing albums can be found in section My Albums . select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you select the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ arrived ; downloads the photos of the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired image , you can delete this from the camera . you can delete all of it once by using the kno@@ b delete all . if you only want to delete some , then you will need to select this first and then delete the delete .
note that there is no possibility to restore the photos that you have deleted from the camera . so the photos are not deleted in the tr@@ lei@@ ades of &amp; K@@ DE ; you should be carefully deleted if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete the camera asp@@ ir@@ t , you should make this about the camera bag , because this is considerably faster .
cameras use as a file name for the photos often not especially meaningful name . the file names are usually deleted again after the photographs were deleted from the camera . so this can be useful , the date and time when the image was made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section , you will find options for turning and spi@@ ders of the image and file @-@ based sub@@ str@@ uts . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created per day .
the options while transfer@@ ring three additional options to be carried out before the photos are stored on the plate . the first two affect the data via the author in the default auto identity . if you select it , the relevant entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if @-@ information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you want a different file format as the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . switch the option date &amp; time . for more custom@@ ization you should read the help of the command str@@ ust .
when you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you will have the possibility to change the fil@@ en@@ ame in lower@@ case . or in case of capital letters if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ arrived ; for a photo , is displayed below the name , which displays the camera in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming files are stored and automatically used when you open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ tised , you can use all the information about the orientation of the camera for recording of recording . not all cameras make this information ready . in the section side bar met@@ ad@@ ata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , you can turn off the button . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the button Advanced and select the automatic rotation at the lower section of the window .
if your camera information is available on the date , at which the photo has been made , you can download &amp; digi@@ al . all pictures with the same date will be loaded in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras make this information available . in the section side bar Meta @-@ Data , you can read what information your camera can be embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ tised ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , use the button Advanced and select the input @-@ based sub@@ al@@ ps at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to download photos from their computer is the button to download . select upload . the file extensions dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; appears in which you can select the files that are uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ tised ; you , where the pictures are to be uploaded . select a folder dialog box for the camera . select here the desired folder and press OK to start the up@@ loading . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general concept in this document . this is a position that can be displayed in length and latitude . the identification of data can be performed from the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional photographs , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to carto@@ graphic an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environment plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you forgot later , where exactly the photo was done , you can send a browser , which can send the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tised , which can then locate the site of photos , it is good to en@@ rich the position data of a photos .
the question is how do the GPS data come to the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 has many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and card refer@@ r@@ als . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , via editing the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to ge@@ ographic mapping ( manual ) and last over the manual entry of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has a GPS unit integrated . but there are some who work with GPS recipi@@ ents together . either as card module or via transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel , since this is the only format that is the only format supported by the module to the geographical assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract the data of pictures and of the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , then you can use this script which works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs of ar@@ rests , such as map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street species . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; try to give you as much control over his work processes as possible . there are many settings that you need to access this settings . in order to set up these settings , you need to select the Settings menu . you can switch between these changes by clicking on the symbols of the left side .
please select action can view or launch image processing . you are laying down the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ tised ; firm , when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation identity and personal data . these data will be automatically selected to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is checked to download from the camera interface . it is also written on a database synchron@@ isation .

the IP@@ TC actions storing the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC rim . this means that the met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ tised ; this met@@ ad@@ ata is also available in other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ tised .
in JPEG image files ( J@@ F@@ IF ) store in JPEG image : this synchron@@ izes the comments , which you may add to your photos , with the images embedded in pictures . attention : in pictures that already contain lab@@ eling , these are over@@ written by &amp; digi@@ tised ; over@@ written .
the page settings contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse pointing to the main window of a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ tised ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to determine which file types &amp; digi@@ arrived ; advertisement , you can add the file extension of this list and remove . Alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner , which has no one of these extensions , will be from &amp; digi@@ tised ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by clicking the button up@@ dating right from each category .
the settings of the digi@@ tis@@ mal &amp; digi@@ tis@@ mal font can be set on this page . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . however , the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size lad@@ ders ; if you have one , then you can get a better check results .
by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer another color , you can select it here . you can switch the tool bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brigh@@ ter colour in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing , this anom@@ ali@@ mode can be switched off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
using Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling is meant that the images should be coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the colors . please read this article in Wikipedia for the next explanation .
using P@@ NG files , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not decrease the image quality , since P@@ NG needs a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a quick calcul@@ ator , you can put this value on a high compression . thereby 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
in combination with the T@@ IF@@ F files , you can turn the def@@ ending -@@ Com@@ pres@@ sion@@ sal@@ g@@ m for T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it has no influence on image quality , because the de@@ ceased -@@ algorithm uses los@@ s@@ less .
with the setting los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can save los@@ s@@ less loss . even if you write the loss of loss , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in the normal JPEG . as this paragraph was written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not supported yet , but was in planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ tised , the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialogue you can change the settings of image processing .
the standard im@@ itation is that all green pixels are equal . if you use this option , this difference is a bit pattern in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option records the image a bit soft , elim@@ in@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 bra@@ id pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
when this option is set , the bald is used immediately . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the bald is not set . standard is a fixed color balance , based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD &apos;s SLR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that the images contained in four steps more details in the sh@@ ines . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the sh@@ ud@@ der , i.e. the parts of your images that are burned @-@ in , because of the in@@ ability of your camera shows the pointed white in the settings . the setting is created a few unusual results because they are able to recon@@ struct the sh@@ re@@ els in various ros@@ at@@ Ã¶@@ nen . last@@ ly , you can try to recon@@ struct some parts of the missing information from the peak beam .
this is possible because blue pixels generally doesn &apos;t satisfy as fast as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to recon@@ struct the missing green and red parts from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question how many color or white you want .
if you select the option you get the option you get a level . here &apos;s a value of three compromise and / can therefore be adapted for each image individually .
put the lumin@@ ance to your taste . you probably need to set him somewhat higher than the standard 1 . but this can also be done later in the image options of &amp; digi@@ tised ; in order to keep the time for the demo@@ lition , you should be conservative .
an demo@@ lition algorithm is a digital imaging process to calculate a complete picture of the particles , which have many cameras and that is a Matrix colored pixel . this algorithm is also known as CFA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color structure .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like this . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was produced by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it produces color tips on the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable outcome .
if you know the colour devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue pro@@ o@@ fre@@ ading values here . this is certainly the best method for a color soft@@ ness , as you have performed during the ec@@ ode .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions like this to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ arrived ; information such as the color information from a colour space to the other are as precisely as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions , if a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with rough files .
color Profile Fol@@ der insert up here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you all save your profiles . &amp; digi@@ tised ; this folder will examine then during the start .
settings of the ICC Pro@@ files you have the ability &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can be changing to opening the raw file later .
the colour administration view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your pictures are not managed by the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model . not all profiles are created on the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain color mapping or G@@ amm@@ ak@@ or@@ phr@@ ases . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma is not corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means you must perform the mapping yourself .
there are more options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how to print your image from one device . this is very useful before you can print a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore may be saturated rather than leaving your printer on the blind algorithm .
for most cameras it &apos;s pretty obvious that color profile for them is planned for them . unfortunately not on the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ officially :
the Canon pro@@ filing extension makes the style for the purpose : F for an exact style , L for Land@@ scapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; image plug@@ in interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; K@@ DE ; image viewing and image processing is supported . many modules support , which were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules , and these modules will then be downloaded from &amp; digi@@ tised ; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you can also see some of them in the context menu .
short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules , can be placed in menu under Settings menu .
for more information ( in English ) over K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ in .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the di@@ sten@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regulator is adjusted the time between the cap@@ tions , usually a 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other check boxes turn the met@@ ad@@ ata and off , which are displayed at the lower end of the pictures during the display .
the camera characteristics are shown on the left side a list of all the time supported cameras . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , which is trying to identify the camera . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in image mode . currently , here are serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have chosen a UPS or Fire@@ Wire mass storage racks . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / then , indicate your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tised , you need to connect the camera to your computer , and turn them into the display mode .
try out whether &amp; digi@@ tised ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es you . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . once you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this will display cameras from the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all here .
with the confirmation dialog for re@@ loc@@ ating &gt; images in the tr@@ ash dial , you can adjust the conversation of &amp; digi@@ tised ; in the del@@ eting of a photos in an album , you &apos;ll find further details in the cut @-@ up of a photos and del@@ e@@ tion of an album .
the editorial changes due to the right side bar can be shut down by &amp; digi@@ tised ; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without asking you . otherwise , you need to apply the changes with the button changes .
you can also take the welcome of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ tised ; at the start , it acceler@@ ates the starting point of &amp; digi@@ tised ; .
the setting B@@ m start looking for new photos for@@ cing &amp; digi@@ tised ; the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ tised , asking &amp; digi@@ p@@ added ; you , whether it should er@@ ase this from the database .
various color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ tised , to adjust the main window to your taste . this settings can be chosen under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be listed below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in making a new design for &amp; digi@@ tised , you will find more information about this tut@@ orial .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use this to view your photos and improve your photos and improve the image processing on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the updated ads / Edit .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tised ; so they are not part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , please refer to the image processing section .
a status bar at the bottom edge of the window , the file name , current fil@@ en@@ ame , magni@@ fying factor , and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge and among them the tool@@ bars for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
editing functions of image processing change your photos . not the features will change the original photo before you use file Save or the button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo once you saved the image .
so you should then make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save with file save as possible .
as long as you have not stored the photo , you can restart the original image by repe@@ ating the editing file or the button The button restore image processing res@@ ellers in the tool bar . you lose any change which you have done at the photo since last Save .
virtually every action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting transi@@ tional or re@@ produced by editing the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make use of the key@@ note , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z for revers@@ ing and run C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
if you want to press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are either revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation button in the tool@@ bar , picture above or the entries in the menu file . if you have done changes in the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can get in the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the tool@@ bar menu .
to attach a photo to the window size , you can automatically select this button in tool bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full @-@ Mode shows the picture in full screen mode . you will also see the tool@@ bar . if you do not want this to change the tool@@ bar . if you do not want this , you can call this in the installation dialog by &amp; digi@@ tised ; you can call this from the &amp; digi@@ tised window . see the section for editing the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print in the image file image and get the default &amp; K@@ DE ; print dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print individual pictures or whole sentences . all picture pages can be printed out of your selection . you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album exp@@ orting printing assist@@ ent . if you follow the assistant , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; main window has a side bar on the right edge , which displays important information and promotions for selected pictures . the same side bar is available without the navigation parts , even in the image processing . it will be displayed if one of the five riders are cli@@ cked :
multiple cli@@ cks on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear and disappear again in the edge .
in the PA view , you can insert notes with unlimited size or insert . note : the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . that means all the special characters are allowed to use EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - Fields that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and use special characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should note these restrictions .
after you comments , you either use the button on users or change the next image , the prot@@ ector are then saved .
besides the user button , there is a button More . with this , you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . but you can also write the met@@ ad@@ ata to the files . this is always done if you have a met@@ ad@@ ata default always written into the pictures .
the section rating is an assessment scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sor@@ cer@@ ations . it can be used either by a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the side@@ bar or with the keyboard cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . the evaluation from the side@@ bar will always be applied to one image . in order to evaluate more pictures at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written into the IP@@ TC field . the encoding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keyword , the keyword tree and a box with the previously used in this &amp; digi@@ tised ; - session on rec@@ ited keyword .
the keyword is adapted dynam@@ ically to the adjusted search phrase . you can quickly accum@@ ulate the number of possibilities in search of a keyword fast . this ability is especially useful if you have a lot of keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering the keyword in a picture series . if you have entered different words , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by mark@@ ers of the respective check boxes in a tree . all tags of a picture are stored in the IP@@ TC field Key@@ word .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter .
the side@@ bar sample filter is used to change the selection of the main window displayed . normally , the left side bar will be used with their album , date , sample and search views . if in addition , one or more keyword filter is used in the right side , only the cutting volume of these two is displayed . all words are available .
you can also drag and disman@@ tled . if the keyword already exists , you can easily go from the right side bar and put on the selection . then a dialog box you will ask if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a cal@@ ender date . the keyword filter is reduced to no keyword , which was reduced to three images . they were drawn with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and afterwards , a keyword from the right hand @-@ tree is drawn up and placed there . a dialog asks if this keyword is supposed to be set .
these search for changes will take place at any start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings .
if you have a rule with and created and discover that it should be one or be , you can easily change it with a double @-@ click on the text and control .
( 1 ) : the entry that is searched for in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that has already been placed in the database .
for example , you can define an extended search on all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options look as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flick@@ r not listed ? the free storage place is limited to 1 GB , and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / Tut@@ orial was written primarily by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mostly adapted to &amp; digi@@ tised ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color@@ less workflow . you can get a predic@@ table devi@@ ation from your camera or scanners . you can print out the colors on your monitor via your camera or scanner and that you print or in the web , which correspond to them from your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme comes to color management , then everyone wants to press the buttons that he wants to push for the results . unfortunately , the sense of this tut@@ orials will allow you to provide sufficient background information about color management . in addition , links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions to make you the desired result .
if your photo work@@ flows fulfilled every six below , then you must not take care of the file management .
you are working on a monitor that is cali@@ br@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see further information below )
their only other images are via e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB does so well , and life for everyone is so easy , why should you use another color space and have to make thoughts about color spo@@ ils ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colours that we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colours that can see , the hu@@ fe@@ ather @-@ shaped region , and the colours in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger colour brow@@ s , so visit Bruce Lind@@ ner &apos;s excellent site and then click on Info and then on Information About RGB Working spaces .
do I have to cali@@ br@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you &apos;re working on the s@@ RGB @-@ color space or not , you need to monitor your monitor on s@@ RGB . if you are working as a color space of s@@ RGB , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual processing .
the functionality norm@@ alize , balance , automatic and contrast expand from the menu , automatic correction will automatically try to make the best of your colors . they will be experiment@@ ing with these effects , to see which works best at your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aling leuk@@ emia values above the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible will change without its color sha@@ ded . this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed .
in the same way : this method is adjusted the illumin@@ ating element of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of intensity of the image is as flat as possible . sometimes , the compar@@ ing very good results in improving the contrast of a picture , sometimes it produces only garbage . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles with a painting or destroyed it .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . they determines the dark and light border tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels onto the entire hist@@ ogram area .
contrast Exp@@ and : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ ance of the RGB values of a picture by post@@ p@@ one of the lowest and highest values in between the highest possible range and a new ji@@ us@@ ement of all values in between . this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the bald head of &amp; digi@@ tised , is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the bald @-@ like photographs .
the white @-@ like correction is slightly restricted because of a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can do so far from the original picture , areas with over@@ size can occur in the 16 @-@ bit mode , allowing you to improve your possibilities to correc@@ ting better .
this tool is based on a white balance sheet by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ y@@ m protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ y@@ m . you start it via the menu entry colors white lev@@ elling the image processing .
the front window can be adapted inside the size . on the left hand , both the original image as well as the preview of the goal look . the preview will be dynamic as well as the preview of the tool . if you want to see the original whi@@ tish immediately , it &apos;s enough to click on the window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ ers . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this mar@@ ker is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the right above , a hist@@ ogram is shown that dynamic changes will change when you have a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixel can choose very small lumin@@ ance levels . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your total is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your score depends on shade , satur@@ ation and gamma . shadow Adju@@ st@@ ment lets you improve the sha@@ ding details of your photos or also di@@ mming down .
with the above @-@ mentioned checks , you should use the colour temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and afterwards somewhere on the picture preview to use the color of the color temperature of the white balance . this type will also set the temperature and green values automatically .
in addition , you can set the bald immediately with the list of pre@@ ferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ size indicator increases the colors , when more than a colour channel of pixels is over@@ exposed . this will display the combined result in the white balance . this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as and store are exactly this . every attitude of the white balance you have set to store with a text file and load later .
the button pre@@ ferences reset all the fil@@ tration values back to their default values and the matching white balance . note that also neutral settings a different photo than your original will be submitted . if you store this , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the code depth per colour channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is better for high quality images . however , this encoding requires more record space , calcul@@ us and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog like the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour mapping can be performed by the under@@ window for the hel@@ lig@@ ations . detailed instructions for use of color profiles can draw the chapter color management .
another important tool is available in the menu below colors tone correction . this tool provides a built @-@ in way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner can always make the same mistakes and you can always find the same correc@@ ting . in the manual for tape correction , you will find further information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colours Gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; tool colour aspects provide you four colour defects , a solar system effect , a bicycle effect and an edge filter .
in times of the chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect that was developed if one was partially developed under pressure a short flash light and afterwards the effect of the image was inver@@ ted . this tool was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar isation . at approx . 50 % intensity the picture shows which chemical is possible . another increase is finally a negative image that is not to be installed on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar panel . the original image is ( 1 ) and the processes ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is about 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter is sim@@ ulated the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; Effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation that it makes a more powerful contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . simply try to emb@@ ell@@ ish many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an optimized colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contra@@ sts . however , the characteristics make it a few phot@@ ograph@@ s , especially those who have little landscapes , too much .
the ne@@ on@@ filter is sim@@ ulated on the contra@@ sts . parameter Level controls the brightness of result and the shift repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ ance of your photos with the tools in the menu . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you are applied .
if you can make a photo in bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to view it . all changes you can do in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tools Gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ph@@ starch / contrast / Gamma is the tool of clay @-@ correction to improve exposure . even if the dialogue is very complicated , you need only the range of sli@@ der . specifically the three sli@@ ps below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or of the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ps into the inside are cli@@ cked and the post@@ pon@@ ed can change to change the intensity of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the regulator , and make sure how the picture changes .
on the right hand , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . preview can be updated dynam@@ ically , using the settings of the image , updated on the left side are the following options available .
sc@@ aling : this selection box can be displayed if the hist@@ ogram is shown using a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis . in pictures the large areas of a constant colour is often dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the logical hist@@ ogram of a single pillar is dominated . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic division is useful .
three kno@@ bs : the top for dark tones , the middle for the bright sounds and the bottom for the middle sounds , often called Gam@@ ma@@ h .
the three color pin@@ ball can be used in the preview of the original image , to adjust the input values of shadows , medium and bright sounds automatically . moreover , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each range . there are also two controls which can be used , for example , the output values can be used , for example , to create a booked image as background , while something else in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : this button will automatically be set automatically depending on the intensity of the image .
store as and loading : using these buttons the set values in the file system can be saved and later re@@ charged . to do this , Gimp is used .
if you use this mode and select three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shadows , resources and sun sets . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette to set you up and click on the preview of the original image for Red , Green , Blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ can@@ als .
the option re@@ supply indicator provides all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels , and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below , you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha Channel , and the output values are unchanged . the original picture is with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the original and the target image is shown . a preview of your settings will be updated dynam@@ ically . on the right hand side options are available :
Modification channel : this selective box allows to specify the channel which is altered by the module :
besides this switch , two symbols are located to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . mostly linear mode has been used . in this case , linear mode produces a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode provides a wide beam .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds may be dar@@ ker , corresponding to the image of the pixels .
on the preview of the original photos is a red markings to see . if you move this mar@@ ker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve , which is the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
store as and store : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every bend you can created can be saved with this file system and later , the file format is the Gimp Cur@@ r@@ format .
if you create this method and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes -@@ buttons automatically create the controls of the curve for all channels of the shadow , Central and Sonn@@ ent@@ Ã¶@@ ne . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette to set you up and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curves .
the option re@@ viewing angle indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixel . if in more than a channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that has been corrected at the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and Sundays was applied to the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the correct ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer in &amp; digi@@ tised ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels , or change the colour sha@@ ding of the photos .
the channel mixer is another high @-@ developed tool to mix color shades of images . you can edit it from the menu images channel bl@@ ender of image processing .
selecting the channel selection box you can select the colour for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left area of the window is shown to you a preview . the original can be viewed as a comparison to your own riders .
the preview of the target picture has a red mark@@ ers . if you position this in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to display the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : regulator for red , green and build it will allow you to change these channels only if you are also able to activate the corresponding video components . this is especially convenient if you can also reduce the option mon@@ ochro@@ me when the channel mixer is to generate your photos . try to reduce the green immersion for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color appears to a visible smoke that doesn &apos;t appear on the same place in the color canal and it looks different in any channel . if that is the case you can improve your Mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion , which allows you to reduce the colour@@ ing first .
the stores as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any audio setting allows you to save and then download . the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format .
the option re@@ supply indicator provides all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels , and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below , you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re @-@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white @-@ photography was always fascinating about your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a working step , because paint images can simply be converted to the machine . also with a set of film roll@@ ers .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filters . this looks good , with all scenarios and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
orange @-@ filtered : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens . this improves landscapes , marine , and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Oran@@ te .
red Filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filters . this creates dramatic sky effects and can sim@@ ulate Moon@@ li@@ ans at the time of day . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ Filter .
yellow filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow linear filter . this is the natural color of color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm light and medium sounds while it adds a bit of cold into the shadow @-@ tones . this is very similar to the process of le@@ aking a pressure and re @-@ development in a sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ tised ; tool texture can use decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , an pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a wall painting on a wall . the menu entry image and image processing can be used for this .
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter after the right increases the impression of the depth and the three @-@ dimensional texture on the image .
a paper texture effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed ( 2 ) . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
powered by &amp; digi@@ tised ; tool frame can be added to a decorative frame around one image .
to keep the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photos is not easy task . a possibility to keep its attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the scatter@@ ing eye . under picture frame , the module can be started from image processing .
type : with this parameter , you adjust the desired size of frame for your image . pier@@ cing the image with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white pictures ) , cut it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a bu@@ ck effect and decor@@ atively adds a decorative frame with pattern .
width : width of frame rate in percent . the value for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
this goal is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the pictures , especially if you use the tool after aspect ratio .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple a large @-@ format text to any location in any location . this also goes to several places when you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use tex@@ tual direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its qualities as you need . the bigger the image , the larger the character set . finally , select an frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
every attitude that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you hit the button &quot; OK &quot; after the image is saved once , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed .
using the &amp; digi@@ tised ; tool template can apply a template via a picture .
the menu image template can be used in image processing can be used to create templates .
for the template , there are no restrictions on the size and the orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should also add to the file size of the template . if you want to add your template into the template ; please send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ arrived ; Mail@@ ing list digi@@ arrived @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
when you use this tool for the first time you will need to select your sten@@ cil template with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder you can copy the template . you &apos;ll notice these settings for the next start .
after the root folder was set for sten@@ cils , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template &apos;s folder . the selection of a folder will be updated automatically .
below the preview three buttons are available with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button increases the displayed image . it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ ink : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole image , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to post@@ p@@ one the image below the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
please use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adapted automatically .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; sets three different tool for sharp@@ ening . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharp@@ ened is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very quick and simple , but produces particularly in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
un@@ sharp@@ ened mask works on the contrast of the edges to look up a picture . actually , it is not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ es and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and he is copyright protected by Winston Chang .
Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ ze is probably the best of the three because he really improves the sharp@@ ness . it &apos;s a little complicated in its application and has various parameters to adapt .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alised pictures need a correction of sharp@@ ness . these elements are smaller than the resolution , so that sharp edges can be printed together with only minimal differences . the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras require more retro@@ active sharp@@ ening than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG image , a camera has been widely applied to internal sharp@@ ness . images in the base format , however , must always be sharp@@ ened during processing .
some scanners are sending a sharp@@ ening device during the image of the image . if you dis@@ able this de@@ activ@@ ating , you get control of your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by sharp@@ ening a photo with the sharp@@ ening device node . this allows you to correct the menu entry .
they should her@@ eby be careful , because the results are not very natural : sharp@@ ening raises the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the useful technique increases the tool ref@@ us@@ .@@ It will achieve further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ening .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution that image a little soft to draw is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool for a soft mark using the menu entry . this window display shows you the effect on your photo .
the Filter is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils of your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and preview can help you edit the picture . the window display shows the output of the movie with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values produce good results and should first be tried . an increase of radius or amount increases the effect . if you make the un@@ shar@@ k mask to be strong , noise and impression of gr@@ ats close to sharp edges .
the radius is like a lot of pixels on each side of a channel by the filter . high resolution images allow larger radi@@ als . they should therefore shar@@ pen pictures at best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage of the original and the know@@ led@@ geable image is added to the original . thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the swelling is a rup@@ ture of the maximum RGB @-@ value and the difference . you can thus define a minimum difference in this way for a c@@ annon of filters . in this way , areas with a soft change between killing of shar@@ per and therefore f@@ law is avoided in faces , heavens and water surface areas .
this is an example of the un@@ re@@ peti@@ tive filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . in@@ sharp m@@ asked with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a corpor@@ al value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; tool re@@ oc@@ us@@ ability re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to prevent a painting on &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing quot ; in which the traditional technique is used as only to try the photo . Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ ades is usually achieved better results than in@@ sharp m@@ asked . you can launch it from the menu by arous@@ ing colors ref@@ using .
in practice , the circular folding is much better than the Gau@@ Ã &apos;s F@@ ind . the Gau@@ Ã &apos;s F@@ unding has a very long tail , which also leads to the mathematical result from the source pixel . the F@@ IR Vienna In@@ verse is influenced by the original pixel . the F@@ IR Vienna In@@ verse is influenced by far away pixels . that causes undes@@ i@@ rable results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular division . it is the most important parameter for use of this module . for most images , the default value should set 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very un@@ sharp , but should pay attention to Heiligen@@ vou@@ chers .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ening effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter may help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , and eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a useful value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value is added to the image even further .
Gau@@ Ã &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ Ã &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your un@@ sharp@@ ness of G@@ auss is caused . in most cases , use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you need a value zero , you may need to increase the correlation and / o@@ der@@ den .
match size : this value determines the size of transformation matrix . an increase in the size matrix can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ Ã &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the stores as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any ref@@ usal parameter values are set to be stored for later and then can be loaded .
try all the cutting , color and intensity correction on the image before you use the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that many surg@@ eries are not immediately visible , but left un@@ comfortable arti@@ facts .
if you read pictures and com@@ press , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed picture .
generally , un@@ sharp mask produces better results than sharp@@ ening . this could be caused by this , which uses in@@ sharp m@@ asked a larger neighborhood as sharp@@ ening .
theore@@ tically it must produce in@@ sharp mask . even under optimum conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharp@@ ness . for the Wiener filters it can never be the effect of the optimal linear filters . practical is the result of the F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ ters always at least as good as the in@@ ox mask . the F@@ IR Vienna filter is often better when editing small details .
below , you can see a comparison between different fil@@ let , on a small un@@ focused picture , see :
the original un@@ clear colour picture has to be corrected . this picture has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to in@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information about the methods for sharp@@ ening error in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the kno@@ b is the sharp@@ ened of the range of dark@@ ened , to create a more natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the colour tin@@ te allows a adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can adjust this here .
the tool error correction is one of the most advanced tool to remove non @-@ use arti@@ facts with an unprecedented speed .
the in@@ ventive algorithm has been developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as strong points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab smoo@@ thing , and advanced settings .
detailed gaining p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to a smooth glass of the image . a smaller value leads to a smooth glass place over the image . a value of 0.9 should keep details so that no sharp@@ ening is necessary . please note that the detailed accounting should always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
breakdown depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value sm@@ ooth@@ es evenly across all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you produce a film grain or CCD noise , we produce a high @-@ wave pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts will be best out at a value in the vicinity of 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this makes the maximum smoo@@ thing factor of all@@ ot@@ p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore set this value as suitable for the degree of space in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is concerned more structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ ther , because it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be higher than 3 .
re@@ petitions : there is often an algorithm to pass through . usually here is 1 or 2 out of the algorithm .
angular step@@ ping width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle depend@@ ant integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is small , there should also be small . be sure to create small angles for a long time . so , you should choose this value as much as possible and un@@ acceptable to your needs .
integral step range &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step @-@ wide in pixels . you should avoid the value smaller than 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation Use : the More an quality that you receive through choice of this option is only low . he doubles the duration . we recommend it therefore .
the buttons save as and loading are exactly this . any setup of image errors can be saved in a text file and then re@@ loaded again later .
frame errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , however , it can last a long time and move a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b kno@@ b .
below , you can see as picture errors fixed with small arti@@ facts . the module is used on a photo that has been made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see , there is a unique black arti@@ fact that caused by a bad film storage during the trip . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tised , smoking production is a very powerful tool to decrease sculp@@ ting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides a selectable image filter to remove spots and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ vocation ; -@@ effects of ein@@ clu@@ ded images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensors of digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tut@@ orial .
the screenshot picture above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny , which can be removed with this tool .
in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the under@@ window advanced settings can remain in default settings .
radius controls the window size , of 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter per pixel is needed , and the color in it is ge@@ ared towards the image and the color in it is sm@@ ooth@@ ed and thus slightly smaller flaws .
sharp@@ ness : controls the depth distance . this value sets the pixel distance from the filter to front . if it is increased , noise tips will be deleted if you need to change this setting . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer receive and rob@@ ber@@ y or lubric@@ ate .
edges : controls the accuracy of the edge for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response . if it is too strong cannot be removed or rob@@ ber@@ tips may occur . put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak space or JPEG arti@@ facts .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend you change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process of the details pane .
color : controls the colour toler@@ ance of the image . we recommend you change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process of the details pane .
gamma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically stronger , however , it toler@@ ates the shadow areas .
d@@ amping : controls the alignment of the ph@@ yl@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius re@@ acts on the lumin@@ ance of lumin@@ ance . if it is increased to a minimum , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter may appear at the edges . it can remove space tips and is the recommended method for this .
store under and store : these buttons are used precisely for this . all parameters are stored for smoking production , which you have to be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how smoking production can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and corrected ( 2 ) . the noise was applied to standard settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution that image a little soft to draw is much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool for a soft mark using the menu entry . the window display shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ arrived ; Photo rest@@ oring is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo@@ art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for rest@@ oring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undes@@ i@@ red arti@@ facts about your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove G@@ auss &apos;s , film grain , scrat@@ ches , com@@ pres@@ sive images and local errors that takes place along the frame and maintains the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and tex@@ tures . the texture is carried out with another tool , the image errors that was developed . algorithm for restoration was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ um and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss of los@@ ers , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are in un@@ compressed picture . this attitude shall correct these problems .
the buttons save as and store are exactly this . every attitude of photo rest@@ oring can be saved in a text file and later re@@ loaded again .
photo rest@@ oring is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it may take a long time and move a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button closure .
below , you can reduce like a photo with tie @-@ shaped smoke . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) 700@@ Si camera to a Il@@ ford ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and corrected under ( 2 ) .
below , you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures can be found on an old color photo that has been read with a scanner . you can see the scan @-@ arti@@ facts that have been viewed from sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ arrived ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove Hot@@ pixel of photos that were taken with a CCD camera , eight were used . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
light , dead or hot pixels are particularly high quality raw materials , as many cameras have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression with JPEG compression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark picture sub@@ trac@@ ting method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the wi@@ zard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to explore the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD &apos;s defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the right dark picture to the correct image . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel . note that the assistant remembers the last dark picture and re@@ charges this automatically in the next session .
the image range and the preview can help you correct the result inside the image . the projection window shows the output of the fil@@ ters with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all pre @-@ looking areas .
select an area around the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the movie . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing this pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ cut : an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined . it is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels have a distance of 1 from the pixel block to inter@@ pol@@ ate the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixels block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn , to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel .
below you can see the hot pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; Vig@@ net@@ tic @-@ correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ation , i.e. underground corners to correct a picture .
wide angle lens , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often lit up the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ t@@ quot ; ( sha@@ ded ) they can reach the corners and edges of the image , by reducing the light to the sensor there . Tel@@ e@@ Ob@@ jective show this behavior .
but it also has draw@@ backs . many center @-@ filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the Bl@@ en@@ den@@ Filter , which should be impossible to keep the camera with hand . wide angle lens should use , also with center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , otherwise un@@ sharp@@ ening effects caused by motion .
it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of an Cent@@ er@@ filter by current filters and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of an Cent@@ er@@ filter by em@@ ulated a equivalent of a Cent@@ er@@ filter . the tool is protected by a Cent@@ er@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is copy@@ righ@@ ted by John Walker .
with three shelves , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ tic @-@ correction filter , and with three more exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light strength absorption at the point of the greatest density the fil@@ ters . the standard density is 2.0 , which allows an optical filter with an aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or randomly to compens@@ ate the density to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of Vig@@ net@@ ation , you reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
Leu@@ ph@@ starch , Con@@ trast and Gamma -@@ Settings : the Edit of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ tic @-@ correction reduces the exposure of the target image with these options . the regulator represent you only positive values , as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want to adjust the exposure of exposure of the target image , so let the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / Gamma in zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ arrived ; image processing from the menu color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ tic correction c@@ ture to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the correct image in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; lens di@@ stortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses in photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric di@@ stortion . colour di@@ stortion can not be corrected with this tool .
the second order is treated with the general geomet@@ rical di@@ stortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but laughs at the edges . these correction is not used in the tool .
the coefficient of the coefficient corrected the remote ver@@ tic@@ es to the second @-@ degree . if you combine these two can be eliminated almost any geomet@@ rical di@@ stortion .
in general : this value controls the thickness of the di@@ stortion of the second order . with negative values , tons @-@ shaped di@@ stortion can be corrected and positive values ho@@ ver@@ tically di@@ stortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the di@@ stortion of the fourth degree . this value seems stronger in the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; corners &apos; parameters are the inver@@ ted sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value is sc@@ aled down the image size , thereby enabling a correction of first grade . negative values can increase while positive the image .
brigh@@ ten : this value adjust brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values improve it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview the di@@ stortion correction . the values you use for your image will be stored and used as default values at the next start .
the tons or cus@@ hion correction should be carried out prior to all inf@@ low or size changes . best result you execute these correction as all first . if you have a picture of new and then a ton @-@ shaped correction would be the effect of the Fal@@ se .
to help you find the best correction to you , this tool provides a vertical and horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place . in the connection you can correct the k / cus@@ hion di@@ stortion with the help of the lines .
if you have a cus@@ hion di@@ stortion , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can trans@@ ize this with the cutting tool in the menu , cut out of image processing or about the zoom in this dialog .
for most pictures the ton@@ ne @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as recordings from the front , frame and paintings , it &apos;s the perspective so correct to correct all the angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you keep the camera with hand , you will always have a slight di@@ stortion of perspective .
this is an example of the k @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate inf@@ ra @-@ red film from the G@@ import gur@@ u.@@ org website which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( TM ) S@@ FX@@ 200 infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the range for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can look at the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview , you can sim@@ ulate two parameters of film liqu@@ or and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controls changes the amount of film liqu@@ or and domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filters color channels are mixed to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the colors are missing .
this is an example of the infrared profile definition applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined picture under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the sh@@ ank .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; Fil@@ etry is an easy to use tool to re@@ produce film liqu@@ eurs on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to enhance the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers of great silver chairs in the photo@@ emul@@ sion .
the film management efficiency gives your photo a certain atmosphere , or seems to move back into the past . if you want to get rid of this special , gallery @-@ like , road photographic , gra@@ ined sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , so you need to use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be cali@@ br@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , if you need more grains , so you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film effect on a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that used the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; filter oil paintings produces the appearance of an oil painting . it is used by a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; Filter Oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance , like an oil painting . nature pictures and styles are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the top cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thick brush is better suited for large images . fl@@ atten the glasses or , from the other side view , the char@@ s .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and that worked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel wide picture is 1 and Gl@@ orious 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; filters carbon drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to define a coal plant . therefore , pictures of their gra@@ dients are slowly changing for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch you . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top regulator does the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast ( gl@@ os@@ cope ) .
this is an example of the carbon drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result may be further improved by adju@@ sting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; filter engraving is your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; filter engraving is a quick tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the picture into a gray , mon@@ umental landscape .
depth allows contrast to the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by de@@ compos@@ ing effects . it is used by copyright protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : share the image in cells and look it as if it is viewed by gl@@ ass@@ blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the waves 1 , the image will be dist@@ orted here with another version of glass pieces .
some effects require long time for calcul@@ ating and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with the button closure .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using un@@ sharp@@ ened effects . it is used to copyright protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom U@@ tili@@ ze : get the image along st@@ ern@@ able lines that go out at the center . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and generates a dynamic expression of often seen in the sports photography .
radi@@ al un@@ sharp@@ ness : get the image through rotation of the pixel . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ened of a turning camera .
distances : wi@@ ther the image to create a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to be back into the background .
movement of motion : wi@@ de@@ fies the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph , camera .
soft@@ ener mot@@ ions : get the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or to add a warm and subtle g@@ low .
arch@@ ers : wi@@ rel@@ ates the image through random delay of pixels and sim@@ ulates the in@@ sist@@ ence of a arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent un@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the color @-@ basins in the image and wi@@ pe them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , through the col@@ t with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require long time for calcul@@ ating and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button closure .
the drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops onto your picture . this makes it natural your pictures a wet appearance . it uses a protected algorithm used by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop size allows to change the size of dri@@ ps . since the tropical size is not automatically grown with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small pictures . number changes the number and density of drops . fish impacts change the optical effect of the drop in the image .
you can hold with the &amp; digi@@ tised ; image processing a area free of shelves . use the tool to select the area , e.g. a face that will remain free . if you then start the filter Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen the area will remain free of shelves .
this is an example of the reg@@ ind@@ rops Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the mach@@ ined picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , so you can bring it by mir@@ r@@ oring or turning into the right direction . the tools can be found in the menu , transform@@ ers , and transform@@ ers .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to create a photo by a minimal loss of image quality .
a picture to shr@@ ink is simple . the big question is , how can you find out a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information here or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm used here is a good job . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it on the desired size with the tool size . select transformation size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is visible below .
the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to shock the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ ating .
many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , such as Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ tised , uses a further developed approach . the based algorithm photo was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you have to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below :
aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the size ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is concerned more structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ ther , because it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons save as and loading will be used precisely . any insert for photo . can be saved as text file and later re@@ loaded again .
photo infl@@ ating is very quick at what it does , but it can still take a long time and move a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button closure .
you can see an example for photo infl@@ ating , by a small color image to the double size increased . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the Pre@@ view ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard penis enhancement .
the cutting of a photos is not only a common operation , but also a common under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . the mouse simply allows you to create a picture with the mouse , pressing the mouse button and tigh@@ tening the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while moving the mouse .
when you remove the mouse button , the territory of the photos will be cut off . this allows you to change a good overview of your photo following the cut . you can create the size of the cutting edge by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . you can create a new rect@@ angle using the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut @-@ up , use the button A kno@@ b button of the image processing in the tool bar and the photo will be cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file to save or file storing in the menu file to save the newly added photo .
in the fore@@ front , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by post@@ p@@ one the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you defined in the dialog remains unchanged .
in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the larger value of height and the width is assigned .
the tool for aspect ratio is used . this means that it is always equal to use regardless of whether you use cen@@ tim@@ eters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see , for example , a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue , two buttons exist for selecting the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
below , you can set the Max . relationship button to the range for cutting in the highest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool for aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are using the cutting tool the next time , these settings will be stored as default values in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the pre @-@ cut image and not the original image .
the settings of co@@ aster help allow help to bl@@ inding her images better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ious parts are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ rule , harmon@@ ic triangles a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle in a similar harmon@@ ic triangles .
golden center : the golden middle is a divi@@ ding to different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us mus@@ sel or the pet@@ als of a sunflower . it appears in all possible things that we find as beautiful .
the golden partition is the ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used to build your temples and py@@ rami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations to provide a natural order and beauty .
the number leads from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmon@@ ious .
the golden centre provides liqu@@ e@@ fied aux@@ ili@@ ary lines if you put together a picture . these assistance will be listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ als will get good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ rule the golden spiral produces a liquid line of the eye through the image . this kind of composition takes the view of the viewer along the line of spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
another rule are the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles to create the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye can be put into the centre of composition . this can just be a line or different objects . this one can just be there without the eye , it will fulfill his task .
the Golden triangles also gli@@ mp@@ se from the above @-@ mentioned golden spiral . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ious triangles , gold triangles are no equ@@ is@@ ily triangles . diagonal to walk to this lines can leave a static object more dynamic .
if you use golden triangles to break your frame , create a effect of professional photographer dynamic sy@@ mm@@ etry . try your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach differently .
the options horizontal and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ious parts .
with the button color you can set the colour of the aux@@ ili@@ ary lines . if you have a painting with many colors and a high contrast , the aux@@ ili@@ ary lines can be invisible . this type allows you to adjust the colour of your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture to any angle .
when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera not exactly ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things turned around an angle . select this with the &amp; digi@@ arrived ; image processing and tool free rotation . select transformation free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are given in degrees . with the button pre@@ ferences you can reset the sli@@ der again to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be displayed right above .
to help your help , the free rotation is a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse pointing to the two lines . after you move it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle like in previous section .
after turning a picture you &apos;ll find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to repair it is to use the function transform@@ ers from processing operations .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic cut . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing sm@@ ooth@@ es the picture a bit after the rotation . but please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ ical transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . preview can then be calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog box you will find some information which will help you change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas formed by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas that are formed by the transformation , in pixels .
corner left : shows the actual angle of the transformed territory to the upper left corner of the transformed territory .
angle right : shows the actual angle of the transformed territory to the upper right corner of the transformed territory .
angle left : shows the actual angle of the transformed territory to the lower left corner of the transformed territory .
angle right below : shows the actual angle of the transformed territory to the lower right corner of the transformed territory .
after adju@@ sting the perspective the image becomes a bit dirty . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjust@@ ments create a double @-@ strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective , you get un@@ joy@@ ful tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one possibility to transfer this , it is the picture with transformation of transformation into the image processing .
the tool tool is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is not turning the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part left . this is not turning into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can launch this module via transform@@ ers .
check your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can set horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically . when you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of Eff@@ ective will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target picture will be displayed right from the front section .
to help your help become a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool tool to adjust your image .
after completing the recovery , the image becomes a little bit wis@@ ely . this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two deposits er@@ adic@@ ated twice as much as possible and therefore you should avoid this .
after finishing the picture , the image has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . there is a possibility to eliminate this , it is the picture of transformation cutting from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; requires a number of libraries and other packages in order to read and write . the available formats are therefore compiled by your system and , in some cases , from the way like this libraries comp@@ iling from . in most distri@@ butions you will have a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ tised ;
because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on its system . however , you will always find JPEG and T@@ IF@@ F among them .
&amp; digi@@ tised , only files in formats that knows . this is done using file extension and a comparison of these with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can change this list of file extension &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ses ; accepted . in the section configuration you can find further information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras allow you to choose to use format . a more detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ tised ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression technique to digital pictures . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on an more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there is better , smooth results than JPEG on the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save los@@ s@@ less if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the resource format , you can read more about the Roh@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can also convert rough images into JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F with the raw converter of &amp; digi@@ tised ; in the section configuration you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ arrived ; .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; supports the store of Roh@@ bil@@ dern only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ tised ; her@@ eby , you can see more than 200 raw file formats . the table below shows a short list of raw materials that come from &amp; digi@@ tised ; supported :

you can choose if the graph is to be re@@ loaded , or whether you want to ignore the change , or if you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up your choice later , you can set up the menu settings ; set up ... , see also .
if you open a graph file outside an ongoing &amp; k@@ clu@@ viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph ; instance you want to open or to display the po@@ uring graph@@ s in a sub@@ window of the already current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the setup dialog .
at the program start , you can re@@ open all graph@@ s of your last session again . once again , you can save your election as well as later .
you can also define how the graph should be divided on multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you use several sites , you can select whether the parts of the graph@@ s , which should be installed on one side , will be installed on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of the graph .

to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and ps@@ man can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical Loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can result in a number of selected images using a GPS track .
select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate to the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears . to load a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization . this file contains , of course , data from the time to the same locations , as the pictures of your camera .
if the file is loaded , an automatic correlation was performed by the coordinates in red . GPS data will be recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera &apos;s time is converted with GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set up your camera zone .
setting for the maximal period devi@@ ation is a top vari@@ ance for the GPS period and camera . the devi@@ ation among them are merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have a description of a place for pictures you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all the pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have any appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can put these limits here and hit the button related to inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog can use the coordinates of a call to the next , you only need to set the button OK to put the data on the current photo .
the location can also be found with the displayed map and can be found . select the relevant region and increase si@@ e.@@ Make it over again , until you have reached an ongoing accuracy . the card can always be changed manually . the map can be changed between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here &apos;s a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums and HTML pages .
this module can export your albums up to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is en@@ coded with UTF @-@ 8 to enable a best internation@@ alization .

the tab look defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be displayed in the image . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ Show , displayed
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored in all your images . select a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export which contains everything will be created there .
in case you select the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information stored in their original images are also stored in the new pictures .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . the file size naturally influences the file size . all other settings are explained even explained .
the rider pre@@ conception allows you to watch some of the settings from the album rider for viewing images , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user to how far the action is . press down@@ fall to break the process .
when the module has generated the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program reports to indicate whether errors occur during the creation . the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the preview of the gallery . press shooting down the module .

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in form of a slide .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual pictures you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide .
all images are sc@@ aled automatically on the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can create a background color for the Di@@ asch@@ au . with this module , it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . to burn the media you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first , you need to select the images that are supposed to be packed into MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards , you can create more than Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au to create the module .
the pictures selected by you are then listed under image files . there you can also change the images or content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should choose the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you plan to select the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most probably choose the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that will specify a picture . the speed of image output is defined among them . a low value generates very sudden , a high contrast , smooth screen change .
the background colour can be set next . in doubt , you should leave them black . in doubt , you should set the name and the path of the generated file , you can define the name of the m@@ peg output file as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the film . once you can add all settings to the film , you can now drink a coffee and enjoy a coffee and enjoy the di@@ gest@@ au if you &apos;re back again .
if a hint appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages via the button settings .
the printing assistant is allowed to print multiple images on a paper @-@ printed paper . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the Gimp of Gimp . this is useful to print you or print with the Gimp module .
using this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import / convert your files stored in the RA@@ W format in one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . a original quote from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not to get the same results like the software from your camera makers . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first , select the RA@@ W file to be converted and restart the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can look at the effect of your current settings .
you can now adjust the values for the conversion process to optimize the conversion process . the main parameters such as gamma , brightness and red / blue amp@@ lif@@ iers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can process the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch does not have any effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and only the extension is adjusted , and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss of los@@ s@@ ary algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the tagged image format , T@@ IF@@ F , re@@ tains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
in case you are frequently asked to edit your images or later , you should not choose the JPEG format , as there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the met@@ ad@@ ata will be stored in the RA@@ W file in the JPEG file in Ex@@ if @-@ Information .
if you have adapted your settings you can restart the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process , you can use the break down .
the stac@@ king mode allows you to convert different images to one time . use this mode therefore if you are sure , e.g. through testing on a single image which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write the file automatically . however , this is helpful if this has been created in an earlier attempt . a preview of progress is not available as far the conversion is progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to re@@ com@@ press all pictures in an album . it uses the program in the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album should be used .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it is using the product program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image and enlarge . in addition , four types of image changes are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image will be automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 di@@ am . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to match your image format .
not proportional : non @-@ proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed in this option .
printing preparation : prepar@@ es the photo for the photo pressure . the user can adjust the pressure resolution and the size of phot@@ op@@ iers . the target picture , including background size , edge size and background colour , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the added images previously . more pictures can move to the list of tra@@ ced images and lay down there .
after having started the module , the pictures window with the selected images will be displayed . you can add more pictures on the kno@@ b . for the most viewed images , a preview can be displayed on the right page .
you can also drag pictures to the picture list and to add it to the list of leading images .
the button images will remove the selected pictures from the list of a few pictures removed .
after you select all images , you can open the new message to your e @-@ mail clients with the button OK . you just need to add the addresses and the subject . you &apos;ll have added the pictures added as An@@ nex .
do not pay attention to many pictures at once . most E @-@ Mail accounts have limitations for the size of multiple e @-@ mails . it &apos;s possibly a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the pictures . your configuration is stored and each time is used again until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify in the input field below the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail service , you have to install the G@@ Mail@@ Agent on your computer before . you can download this here .
after selecting the comments in an attached file , comments are added to the images in a text file and added the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to use the size of photo@@ files , e.g. T@@ IF@@ F . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a quick internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under Pictures file format and select the original files in JPEG format , the original exit data will be added to sen@@ ate pictures .
when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed with the search for errors , you can view . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the button shot , you can sh@@ utter this window .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions such as you want to have shown your Di@@ asch@@ au . you can choose between you selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ transi@@ tions option in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant hin@@ ts using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the file fil@@ en@@ ame indicates that the file name of the images are displayed in the left corner during the presentation .
the loop option allows you to display the presentation in an endless loop . you can immediately break it manually with Es@@ c .
the option images randomly choose to see that the images are displayed in a random order . so it &apos;s not the order of the pictures used in the album .
del@@ ays between the pictures can be set at temp@@ oral distance between the individual pictures . 1500 m@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . you should be able to show this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tional effects between which you can choose . randomly choose any transition between the pictures and another effect .
during the slide you can access a tool@@ bar on the top of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to switch you .
with this tool@@ bar you can start the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide .
at the left bottom of the screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ames , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation .

run &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialog the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry on the menu entry card . then , some sample images are loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as an associated HTML document to download .
at the bottom edge of the main square of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this surro@@ unds you can see here : . as the name suggests , this surro@@ unds will show you data statistics about the pictures in your database .
the bar can display several different time units . each loan then shows another unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see a part of a database by showing the only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be interactive on the following ways : you can select the displayed entries Pre@@ view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will display this date in preview @-@ To @-@ preview ) and also indicates the current date of the currently displayed images , if you navigate in preview @-@ view .
you can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the bar , i.e. the time data . if you select a range , you &apos;ll only display images of this period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the bar .
&amp; C@@ photo@@ albums ; provides you with two options available to create HTML pages with your pictures . the one is integrated in &amp; photo album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user book , the integrated version is described , which you can create over the HTML menu .
before HTML pages you need to use some settings . these are divided into three areas of content , layout and target . in the following , every area is accurately described .
first , enter the title of the survi@@ ving and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on the photo album ; HTML @-@ example pages you can see an example of this settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file is supposed to be seen on the over@@ sight . see information on the export files you will find in .
last , you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed . by this way , you can avoid that information on the HTML pages are obvious . for example , all pictures of a party are obvious . now , note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; currently all pictures are exported . therefore , you cannot use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain consider@@ ations .
in this area , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most of the setup possibilities are clear , so it is not specifically received .
on the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for images . this allows those to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 , no pictures download , for example , to have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer on your side can change the resolution at any time you have set up . so he can browse your pictures with low resolution , as well as if he wants to get a picture larger , he changes to higher resolution .
in this installation area , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best select for all your HTML files a base folder and for each successive sentence a new sub@@ folder .
first you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and next time . this way you can select for all future pictures to the location . here you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if these really are all visible for viewing . if you have created a web browser , after the pages have been created , the URL that you can set here should be this folder . otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not in the final destination file , you need to copy them manually . so the import function , see , properly , you need to specify the final destination of files . this is not the sub@@ folder of current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folder .
the precisely described one @-@ level setting offers all three on basic ord@@ ner or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder was created , whose name can define it in output file .
in case you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere different , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; come together , you might want to create your pictures with this share . however , if you have already picked up a lot of time to view the pictures , recep@@ tion@@ ist , etc . then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; this work is not even able to do .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; you can import a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others in your database . the image properties are made with precise and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ if the images itself are stored in the file , or if it &apos;s only a link to images , that you have all the pictures together and enter this file so independent . the obvious down@@ side is however the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the menu file Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for the images to two times . first , it is searching for images that have indicated in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the images are not found , the images are displayed if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file through the HTML export .
the following will describe dialogue for exp@@ orting images , which you can export to the Export menu ( Export ... ) .
the main option of this dialogue is whether it is supposed to take an internal or external .@@ k@@ im file , the following three selection options are available :
if Manu@@ ally , to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the pictures in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the automatic option to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; edit images , copy the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most of the images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file is very small , it usually doesn &apos;t get the files to com@@ press . if you wish to do this , simply select the export file .
the last option of this page is maximum size limit . if you send your friends pictures , you want to limit the images maybe not in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very large . here you can limit the size by , for example , that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and broad .
if you want to import a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file ... select &amp; select photo@@ albums ; the exported database as described in described .
the assistant to import consists of four steps . first you need to select which pictures you want to import , then , in which folders needs to be copied .
it can be that you can person@@ alise the category people to import file person@@ er ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is called upon your database people . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialogue window , which are to be imported in the third dialogue window , and which categories correspond to these in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compens@@ ate the categories of imp@@ acting file with the categories of your current database . an example of this you can see on the image .
it must be easy to browse images and watch images : if you look at pictures , you often want to view images of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend , you might want to see all pictures on which this friend is depicted , see .
in this manual , you will take the different steps from ( 1 ) to provide information about your images , about ( 2 ) the looking and pres@@ tige , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adap@@ tations .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program for managing your pictures . but it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often these videos also include videos .
&amp; photo album ; saves all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. , Normal safety tools , copy on a flo@@ ppy or revisions in the CV@@ S , where they want .
&amp; C@@ photo@@ albums ; remember the folder in which your images are stored and used this at future starts automatically . if you want to read another database with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
through the menu entry Settings menu , set up ... enter a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; in the following section of the user guide you will be explained to various setup possibilities .
on the left you see six different symbols , with which you can call the options of preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , an exhaus@@ tive assistance is available , which you can access the F1 button and click on the desired option .
it was described as you can create different characteristics for each image , such as persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
to view the dialog , which is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a lab@@ eling and symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete assembly groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group at once in a group rather than explained in a group instead of each group .
in seeing the installation options , which are available to you for fixed member groups . you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window of the window , you can find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; photo album ; share its module with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ ti@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this mod@@ ulation system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; image plug@@ in interface . please find information on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called upon the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; however , most modules have a help page you can call on the modules themselves .
since the modules of multiple applications can be used together , it may be that the modules used with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; you can only test new modules at first with the demo @-@ database with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . do not say , I have not warned you !
the applications that use the modules above K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible for some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; not function . this is the dis@@ advantage , if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; and other applications that are also using K@@ IP@@ I is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; this type of order is not supported , it sim@@ ulates the order for albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums .
sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current opinion , so all the images that are currently viewing the picture preview .
in addition to the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules have to be handed over to a list of albums . here goes &amp; the photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; for photo@@ albums ; S browser shows the contents of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it is the category that you &apos;ve specified in the installation dialog as category for virtual albums , for example , if you are using the Category people , it will be &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so , if you have selected persons on the view and to pass the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; not compatible , you can remove these from the list of modules . just start the installation dialog , and select the module modules , which are to be loaded modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen when you run &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window with which you can browse your photo database . at the moment , it does not contain a lot of information about your pictures . in the section we &apos;ll show you some information about your pictures , but now click on the record images that shows you an overview of all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; is the opportunity to see any image with notes on the picture , where the image was recorded , etc . you can put any image either individually or for a larger number of images , at the same time . if you are depicted on all images of Jes@@ per and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen .
all these notes may be used for searching and brow@@ ses , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes , if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
in watch three lists with a text box by setting up people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; because you are always using it again if you enter information about your images .
the following idea is re@@ loc@@ ating the pictures within the list : if you are shown for example a family party and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be shown , so that the names are moved to above , which can find people faster and arrange .
if you prefer to receive a alphabetical list , click the symbol for sorting on date under the list .
if you select ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you may have to view all selected images and have images covered with notes . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons that are located below the preview of the picture on the right .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu option multiple entries once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . besides , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
in the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is a transi@@ tional sign , will be a special symbol .
in the context menu , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . in addition , you can also put an entry into a category and place there to order this to a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this requires you to alphabetical order of your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the brochure dialogue , click and post@@ p@@ one the boxes of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by setting off outside the window area .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs , you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... , which allows you to save the current assembly and appearance of the window .
you can also leave a frame fully automatically . if you want to display this window later again , use the button options ... and then click on the button . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select some images in the browser , you will receive an overview of preview pictures of the currently selected pictures , or of all images , if you don &apos;t have a filter . an example here you can see here . you can configure the size of the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . simply try it .
if you leave a picture in the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this picture is displayed in the picture viewer . if you have not opened any window with a picture viewer , a new display window is created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the corresponding pictures you want to delete and select either the removing key or select the menu Edit . now you can see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; C@@ photo@@ albums ; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use the pictures stored on the hard disk . of course , you need to download the pictures somewhere so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; if not all necessary pictures of the hard drive can be loaded .
pictures in which the right corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for example 5 @-@ 9 , the images are available , giving you the preview of these pictures . you can &apos;t watch the preview of these pictures . however , you can &apos;t watch these pictures with the picture viewer .
as you see this feature , you need to copy files from the folders and copy it again . &amp; C@@ photo@@ albums ; so it does not support you to avoid the inser@@ tion of the relevant CD . if you want to avoid anger , how to prevent your images in question , please purchase a larger hard drive to save all the pictures .
in the menu images , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that you can see for other un@@ locking and click on the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also see all pictures that can see your little sister , cont@@ our and select the menu entry Everything except in current view .
thus , you have set what images should be hidden in the case of your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , making all the pictures you blocked , hidden . if you want to check the pictures again , click lock .
it is also possible to specify a password to un@@ lock the pictures . to establish this password , select your password in your privacy .
please remember that this image protection is not certain if you can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml , read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text , or delete it . this type of password protection is only used to convert those with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; not very familiar to the view of private pictures .
the reason why you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; ad@@ minister and hours about hours to describe it is of course that you want to look at some point . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . this is why you can start a picture _ and video viewing . this is how you can start from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . of course it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter about the picture , e.g. who is on the image , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box is on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can drag this simply with the mouse and if any information is displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . then you can see the context menu ( see below ) .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have several pictures in the viewer you can switch between them and go back by using the keys picture high and picture down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and the end . these functions are also re@@ achable from the context menu .
when several pictures are loaded in the viewer you can run this as Di@@ asch@@ au . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then invites you to press a new picture after a few seconds . how often it loads a new picture can be checked by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus the tr@@ ash@@ ore by buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the entry button to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you can use the viewer you can use in the image and out it out . with the mouse you can easily pull out a rect@@ angle . with the Min@@ us button you can slide out the Plus button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the Point button , you can reset your zoom , so the image is not zo@@ omed . with the rec@@ lam@@ entation , the zo@@ oms sets the zo@@ oms so that every pixel is equivalent to a pixel aspect of the image .
note that the only zo@@ oming operations are working with videos that are in and out with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ t paste .
with the functions from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this doesn &apos;t work with videos . you can make comments on the current image with the menu option from the context menu .
if you look at pictures you can find a picture of a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . in the moment you can view the viewing and configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you &apos;ll notice the image to mark and see further pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you are one after the other .
for the two examples above gives you the opportunity to view pictures with tra@@ its while you watch them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature by setting the corresponding letters . see a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images , you can see them in your browser . so if you select all pictures you &apos;ve chosen , print or whatever you choose , so you can use a module to copy the selected pictures to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and particularly features can be displayed in fore@@ front view . if you display categories in D@@ re front view , then you can press features to the pictures , just press the letter for the feature , after the image was selected . you can see here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . this case allows you to paint &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; paint on the image .
the old man is not stored with the image , but in the database . on the way you can make your painted later .
in a picture you can see a painting on the painting . in order to paint the painting from the context menu , select the image from the context menu . to end the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar above on the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ant ; work , you need to control the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully @-@ controlled but the documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object characteristics and the object in the wire @-@ mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
you can also select several objects simultaneously , but not the object of a selected object , as all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position when you want to add the object and select either the symbol in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are more difficult positions , the following fol@@ dable menu will appear , so that you can choose the right position :
you can choose from the menu bar , either from the menu bar or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed features , click Apply to adopt these changes . if you have inv@@ alid values , a message is corrected with an error description . then you can read the input error and re @-@ use the changes with refuse .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed property .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you are editing a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview of your personal view .
press on preview in the concept @-@ view and a small sample of the scene is selected with the chosen item , even if you want a sub@@ ordin@@ ated element , even if you want to ren@@ dering a part of texture ( for example , a texture within a texture @-@ map and not the whole texture map ) , cross locally .
the screenshot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points and it will appear a small cross in the open @-@ scale view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and turning as well as the position for shifts . you can change the displacement by pulling with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a visual press model . you can only specify this value relative to the higher level of the higher object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visible level smaller or equal in the tool@@ bar of the scene of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ed@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object @-@ tree and the view of the object characteristics are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the default window , or if you need another arrangement , you can easily set them anywhere . you can also store multiple window orders and switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window on or under any view , drag the angle to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the collection to the right or left side of a view . the new view is an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on each other , drag the angle to another view . you can then switch between the views of clicking on the menu pop@@ s up in the views .
the last possible window arrangements are floating views : views that are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ oring place , drag the angle to the desktop or click on the small upward pointing arrow in the collection bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the collection bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view , you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are narrow@@ ed , you can anchor them at any location .
the current window view can be saved with window rules ... save . it will display a dialog where you can save the window arrangements under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ed@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ dering , this program has been installed correctly . as this manual is written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click the symbol ren@@ dering the symbol ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu view of the scene .
an R@@ ender @-@ mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to ren@@ ew a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you may insert many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of up to full quality images .
if you click on the symbol The R@@ ender Â® with the tool@@ bar or in the menu view R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender @-@ mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that can be seen in the mode of mode .
in the card size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render a small area of the image , choose the check box and enter the image output to the input fields .
in combination of quality , you can select the properties that uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . an exhaus@@ tive description of the R@@ ender properties find in the user guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is printed with a beam of pixels , different mistakes can be created . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ Ã¨ pattern or stage effects in ben@@ ds and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of this defect . in general pictures look better with this property .
when you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam of pixels . this technique is super sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adapted because each pixel is adap@@ tive , recur@@ sively , because each pixel is always divided again and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion@@ ing depth depends on the calculated colour values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray is a beam of pixels . if you adjust the default value of pixels with super sampling , both pixels will be calculated using a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you calculate the lowest value of pixels , a grid of 4x4 is calculated with an extra value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for Red , Green and Blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference is divided between the colour values , the pixels is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which will be individually persecuted and set to further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch J@@ it@@ tering , it changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular samples .
the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this card card you can adjust if the alpha @-@ channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the matching beams does not hit an object .
opens a new window for viewing the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import scene , select the file entry file ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ; not the full command @-@ range of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if , when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialogue window shows a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ant ; you want to import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to import the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import objects into the text file editor . to import objects into the scene , mark the source text editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ed@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray order is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ed@@ er ; a scene is ren@@ dering . usually this is P@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ P@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the help in your own view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ed@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed property . place here the path to your document and the version . supports the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ ups ) to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you enter files that are not in the folder , you must also apply the path to these files here . if a file is used in different ple@@ ads , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire @-@ type models . the second color is used for the display of selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected inspection points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type label .
you can adjust the points of the points on the buttons in the context menu of the wire @-@ related views . you can adjust the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and turn@@ outs .
larger values provide a better wire model and thus a better approach to the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball you can adjust the detailed level for two directions .
if you cross high fine detail for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you cross a wall , a wall becomes mounted behind the objects . the wall becomes displayed in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors .
when you cross ground , a ground is covered below the objects . the bottom is shown in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors .
if you cross the check@@ points , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for ren@@ dering the scenes . values for depth and swelling can be adjusted . more accurately , you can find in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page , you can change existing window arrangements or create new window orders . in the window arrangements , you can create and store window orders .
the combination field standard window arrangement : shows all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ed@@ er ; used the selected window arrangements at the start of the program .
the list of pre @-@ hand window orders displays all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement allows you to add button , and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
any window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views of the selected window arrangements . new views can be set with the button Add and delete selected views with the kno@@ b .
the position of the new window . with new column , you can create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ ts , you get a map view view together with the previous view and web@@ bing ens@@ hr@@ ined the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ed@@ er ; installed and now you would like to start with more accurate knowledge of both programs . if you want to follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate , simple scene , very popular among beginners : one ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings , before you complain about it , you should only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not adjust the camera , no rules can be applied for ren@@ dering , as a result you can get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have everything faul@@ t@@ less installed , you will see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ed@@ er ; the following pre @-@ configured window order :
take a little time to know the menus and the symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation , so you can get an appropriate performance of what you can expect from this program .
you will have to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ed@@ er ; start with a simple scene . to follow this manual , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . mark the scene and then select the menu entry . so you have a scene without objects .
the wire view shows how the camera sees all the scene that you create . in particular note that in the fourth wire view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view@@ point of the camera . this shows you the result of the Ren@@ der@@ ns scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the view properties , in which the different parameters of the camera will find . in the user documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find further details .
change nothing at the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that the camera can change in the view of the camera , with which you can change the target point of the camera , just click on a control point and drag it to the desired position .
if you push the button on users or the ONE G@@ AB@@ ET@@ AST@@ E , the wire model views and the object is immediately according to these settings . as a result , they look here the scene from the view@@ point of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you might add a string ( insert end@@ able body qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a variable method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ed@@ er ; indeed offers a simpler possibility . you can use an infinite plane as soil :
a good advice : select the object in the object tree , change the name and then press the button on users or the ONE . in the object tree , the new name will appear immediately .
the wire model view shows the level now , although at the moment only a limited end@@ ary level . if you render the scene , the plane extends up to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can click on the object + in front of the object . in this case , you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the various parameters for each new object : sc@@ aling , turning and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should shift the ground to exercise a unit below the horizontal line , just allow you to know some of these parameters . select shift , and set the values as follows :
just select the ground to insert its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something in the moment .
in both cases a dialog , in which you can select how the object should be inserted . you can then change the property in the property section ( name = ground pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , you can see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course , the preview of Pig@@ ments only shows a black material because you have to enter settings for the pig@@ ment yet . therefore , remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities for this , but now take the sim@@ pl@@ est .
if you don &apos;t see a color on Qu@@ ader and ball in the preview , click on the button users and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is right now . if you use your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
of course you are not the color scheme . here are another settings needed . in the color list you must use two new attributes ( you can also use this entry twice ( you can do this also more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , choose each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step you should already be able to perform , as you have seen the basic work of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ed@@ er ; the ball can be just as easy as to create the ground :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget IN@@ G@@ AB@@ ET@@ AST@@ E or to press the button ) so that the sphere would float above the floor , as you have post@@ pon@@ ed the floor around a unit after the bottom .
of course , ren@@ dering is now a strange result : as already seen before , the ball appears like a Matt@@ es black material . put in the following step a suitable material .
if you choose the ball you can point a material right now . as already in the floor , give the sphere a pig@@ ment as colour :
select your own object and change the name for example in the pig@@ ment . click on the pig@@ ment , then select insert and set the values as follows :
but you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish characteristics :
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on users or press SIN@@ G@@ AB@@ ET@@ AST@@ E .
the at@@ roph@@ y effect and reflection makes already some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected is :
you should now have a good impression of having the possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ed@@ er , offering . hopefully , you &apos;ve already learned something you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you ra@@ fting a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing , the ren@@ derer hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders scenes ) by every pixel in the scene . the ring is calculated as this beam appears to effect the visual effects of light sources in the scene and like atmospheric effects , such as ne@@ b@@ ula .
as you can imagine , you will see no camera without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you look at the scene . without a light source , you can see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene is supposed to be taken , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in standard file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously prepared with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; created
whenever you open a new model or create , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a storage space .
imagine the scene in the last stored version . all changes have been dis@@ car@@ ded since last storage .
you can only select this menu item , if you haven &apos;t stored any changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry , you can only select if you have processor feedback .
save the current window arrangement and opens a dialogue in which you enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you will find options for the setting of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ant ; , here you can change the look , the key short@@ cut and the default behavior .
open a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can modify this option default for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; change commands or add new .
does a dialog to set up the tool@@ bars . you can add and remove commands with this option tool@@ symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ases ; add commands .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to make rough surfaces without having to model any hi@@ ves on the surface and without changing the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ rical forms that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture @-@ map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel @-@ based , by applying a picture file as a colour map .
&amp; ball show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , where you can choose pictures to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window at the size of the image or screen mode .
the use of &amp; spher@@ es show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can view with clicking on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button Return .
you can adjust if any image should be displayed in one &apos;s own window , or if all images should always use the same window .
if you &apos;re looking for a specific file , simply type the first sign of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the right corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file is highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog box &amp; ball show ; there are five cart@@ on cards . in three of them , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can adjust the mode of work &amp; ball show ; in the two other , short order for the browser window , and short commands for your browser , the key short@@ cut can be specified for each window .
if this is selected , the pictures will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with background color , which you can adjust further below . default is not full screen mode .
is this point enabled , downloads &amp; ball show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still look at the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option , stores &amp; ball show ; with the name of the recently opened folder . at the next start &amp; ball show opens ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the coloured beams to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ball show ; so set up that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also represent the program .
with this option , the display window is increased to the full screen . this option is turned on as default .
determines if the slide show is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time span between the image change at a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
if the number of repe@@ ats is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated as long as it is broken down by the user . to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default setting is 1 .
change the key@@ note here for the various operating modes of &amp; spher@@ es ; in the box , short @-@ command box for the display window and brief command .
this option switch between the second @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for sub@@ folder and a window for files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large symbols for files in the folder . this ad is possible only in short order possible .
shows small symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is possible only in short order possible .
shows pioneer images for the files in the folder . this ad is possible only in short order possible .
shr@@ inks the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
aug@@ mented the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ball show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open .
view the picture in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame , which you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ piece photo ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; photo machining based on the &amp; digi@@ tised ; image processing . &amp; show@@ piece photo ; is part of &amp; digi@@ tised ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view and implement your photographs and correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; K@@ DE ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it is dependent on the user to join its part , at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ piece photo ; makes it just as easy as possible error or possible improvements . wherever you use this , your browser gives a page to reports about problems and wishes . all required information is completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to complete your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you want to make a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; ask and hope to answer other users of other users . in this mailing list , however , you should be spoken English , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best start to participate at &amp; show@@ photo ; in part , it is the developer mailing list . guidance for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ piece photo ; try to show you so much control over his work processes as possible . there are many options to make the behaviour of the show@@ case show ; set up on this settings , you &apos;ll need to press in eight pages . you can switch between these changes by pressing the symbols of the left side .
in the exposure indicators , you can select the color which is displayed if the lower or over@@ exposed indicators were selected . skill should display colours with what you are supposed to display , in contrast , a bright color and exposure should show a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; possesses a side bar at the right edge , which provides you important information and promotions at the selected pictures . the same side bar can also be found in the image processing . you can view this in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that no longer makes images to scan and to en@@ rich .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan and to en@@ rich images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog to save or save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display images from the store .
you can check the status of your scanner on the s@@ ane Project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be placed on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; if this scanner can not be opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , there will be a dialog to choose the scanner device .
the user can select the using scanner and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; exit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options .
in order to insert a picture , the user can only start a pre @-@ slip and then scan the scanning for the final scan . the pron@@ unci@@ ation will start by the preview @-@ button .
to select the image better , the user can zoom in and out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom that the complete preview can fit into the window .
when the image was selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if before the store is displayed in the settings , the image will be displayed in a preview window , as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image becomes saved and sh@@ lie ? en leads to a departure and you &apos;ll get back to the main window .
through the button settings the same name dialog is opened before the main window . you can change the main settings here .
the user can look at the image , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must display a preview before saving a preview . if this preview of users are not desired , the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images storing the dialog to save each image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , it will open automatically with a gener@@ alized name in a previously defined folder , then you must save saving without any fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored without any file name . if the images are stored in accordance with a fil@@ en@@ ame , this folder will be used as default for dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... changing .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for which automatically stored images and is moreover the designed name for the image in the dialog for saving . this automatically stored image gets a numer@@ ical suff@@ ix of each time counted , when a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
users can custom@@ ize image quality . this value also changes the compression value for saving . if Select the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t .
the button help sets the K@@ DE assistance with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button above starts the K@@ DE Over -@@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; The kno@@ b features the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; to end .

&amp; am@@ arok ; used like all other programs button . below , you will find a list of these short@@ cut and select your function . you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts to the player window and define the Global button lets you pick up using the right mouse button in the Player window and select short@@ cut .
you may possibly set up existing multimedia keys to set up that they work as &amp; am@@ arok ; -@@ Short command . by doing so , make your keyboard to &amp; am@@ arok ; -@@ control centre .
the D@@ COP @-@ interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which are mostly mentioned in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists browser and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ COP @-@ function break may be &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; in addition , Amar@@ ok still has some own command @-@ line options .
you should give a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check your script if all the necessary modules are present and use dialog to make users know why a script does not run .
Beg@@ in require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue error = &apos; cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE binding ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is Re@@ quired for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in scripts / template , you will find a lot of Templ@@ ate scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a base for your own scripts or simply expand the required functions . you will quickly find that writing of scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ COP you can exchange your scripts to Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should lie in every K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execute of external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be accessed . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is relatively easy to be called . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ arok ; send noti@@ fications to all current scripts . for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their standard entry and react to events . of course , a script may ignore the events if there is no use for this .
configure We@@ ak is the script to preview the dialog box . to store the store and loading of the setup data each script must take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the folder on the folder where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change signal that a new piece is played . the script might now be &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP @-@ functions further information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ izing the script to the selected files of play@@ list , if a user @-@ defined menu entry may also be used , so that the script can use the cli@@ cked entry . to remove one entry you can use d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script re@@ mo@@ ve@@ .@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ p ) .
before &amp; am@@ arok ; or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ arok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do so , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that can be compressed by a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can be optionally compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can optionally be seen as Amar@@ ok@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 , so that the user can recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; am@@ arok ; 1.3 will only accept the script packages using the extension amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages like correctly .
the main thing is to be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameters -@@ p to obtain the file &apos;s rights :
if your script package is finished , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and follow the link to the wi@@ ki script page by &amp; am@@ arok ; app@@ . for your entry on K@@ DE @-@ apps you should use the category am@@ arok ; scripts .

similar interpre@@ ts : after activ@@ ating this setting is called &amp; am@@ arok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the each piece played by . note : you do not need any last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information please visit the summary of functions and gallery screen photos .
am@@ aro@@ K requires only the package c@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including those included in it , because modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide , how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs .
some features , such as the O@@ SD , notice that your window manager will function of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org , so , however , flu@@ x@@ box will function for example . we try to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library to days . you can check this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang the broken file , which has caused the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file , and let the collection make another .
mostly this is the fact that Tag@@ li@@ b crashing : in reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file crashing : please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for in &amp; am@@ arok ; is something mature .
make sure that all of &amp; am@@ arok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version , e.g. &amp; am@@ arok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then leads to crash when editing the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then turn off the machine . turn off if in@@ active for ... in the setting of sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically with a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash , then you will receive a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many program data is writing as UTF @-@ 8 into met@@ a @-@ information , but this is not as Unicode identi@@ fying . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; Die file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : Mp@@ ha@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error in writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; am@@ arok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ petition / dynamic play@@ list ) is always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects can be forgotten in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can see the status disabled to grey and half @-@ transparent . note that in some cases up to three times a symbol must click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check if am@@ aro@@ K uses the correct Q@@ t library . you can see with the ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ di@@ zing Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that am@@ aro@@ K is the correct version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems clari@@ fy yourself at the easiest by helping an expert on your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux @-@ Distribution . you can also search for help with other users or from the developers . use the Forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # am@@ arok on .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please only wear a mistake if something is on the correction of an error in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; am@@ arok ; only an empty play@@ list will appear . how do music come in ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intuitive , the Start window was transformed into the window window . you &apos;ll find it under Extras statistics .
the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are awarded for the user &apos;s rating , while points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces , the play@@ list has to be shown in the play@@ list of play@@ list and select a column list . click here to determine the rating for a piece . you can also use the short command of Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press release on your keyboard . or click on your selection and select Rem@@ ove from the Swi@@ vel menu .
drag a play@@ lists file with the mouse to the play@@ list and let them fall there , just as you would do it with other files . that &apos;s what it is : - )
in the tool@@ bar of play@@ list , right next to the Add @-@ button , the button is play@@ list . click on it .
probably you are missing the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el and install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el package and install &amp; am@@ arok ; new . look even after lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the Equalizer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . additionally , you will find it via the menu bar under Extras Equalizer ....
no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; am@@ arok ; uses one from the back@@ end @-@ independent approach , hence the real question . what media types does support G@@ ud@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ mm / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support as pretty much any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even code text and P@@ NG !
it can be ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , where@@ with default no MP3 decoder are supplied ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE , SIN@@ G@@ AB@@ ET@@ AST@@ E
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; am@@ arok ; MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the belt driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must use a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( e.g. S@@ B@@ live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software @-@ Mixer ) .
the issue of this command should help you in search of the problem cause and help in a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may have to specify another S@@ ink ( eg@@ . sink ) .
the does &amp; am@@ arok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must be de@@ coded first . one MP3 is not easy to listen to AL@@ SA . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ code them and send the PCM data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend right on AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open the Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ ori@@ ety ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see the next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure art@@ el@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that may cause to create playback . read this bug report . read this bug report in your AL@@ SA installation file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either you use not the Arts Dri@@ vers , but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia complete around the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
presumably , use the Arts Dri@@ vers . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the d@@ olls in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less contracts react to visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; am@@ arok ; off . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all components . execute G@@ ST regi@@ sters to register all of the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , comp@@ ile and install it . then use G@@ ST register , once as a system administrator and once as your normal user . delete the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stra@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST register again . start now &amp; am@@ arok ; .
please report under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ .@@ . if you have a full list of suggestions / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : am@@ arok @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; am@@ arok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . furthermore , the name contains the magical K ... : )
thanks to D@@ COP , this is already possible . place an alarm in your calendar program and let you run with the alarm to this command : d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok player play
this command makes &amp; am@@ arok ; starting up . make sure that &amp; am@@ arok ; runs before you go to bed , then you &apos;ll have stopped by the gentle tones of music , which you have stopped in front of bed .
how can one discover the currently in &amp; am@@ arok ; ongoing title , if you are working on another computer ?
if a working SS@@ H environment is available , you can proceed as follows : this command gives you interpre@@ t and titles of the current piece : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ us@@ ername am@@ arok player now@@ Pl@@ aying
replace IP address with your IP and your current user name with your user name . this assumes that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA is present .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; am@@ arok ; -@@ windows are separated . press on the keyboard , and the current analyst opens in an independent , in the size of changeable windows .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + rights Mau@@ st@@ aste makes a piece in the chin @-@ up sequence in the queu@@ es . by pushing the SIN@@ G@@ AB@@ ET@@ AST@@ E following a search in play@@ list , the first search result is played and the search reset .
OK , the player window , and the play@@ list have tri@@ ck@@ rich functions , but how does it look like with the symbol in the system section of the control bar ?
click using the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which brow@@ sers are to be displayed .
my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the launch of am@@ aro@@ K , the database database can not be created and on the console many error messages appear . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; am@@ arok ; doesn &apos;t work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ arok on a local drive , or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
put the CD , then click on audio CD . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . to normal retri@@ eval , you pick up a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . to automatically coding files from the folder mp3 or og@@ g .

basically , this will fit the previous evaluation with a decl@@ ining value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has received every single rating on the overall result .
you can insert the evaluation of a piece by clicking on a column title in the play@@ lists window . here mark evaluation . then you can press the evaluation of a piece as well as all the other attributes , by clicking on the piece and edit : evaluate or edit F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the dialog met@@ ad@@ ata .
the developers don &apos;t want to inform you when you are supposed to publish a stable version of am@@ aro@@ K . this means K@@ DE packages have a fixed publishing plan of not to be combined with the short @-@ term plan of am@@ aro@@ K .

if you want to use AL@@ SA , please refer to the latest versions available . old AL@@ SA versions have caused a lot of trouble and thus a lot of error reports .
presumably &amp; am@@ arok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ amer . therefore , the / configure routine is not compiled . you need to configure and install this output modules .
now I am &amp; am@@ arok ; new installed , but the output modules are still not yet available . and now ?
presumably , use a distribution that is installed separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary development files are missing . the same applies to x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ dev@@ el . afterwards , you need to re@@ comp@@ ile and install .

under the tool@@ bar is a search area which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden , which do not correspond to your search criteria .
in the bottom part of the file browser you can find a address bar where you can enter music from a given URL . if you want to enter music from a given URL , you can access music in the music file musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can leave the music from there into the play@@ list .
if the play@@ list is longer than in the window , the trailer of files can be extremely difficult . in this case , the strength of the shift key can be helpful . in this case , the strength of the shift key can be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the bottom position .
the play@@ list contains all of you to dis@@ able pieces . you can change the sequence by typ@@ ing the entries simply by the mouse to the desired position . once you enter the letter , only the pieces will contain . to reset the filter , press the button so long the back button , until the text box is empty .
if you typ@@ ed by space characters separate search terms , &amp; am@@ arok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries , one , two and three .
if you are looking between the search terms OR are searched for entries , which either contain one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all the pieces are found , one or two or three included ( or a combination of it ) .
if you want to look for entries , the spaces are included , then reverse the search key with go@@ ose down : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that Mike Old@@ field , but not according to entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search engine , you may also search for larger or smaller . for example : review : &gt; 50 This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece , which contains a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : - something looks for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these synchron@@ variants according to exposure . example : Mike Old@@ field OR scores : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bath . this is searching for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment bad .
you can set the sequence sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then click on the right mouse button in the desired order to click on the entries . the entries will then receive a marking with a number . the number is equivalent to the order in which the pieces will be restored .
the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list is located at the bottom edge of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the play@@ list . on the left , you will find the button Add , with which you can easily store the play@@ list , play@@ list empty and random@@ ized mixing .
next , the buttons will follow and restore . so you can make changes to the play@@ list or restore .
in the center of the tool bar is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refresh@@ er rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you can get in the player window on the right mouse button . via this menu you can set up &amp; am@@ arok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are still many more available buttons for tool@@ bar , for example , ren@@ dition control and volume control . you can set up the displayed button by clicking on menu and select tool@@ bars .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the current piece for play@@ list . it displays the title of current play , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and playback can simply change by clicking with the mouse double in the corresponding display area .
you can also display the status bar . in addition , the status bar will display the status bar in the general settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the play@@ list on menu . via this menu , you can reach the Settings menu .
a click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alization plug@@ ins . you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; am@@ arok ; select .
behind this entry , a sub @-@ menu hi@@ des with links to this document and other information about &amp; am@@ arok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool to manage your cover images . you can start it by choosing actions cover @-@ administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list of all records in your collection . you can view all albums of a interpre@@ ter in your collection by selecting the interpre@@ t on the left .
with the menu view , you can choose what should be displayed in the cover administration . select from :
the queu@@ e administration received your great train in &amp; am@@ arok ; 1.3 . with this function , you have even more control over the play@@ list . this number represents the order in which &amp; am@@ arok ; the pieces will play at : 1 will be played first , 2 as second , and so on .
the management of queu@@ es open , open the queu@@ e and then click on + . you can also add the pieces in the play@@ list and then click on + . you can also add the pieces using the mouse , or the context menu in the play@@ list . the order of the pieces can then change in the queu@@ e administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ given ( the details to set up this later ) .
fills your play@@ list with random pieces from your entire collection and adds further random pieces during playback .
add pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( previously : audio cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires some pieces in your play@@ list . you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to this dynamic play@@ list .
just click on the desired play@@ list , drag them into the play@@ list window or click on the right mouse button . in this way , your current play@@ list will be replaced by the new play@@ list . so , you should save the old play@@ list under circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set modes of random mix and play@@ lists mix immediately complete your play@@ list and you can add at least one piece self from your collection . the recommended pieces will ever be added at the next piece change , so your play@@ list will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to reserve the current play@@ list , then activate the latest dynamic mode : settings dynam@@ ically mode . this will use your existing play@@ list as starting point . via the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be disabled .
the button New fill up the current play@@ list and adds new pieces according to dynamic mode . play@@ list opens the dialog to edit the play@@ list and you can change the respective settings .
with a right click on a dynamic play@@ list , you have the opportunity to edit , click Edit . then the dialog to edit the list of play@@ list .
enter here any name for the play@@ list . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your play@@ list will grow continuously , the setting for coming pieces will survive and they will not be able to hear in this play@@ list . if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed under regard to the setting of play@@ mate pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces to be kept at the beginning of the play@@ list . so you can easily see what plays recently played .
this is the number of pieces added after each played piece for play@@ list . if you have more than 1 , the play@@ list is continuously growing , because only one piece is played and can be removed .
the settings on the right side have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can already cross existing play@@ lists and smart play@@ lists . if you cross several play@@ lists , &amp; am@@ arok ; random pieces from each of the booked play@@ lists .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can custom@@ ize the settings by clicking the script and click on the setup .
you can install new &amp; am@@ arok ; and install the script by clicking on the script . it will open a select dialog to install a script package to install . you can also install new scripts directly from the internet . use the button Other scripts .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . choose to delete the script then click D@@ ein@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing own scripts , please refer to the writing of scripts .
the dialog window visu@@ alization plug is used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; am@@ arok ; used . the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . in order to use a plug @-@ in , enable the check box next to the name .
this quick guide should show you how to create with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps a audio CD . to complete the steps you need to have a loud installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files .
this is a dialogue window that you can select which files you want to burn on CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ s@@ less compressed formats , then remember how high the bit@@ rate is generated , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is generated . you can check whether an audio CD of a los@@ s@@ less format was created . use the au@@ d@@ CD@@ t@@ ect project .
in this dialogue window , you can do nothing . please wait until the machine has completed the burning process .
this quick guide should show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to complete the steps you need to have a loud installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have put the qu@@ ell CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , select Extras , copy CD ... from the menu . you can now see a dialogue with the possible settings .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; settings made , press the button Start . you can now see a dialog like that or something like this :
in this dialogue window , you can track the progress of copying process . once the original copy of the original is completed into the image file , you will be asked after an empty CD @-@ medium to which the data is burned .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must now wait until the total step has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must now wait until the total step has reached 100 % .

the web site of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found under www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org . there you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in addition , you can get rid of the feedback from mutual aid from the forums and news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 and Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in one flow ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ Once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; cd@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burn all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; cd@@ record ; provides all the functions that are also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; usually cho@@ oses &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually cho@@ oses &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality with heavy audio CDs .
cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for the output of digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . these are basically called Ri@@ pper .
OGG Vor@@ bis Library : OGG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio streaming . OGG pre @-@ profit from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ o@@ der@@ - and Encoder modules .
mad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
lame : a widely developed MP3 Decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . lame will be used by the MP3 en@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio coder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Lib@@ sn@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : further libraries for the processing of different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible for example to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burning them on an audio CD .
SO@@ X : a program that may convert between different audio formats and convert . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio Encoder module .

V@@ CD@@ Imag@@ er : a fully equipped author system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
Nor@@ mali@@ ze : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , for creating mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections , the different recording of the different albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect , which can be played differently loud .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small lin@@ ux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and play automatically all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge projects again . the accompanying sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry brings the project .
stores the current project . if the project has been saved once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is required after a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
stores the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed , with which you can choose folder and file name for the Project file .
stores all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file .
includes the current project . if a project has changed and not saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; according to what has to happen . you can then dis@@ connect between saving and changes . in addition , you can also break off and keep the project so open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each stored project will in@@ qu@@ ire what should happen to happen , just as if you would have called for each project file .
closes all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each stored project will be asked what to happen , as if you had called the file .
when you call this entry , you can download the files to add to the project . this has the same effect when you draw the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the file format will appear in the basis folder of the CD .
open the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burn , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialog can only open if the project has already contains data .
open the properties dialog for the current project . here you can use many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are the ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only on an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . it &apos;s useful when you use files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is useful if you don &apos;t use files for a multi @-@ session CD . it &apos;s useful for you to see them rather than help , so that you can see the files existing on the medium already existing files and folders .
this entry appears only for an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it displays only the previously imported files again .
opens the CD copy dialog . this enables even without project file copying a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also want to burn a CD to another medium . alternatively , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copy dialog . this also allows the option to create copying a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use only a picture of a DVD with help of copying dialog . alternatively , the target medium will be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW drive . so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW drive .
open the dialog for form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialogue you can format a DVD Â± R ( W ) , so the contents will be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you write the choice between the writing modes and In@@ cre@@ ment@@ ell .
burns a previously specified CD image . the dialog can be burned directly after a * .@@ iso , * .@@ rescue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pushing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , so you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burning a DVD copy . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pushing the burning button .
a DVD video can be converted to a DVD video . this dialogue window is usually used after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used all@@ standing . it contains information about the outside video , coding settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the ingredients view and include properties of the media , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a little LEICA is displayed at the bottom edge of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
turns on folder view a or out . folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , sper@@ ms and un@@ lock the drive or ej@@ ection of the media .
turns on the content view , or out . the contents view makes the interface and drag files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if one drive was selected using a corresponding CD / DVD in folder view .
sh@@ uts the head@@ strip in the project view , or out . the head@@ bow is a narrow@@ er area which is only visible when the projection screen has no real function , it looks pretty pretty and separates the projec@@ tile view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialogue window for changing the key orders for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after you choose one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the code order below .
this will kick off the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup assist@@ ants . thus , you can insert the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the boot manager ( root ) .
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . here , general program settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is designed for Person@@ alize and Advanced .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many others &amp; K@@ DE ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you can use either the command @-@ line program d@@ co@@ p , or that &apos;s a bit more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the function@@ all@@ ity , so rather your taste and the type of your tasks are crucial , which will give the help of the programs .
in this chapter , we assume that you use command @-@ line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions you have to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then give something like the following at the console :
besides the General &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have all &amp; K@@ DE ; program have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below .
the Standard D@@ COP @-@ interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and further functions to create new projects .

as a result of such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface curr@@ ent@@ Project Through using this reference it is possible to change the project about K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above en@@ listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface which is applicable only on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
the cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) , cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) , add@@ res@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) . add@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) , re@@ mo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ Name ) , set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String path )
therefore , it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders , and then insert files into the new folder :

&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Exec@@ ution for &amp; K@@ DE ; with him can easily be saved audio CDs ; s read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder of the machine installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the output of &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and from many co@@ di@@ ers that supports this WAV files ( compressed ) files ( This co@@ ders packages must be installed from lin@@ ux distribution ) . more co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or even in other formats such as los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , read out the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used . nearly every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must now be done .
for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ ders have already been installed . however , all these programs are usually not necessary to comp@@ ile something itself . but if FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is not necessary .
which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er- / file format should be used ? chapter The Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and com@@ pressing factors .
a word to copy the copy of protected audio CDs ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this program is not intended to avoid any copy protection . if not , it is not possible to b@@ ail a protected audio CD ; it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanisms of Cop@@ y protection . avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CDs ; s !
while setting up only one needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , afterwards the daily use of reading a CD ; to the hard drive explains . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the s@@ limmer of user interface concerning which you are often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert in many formats - depending on which co@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the free@@ DB from the Internet or can work fully without a network , where everything will be captured manually .
this is only a short list of commands of the main window . on the page step for step example , further information , such as this program will be used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program configuration .
if the CD@@ DB is available on request by the CD @-@ Data , according to the CD@@ DB regi@@ sters , it can be stored locally or online , in the latter case first the connection to the internet . )
starts out and - if an en@@ coder is configured in the Code Settings tab in the setup software - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , allowing the selection with another Encoder as the standard can be read . it is to note that previously the en@@ coder is configured in the Code Settings tab in the setup dialog .
open the file manager , so it is already selected to en@@ code a complete file instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the dialog box to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programs ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
open the main setting dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as en@@ coder , for inser@@ ting the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you need to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ ders and compression rates and helps you in choosing the right Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
if no audio information is to go lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices can use these files .
among the audio formats , you lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences are less important because both co@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , lame will still be included with most distri@@ butions free , but there are open license questions
+ high up very high quality quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality at deeper bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG files are present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - beginning 2009 - support these devices only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting yields good transparency to most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and something less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approx . 5.5 . requires 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR , stereo stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music by adolescents , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Insul@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this attitude will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that will be entered manually or by the program automatically from the free@@ DB program , are available as a list of parameters . you can be delivered / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; and the code program to create folder and file names , as well as the features of music files .
in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ als there is often a combination of program settings for the co@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the code readers explain the switch for these programs .
for example , add the &amp; CD ; title to the keyword ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are coded with lame , the switch -@@ tt is to be added by lame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ d { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people can read / enter the information up / enter , so that all the other information can be downloaded from yourself into the calcul@@ ator . it is to note that here only from text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; however , no more or less valuable , so the information can be added to the music company any more or less , so any information can be obtained from the music company via a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is actively to choose a cross @-@ box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address can &apos;t be used when calling the server ( This can only know the programmer who has reviewed the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; for use of free@@ DB , the ge@@ ographic on the next floor mirror server will be needed . this saves bandwidth on the network and compar@@ es the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current listing of Spiegel@@ ser@@ ver@@ n for online retri@@ eval &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( generally monthly ) only the upgra@@ des of the database .
which book program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files to my computer ?
there is rum@@ ors that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia will be used , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for the reading of audio cd ; . to note is that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed , if this is not yet happened .
to save the printed WAV files , the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be chosen and thus the desired file format . in the first opening are pre@@ defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab . other co@@ ders can be added to this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined Ko@@ di@@ erer . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are in the chapter world co@@ ders .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers you can obtain more information about his switches by entering a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . must &apos; lame &apos; will be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
that can have a lot of causes . check the device configuration of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read and whether both cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio co@@ ders of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could give a hint on what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , do this tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , everything understood , but are somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that you want to let the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and use our first &amp; CD ; read &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keyword ( tags ) .
there must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as compiled packages for your lin@@ ux distribution . an appropriate package for lame can be found as a non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files that you can always do .
please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory consists and that you have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something into the conversation ) .
the first section handles the basic set of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something probably is done only once and
the second section describes the procedure to read out an &amp; CD , which must be repeated for any editing &amp; CD ;
here we determine the using co@@ ders for compression of music ( lame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) and the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet download .
even though we can change these settings at any time , we are probably not able to change it with any &amp; CD ; change when the matching settings are found .
the device designation is delivered to the selection program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can read .
often / dev / c@@ drom a symbolic link to the real device model of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the signature map General Settings . here you can &apos;t do much to do . here , an additional conversion cannot be defined . in our example , everything will be loaded / entered as shown in the screenshot .
only if you want to ask for in@@ complete information , so that you will be informed if data are missing ( tags ) .
the card card CD ; settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and release the &amp; CD ; data automatically via the internet of a free@@ DB machine .
note : the computer must be connected during the reading &amp; CD ; it can be connected to the internet , so that it can access the free@@ DB server .
the second selective field is simpler , a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately the reading &amp; CD ; . this is slightly satisfied with the database entry and the en@@ listed directory names / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , can be easily changed . der directories and fil@@ en@@ ame will be changed with cont@@ act@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; Tag@@ ger .
in addition to this example , if you want to set everything manually , turn the select fields and free@@ DB is not used . however , this is about 620 MB big , consider this twice as it is worthwhile . to free@@ DB in the offset mode , the two selection fields have to be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the map card .
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from free@@ DB server about the internet . how does the system know which data the disc should get ? read the section about free@@ DB . do everything like it is shown in the screenshot .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with remote database on the internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org site and look for a mirror server in your vicinity . on this way the burden is distributed between the machines . however , this attitude will work as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , but there are many fire@@ walls the protocol 88@@ 80 standard@@ ly bo@@ ck@@ le , there is maybe more happiness with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf in the internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to transfer any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first check box should be sufficient .
simply take the settings from the screenshot . ( make sure the file / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , is there a reason why more than one at the same time at only one existing drive ? parallel reading and en@@ code ? the author knows it not , therefore simply try .
CD ; check out the last piece : cross this in around the &amp; CD ; throwing at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you cross this , then the path / folders cannot be stored in which the wav files are stored . if only space is available on another drive . if the field is not checked , the files will not be created in a private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files .
everything you enter as it is on the screen . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances , something must be blind@@ ed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , it is sufficient for very good audio @-@ quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is sufficient for example 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . it reached a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the tags &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . Kid@@ ney is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; K@@ DE ; in case a later modification of the tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest like in the screenshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of parallel WAV files : at a du@@ al@@ core or quad@@ ru@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a wav file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic set of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each output of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organisation structure of your music , you will never need to change them again .
in this section , described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard drive , we will create MP3 files . first , a connection to the internet is established , as we are convenient and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will want to pick up . the process of this section is described in this section , must be repeated for each out@@ sour@@ ced &amp; CD ;
since we have a &amp; CD , which is not included in free@@ DB , see the screen photos a bit different than the data for a &amp; CD ; with successful of free@@ DB de@@ fo@@ ed data . therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of retri@@ eving them from the Internet . comments are point to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is to find out . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , the &amp; CD now has to be defined in the drive , which was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen . this is only if the CD ; the audio CD can be identified and by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia can be read .
if this is not happening then you are looking for questions and answers to the assistance , or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the disc has been collected from free@@ DB , all titles of the pieces are already filled out , and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; gives a window appears , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best to your &amp; CD ;
if you have chosen the check box for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the Settings ) , you can also rede@@ em it manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have any local database , but take data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - entry of the CD data and the title of the first piece
specify the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Update title &apos; , the rest of the data in the &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist does not have to be entered in the &quot; Current Title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ v@@ ents per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments , common to all the pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful call of data from free@@ DB , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor , so that you can not only start with the artist and album names ( e.g. whether all words begin with big letters or not ... ) , but also to verify if there are any undes@@ i@@ red remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags ; maximum allowed . this option is set up on the code tab . take a look at the section called &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of generated files later with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with him you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see Help for the Ko@@ di@@ erer to get more information .
simply select one entry , which is obvious with the style of the chosen disc . in this example , this is not important because we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information , go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are under rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second one .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you can see that the fields for the album has already been filled with the entered data we &apos;ve collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the items of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and process the same way until you have entered all the titles of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from free@@ DB . it is already sorted in one of these categories of database .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown above the denom@@ inations .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . just the titles that are selected are read . just a simple click on the line will select the selection of the piece , or select the button all tracks on the bottom edge of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
by clicking on the button selection of reading the reading process , this window appears on confirmation . click OK and then we will have a look at the window with the entries and follow what is running out .
click on the tab for switching on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly beneath the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is being read on the hard drive . status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message you will see if you &apos;re trying to work with a co @-@ erer you do not have installed . pieces which have not been successfully en@@ coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the finish file are not what we have entered here in the example . have you tested if you write a write access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it &apos;s finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 to the format MP3 . so , reading and en@@ code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has found no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behaviour is the number of parallel processes to read and en@@ code . when powerful machines the result is un@@ clear . the calcul@@ ator with a am@@ d@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous interpre@@ ting and en@@ code ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out , while another piece is en@@ coded and a third order is en@@ coded in the queu@@ e . after the last piece is en@@ coded , a small window with a message appears in the upper left of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ - or 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the code of your choice .
if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can download it within the &amp; K@@ DE ; however , if you are using CV@@ S , you can already download a compiled Package . most distri@@ butions are already a pre @-@ compiled Package . if you read this , you have probably done it already ...
this section is directed to individuals that comp@@ ile by source files , and not for users that use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program your needs can be adapted once , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , has many variants of settings . the best you can read the step by step example to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the various map cards of settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still on reading ? even if only the help menu is cli@@ cked on the first start of the program , without any reference point as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive is ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it ? who reads this , probably started the program . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t count this manual . it is a first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is thought to do something useful or change it . at least after contact with the author . and if you read this , he got this section and is therefore understood with this proposal .
strange when you managed to get the source file from &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the Mi@@ di@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ er of &amp; K@@ DE ; besides others he has not have real @-@ time graphic and karaoke @-@ real @-@ display of texts , also some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; K@@ DE ; support also on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; K@@ DE ; support also the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project driver , which is required for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included , as soon as it supports a sequ@@ en@@ zer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the song text on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of every MIDI channel as by high@@ lighting the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can find in &amp; K@@ DE ; any MIDI file from one &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows can be drawn up .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or tex@@ tures ) . K@@ Mid automatically determines the procedure used .
sitting support . if you finish &amp; K@@ DE ; end of playing a song , kick starts with the same song again next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , which you can choose the desired song .
you can also drop a file from one &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows in the &amp; k@@ mid window ; -@@ Windows also works with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and bet@@ ting the button shut@@ down in the tool bar , select the entry bott@@ ling from the menu item or enter the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you draw it on the &amp; k@@ mid window . ( in several pieces it will be added to a collection and then played each other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece is play@@ ful , you can use an arbitr@@ ary spot by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows at left and right of the speed display and change the recording speed . to get the original pace again , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar or the select menu entry in the menu , inter@@ rup@@ ts the playback . enter the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use tex@@ tures , others use lyrics and again other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events are supposed to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically calculated that you have to set nothing manually . so , if you select anything manually , the karaoke text is selected , but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other kind .
if you want to set up an event type , select the Settings menu or push @-@ ups from the menu settings . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ise . these will be played in the turn . in this section , how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . here you will find in the menu Collection below the item ... Click on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the bund@@ led in the collection manager .
into the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . remember when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song using the button . again , again the file dialog , with which you can choose the desired song .
a second method to add a song , depends on the adjustment Automati@@ cally add to the collection .
if automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece will be added to the active collection using the opening file ( open or drag &amp; drop ) .
when Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not enabled , the opening of a piece is activated and cleared . this collection will then be added to the open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click .
you can select the sequence in which the songs will be played . if you select the series from the lower menu sequence of the menus , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be fixed .
to play a song , select it at the collection manager , or use the select list on karaoke text .
to jump one song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu , or press the button arrow right .
to get the vice versa a song , select the button fore@@ going piece , record previous piece from the menu , or press the button arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the delete collection and click on the kno@@ b .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , that doesn &apos;t matter , since it is not stored at the leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is necessarily necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events in events that understands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map , which conver@@ ts all events of the Change Her@@ patch to B@@ right Piano in events of type Change patch to tr@@ ump@@ et and therefore always sound a trumpet when originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ map because all sound cards GM are compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required adjust@@ ments for playing a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear so often as desired . however , is that every occurr@@ ence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of the key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email , so I in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices that are not General MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section , as the patches of General MIDI is illustrated on your specific keyboard , the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equation will ignore . it is believed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you can &apos;t change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all the sounds that supports this instrument on the clay with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a drum ( e.g. with tone 60 ) , which can be like a thread . do the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant to form a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one that means the sound height of the always same drum ( like some keyboards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify how sounds are illustrated on a certain channel or instrument .
like at P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you must only use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are mainly used to form sounds on the wi@@ per channel . check out as an example the supplied key@@ maps .
this section can be used to ex@@ ert some channels to others . if you want to change the first and second channel , make it quite simply in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered between 0 to 15 , constructed according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is displayed on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be used for this channel . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will be ignored , which try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , the patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example , to always use the wi@@ per patch on the per@@ col@@ der canal .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates , in which proportion of Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events will be multiplied and then the value is to be for@@ warded to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) , and then the value of 40@@ 96 is used to be no dec@@ imal ( in the map file ) .
this attitude will be used because GM proposed that a keyboard , which is a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der Event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , try to play some keyboards up to a oc@@ tave above . in order to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings
the Kan@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole series of piano ( one for each MIDI channel ) . you can see what sounds are played straight .
you can also use the edge view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument , the button doesn &apos;t light green but red to show that no longer is the original instrument .
the channel view ( up to now ) has two different views to show the played sounds . view the Settings menu under the Point Kan@@ al@@ view : settings
the pace @-@ LCD displays speed , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the higher the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . so , for example , you can find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows on the left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . thus , the same MIDI file can result in two different devices , as well as two different musicians can play the same scores in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have the control of everything .
this can happen if you have a binary ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; that has happened because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support was compiled . to remove the problem , you need to download and install a source of source ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home ) .
I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately .
understand , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid window .
in advance , activate the automatic adjustment to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to temporary collection .
you can switch the arrow key to the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the default temp@@ o you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have been open on one &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; in this mode , if I want to play a karaoke file , or I &apos;m going to play a file , only into the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to change and select the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; draw .
if you want to listen to a file quickly , without adding it to a collection , turn off automatic Add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . open files
let us assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first , you only want to play the first file . so , set the adjustment Automati@@ cally Add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then you dis@@ connect to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . all heart@@ felt thanks ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , animated me on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ xis ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m not a lot of leisure time for my Hob@@ bies , but I &apos;m trying to take a little time . as a hobby , I try to collect MIDI files , make music and show sentences .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make a huge anticip@@ ation when you send me a postcard from your home or a Mi@@ di@@ - / karaoke file from a local group . if you want to send a postcard or a MIDI file , if you want to send a MIDI file , you should contact me because I already have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; complete in my spare time and won &apos;t support money for this . I want to empha@@ size that I only want to re@@ programming users because / if I receive feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. BÃ¼h@@ ler - correction of error that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
my thanks also applies to Jose L@@ us Sanchez for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Garcia for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Garcia , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error message or even a supp@@ or@@ tive email .
and of course , my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the web to give us this wonderful Mi@@ di@@ - and karaoke files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on its homepage , which can be found under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ .@@ html / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can search the development , search and look at photos . there are also links to pages with other karaoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use an FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have any sound card , you need to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL , it works as if you would have a sound card except you can not hear music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files that supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on formats , as well as to play DVD &apos;s , VCD or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; coffee name ; was not finished yet as &amp; K@@ DE ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; K@@ DE ; user mailing list .
the window of application is formed out of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the play@@ list . and finally there is an information window that will only appear when information is listed .
it is possible to en@@ rich the preferred connections under the menu reading sign but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which should be played after each other , so you should use the category permanent play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hier@@ archi@@ es . if you copy an entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups are copied to the current category , and playback will begin with the requested entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and continuous play@@ list may also be modified by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do if &amp; k@@ m@@ player / etc . , the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / , can also select from the menu view and as next edit mode . thanks to the click of a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this particle is displayed .
after changing XML files , the play@@ list must be chosen by the play@@ list and select either the edit mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost if the edit mode leave or another group is selected without the play@@ list .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched on by modi@@ fying the XML configuration files ..
the animation during starting and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ taining option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can easily be inserted .
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; share the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ d@@ player / ex@@ m@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be an supported XML file .
the animation during the starting doesn &apos;t need to be short , it will be automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be trou@@ bl@@ es@@ ome at the end of animation . however , the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the ads of a favorite photos ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; IM@@ G dur = &quot; in@@ struct &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ guards ; In the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; included in the tests testing / some examples of S@@ MIL the by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; supported .
there is a tab for the configuration of M@@ Player in configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here , the path is set by the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bl@@ es@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of M@@ Player clearly .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual processing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here &apos;s an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted into the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages must play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime @-@ type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is in a consol@@ es application and search for error messages to browse the browser library . if no error occur , the back@@ end output is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
therefore always a given back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this has been determined ) , it must be done by manual change the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ ey should play any of the og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play on TV cards , either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( you need k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) before TV can be configured to use the device and the TV channels . this can be edited from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in k@@ m@@ player can use the dialog in the settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected , of which one has to be selected . ( e.g. , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB in it .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ video , it should also be supported on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension has to be functioning as well . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server it is necessary to use the X@@ Free@@ 86 server in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally they are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources used by K@@ M@@ Player . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this d@@ v@@ d@@ nav@@ source , d@@ v@@ d@@ source , t@@ v@@ ed@@ usa , t@@ v@@ source , source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin to play the play@@ list .
are there clu@@ es how I can qui@@ eter my CD@@ ROM drive , if I play off from it ( not on the v@@ cd : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as user root after adju@@ sting the device . it is absolutely certain to make sure / dev / c@@ drom to the CD@@ ROM drive shows .
X@@ ine starts only slowly , why do my CPU have to be tested for each time ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time is checked x@@ ine the CPU .

lat@@ ex ; : a professional text network application . under Unix @-@ like systems probably will be used on the package &amp; tex@@ as ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution can be used . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD can be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow a simple installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ; -@@ website .
this manual is available for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users are unlikely to read this manual . however , all suggestions are requested about documentation . if the support is requested for this project or documentation , contact via the k@@ ile ; web site should be made .
questions about or to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ ile ; on or requested enhanc@@ ements , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; ideal for use of all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ features in a graphical interface and within this simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs . furthermore , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his ways to learn the manual of Kate can be dressed . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start working directly with reading the chapter by &amp; Kate &apos;s reading .
for the lat@@ ex and lat@@ ex ; it is the right choice : L@@ ay @-@ T@@ ECH . there is difficult to use , also a La@@ ie ( English l@@ ay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros . a less sophisticated but more realistic experience is that it desc@@ ends from Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
where there is only a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to do . for example , H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã Â¼ r .
as well as other instruc@@ tors languages include &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction to which the gener@@ alized properties like paper format , side table and text field can be specified as well as a kitchen with the command \ \ &apos; { document } and must be closed again with the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
the quick @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a handy feature for the quick creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the document ( menu ) offers some options for the creation of the document . there are also some of the document related settings .
document classes : this will discuss the type of document document : article ( article ) , Book &#91; book &#93; , Cover &#91; Report &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Collection &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or Custom .
encoding : this is used the character encoding . it should be used to use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . in the best , UTF @-@ 8 should be used ( for correct processing of lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ packages for the lat@@ ex ; for the integration , they can only be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN @-@ regulations ) .
new users are not worried anymore . this is merely a brief description of the functions and more information about this will be given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - as well as other sources of source editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ matching ) . through &amp; k@@ ile ; it is easy to check out areas of a gr@@ assy text . however , it will be noticed by the modest appearance of the output file nevertheless , however , it will save you through the high@@ lighting time and the times .
with automatic translation of environments , when using a new command ( e.g. \ \ ) { command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates an empty line ( for entering the text ) and the appropriate line to connect the command ( e.g. \ \ \ &apos; command } ) . this function may be disabled in the menu settings ; setup ... La@@ Te@@ X commands can be disabled .
all documents are divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the most common and sub@@ du@@ ous element ) :
in the view of the document in the structural view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the setup .
when creating the own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be helpful very helpful . once a DVI ; file is created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer on the respective row in the lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format document and also other information such as the font , and also other information such as the font and is available next to PDF , to view , conversion and printing of DVI ; files for various systems and devices .
when using the cable search , the elements of the DVI ; file can be cli@@ cked onto a element in the DVI ; -@@ file , the exact opposite is the exact opposite of it . once upon a section in the lat@@ ex ; source code is made , it is inj@@ ected to the appropriate part in DVI ; -@@ viewer .
Master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . using a Master document , work is simplified using other integrated .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide Master document can be set up to project settings .
quick installation : the lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no error in the source code are displayed ) .
file over this mode : in this mode the DVI ; file on the so @-@ called &quot; well @-@ wi@@ red &quot; and there is no call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after fast @-@ construction .
in consideration of the editing tool@@ bar , the three gro@@ wers should be developed . the selection fields were developed for the quick setup of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... the adjustable &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selective field for further information is available for items such as : tags , fu@@ gues , notes and references . the options of the options are :
name : this command is created for a section , a picture or a different element .
connection : is used for reference to a fixed name ( choose a select box ) .
when using quote is displayed a select list with literary entries . at &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; files are required only if the file is necessary to use a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; written by hand .
the last radio box with the name of Gr@@ Ã Â¶ m will be used for the configuration of the font . it can be specified for the main text , the fu@@ gues notes etc . there are the following fon@@ ts for reference :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection options are available : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document art and proc@@ ession settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason .
the bra@@ ckets according to the \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . the code &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font size . the font is not set at the beginning , it can also happen in the text .
once the above source code has been entered , the lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way is to use the menu or the Kn@@ op@@ fs quick design .
the source code must be stored in front of the comp@@ ile . &amp; c@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , should be searched in the log@@ ging of errors . when using quick @-@ construction , the ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the log@@ ging should also be considered .
an environment ( English . environment ) is a text that is different when the remaining document is treated . for example , a report with the font size shall be created and only a few south exposure should have a different font size within the environment : \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ U@@ GH ) .
external factors are controlled only within the environment ( by \ \ ) { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there are no restrictions ( number ) for foreign exchange within a environment .
there are many possibilities for viewing the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , grease pressure , cur@@ sive printing , sub@@ st@@ ings , etc . , may end with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ &apos; { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and is long as long as possible until it will be closed with a \ \ end { empi@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be represented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } itali@@ c .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ &apos; { quota } and ends with \ \ end { quota } .
after the background to write the source code with the lat@@ ex ; sign language is presented , now a step @-@ for @-@ step instructions for the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
once in the wi@@ zard a bit text is entered , some adjust@@ ments for the document should be accomplished . to this , mind@@ . a quote , a few places in fat and cur@@ sive printing and a poem to use to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , an editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l e can be returned to the editor ( internal viewer ) . on an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI ; file has been printed , the document can be printed or printed into an &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun .
DVI ; is a remote file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi &apos;s Edition such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF Converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps as for the creation of the document can be printed ( see ) . by clicking on DVI , the document can be printed out using file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar illustrates the conversion of DVI ; file in other formats . once the DVI ; file from the lat@@ ex ; source code was created , the conversion can begin to put other formats using the P@@ FE in the tool bar .
the pre @-@ looking approach gives the direct jump from the editor to an additional position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ binary files . this only works Modern under Settings K@@ ile set up ... tools are going to be balanced .
to execute the pre@@ ten@@ se search , the mouse po@@ inter must be positioned in a row of the source code and cl@@ amped on preliminary search . the jump to the appropriate place in DVI ; -@@ viewer is then done so .
with this feature in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document of &amp; k@@ ile ; p@@ itted and to the respective line . this must be set &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set up as text editor ( setup ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if using a quick introduction of the &amp; DVI ; viewers are not able to use a mistake . if an error should be displayed , this will be displayed in the log@@ ging file or in the message window .
the log@@ ging file is added to the source source in the source code . in the editor , the loader file will always be used in the errors file . to view the faulty line , it must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log@@ ging and qu@@ ile ; jumps on the faulty line .
once you cli@@ cked on the relevant button in the tool bar , a window to the selection of the used template for the document is displayed :
when selecting empty document , a document can be written either from the ground or the assistant to the quick creation of a new document . more information is included in the section .
external user of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file size or file can be created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template via an existing document and selecting file template from document .
when creating a new document , a presentation through file New are replaced by some character strings by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in settings ... settings in general .
when creating the template &apos;s own template , it is necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string will be replaced by the input in document class . typically it will be used as : \ \ &apos; class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the assist@@ ants and that related entries in the editor . once the document has been created , the following steps has been accomplished :
when creating a new document , you can choose your own template instead of the standard plot .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created . will create a simple way to creating a template should be searched after one on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; kis@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be made directly out of the menu .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and to learn about his friends , the manual is to be drawn up to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; let &apos;s start working directly with reading the chapter by &amp; Kate &apos;s reading .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called for the use of La@@ Te@@ X @-@ reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; usage as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with the finished tr@@ l button to compens@@ ate the tex ; this means that in this way , clicking the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ) .
when pulling the text with penet@@ rated lin@@ ker mouse button , the balanced text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys , some parts of the source code can be balanced in the editing window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the capability to browse the various types of source texts and empha@@ size these . for example , the lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and mathematical form@@ ulas differ by another color .
many assist@@ ants like to look up your own jumps within the text . this spr@@ ing@@ stamp is empha@@ sized or the corresponding key stamp , so that it is also empha@@ sized at the first input of a character automatically .
the processor is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; though &amp; Kate ; already offers excellent opportunity to write in &amp; de@@ ile ; important functions for the letter of a lat@@ ex ; source code for their selection . under processor check , the following commands include text selection :
if a complete section ( group of lines containing on both sides contain a blank line ) . this extended meaning can not include a text with continuous lines , and lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only le@@ aning matter in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the drop is separated by two empty lines .
if the word is stored under the current cur@@ sor position . this command also has an extended meaning , as this command is also lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a ratio ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) mounted towards the end .
for example , a section of the document can be removed out of this first place . &amp; Kate ; offers the key code C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; kis@@ ile ; provides with own instruction for a faster application . under edit , the following commands include the text of the text :
remove a complete section . the definition for a sales in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of processing equipment .
it has already been clear that environments is a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders under Edit surroundings for an endless simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command is inj@@ ected at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly before the command to prepare the environment .
with this command is inj@@ ected at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly behind the command to close the surrounding area .
if the cur@@ sor is found before or within the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s ) is inj@@ ected to the end of the surrounding area ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many w@@ asted ambient commands can quickly be lost . this command conclude that the closing environment will not be disman@@ tled .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by bra@@ ckets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands , which correspond to the processing environment .
this command is inj@@ ected to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly before the fitting cl@@ amp .
this command is inj@@ ected to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly behind the welded closed bracket .
if the cur@@ sor lies before or behind the broken cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex , group # is inj@@ ected to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
in the entry of many w@@ asted groups bra@@ ckets can be lost quickly to the open view . this order closed the last group , so that the gro@@ unded structure of the &amp; tex ; groups are not divided .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple trials are used as G@@ Ã Â¼ r . for the purpose of purpose is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &apos; for two easy opening lines is used . also for the end of the beginning , the character is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two closing arguments for the lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic entry into the double touch sign can be set up under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X - and then exit .
there are also important settings ( e.g. wet or French ) and that in order to either be used German or French . there are also many other languages .
in the Dr@@ inking of Shift ; SI@@ G@@ AB@@ ET@@ AST@@ E stands for a smart line breaks . in the case the current position is located within a lists of environment ( e.g. line @-@ rate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , there is not only a line breaks , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
in a tables environment close to@@ w &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelli@@ gently enough to under@@ cut vo@@ ke &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be set up under settings ; setting up the La@@ Te@@ X .
some users know the columns into tables environments and all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . if this Tab@@ ulator is trying to be ex@@ iled in the displayed tab@@ ulator . although this tab@@ ulator is not the addition to the appropriate tab@@ ulator , in some space for the columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ators .
though &amp; Kate ; already offers good source code completion , it was extended in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to set special commands ( mostly for the lat@@ ex ; it is suitable for different modes ) . all these modes are suitable for automatic de@@ fle@@ ction . all these modes are set up under settings cal@@ ile ... adjustment .
at the beginning a new environment with the command \ \ &apos; { Sur@@ ro@@ undings } is &amp; c@@ ile ; automatically add the \ \ end { surrounding area } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the rack button , the last letter of typ@@ ing is removed and would be like to be a complete list . on the other hand , the list can also reduce the list by typ@@ ing a further letters also .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be found in a selection of a command . alternatively , jump to these positions by editing the N@@ Ã Â¼ st jumps is possible and the desired parameter then can be folded .
under settings cal@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; check out settings for these lists . there are various weather lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as visitors of the general language used to be selected .
the command mode is not required for the completion of environments . on the other hand , a few letters with \ \ &apos; will be entered and the call of the complete mode is often used . on the other hand , the environments are often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the completion of environments .
when calling the complete edit mode or the keyboard player Alt + Shift key space , the command will automatically be folded and it appears \ \ &apos; . afterwards , the ambient temperature can be continued in the easiest way and will stop by pressing the input button .
after this is accomplished , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recogni@@ zes that it is a lists of lists , even a first \ \ item command is named .
under settings cal@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; check settings for these lists . this mode uses the wake list of complete mode for &amp; tex ; - and lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; lists custom lists of ab@@ dic@@ ation , which will be replaced immediately by l@@ acked strings . the lists can be set up under settings . the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the code L is entered and the word edit mode is managed , or the title edit C@@ tr@@ l + Alt space bar , the letter L is replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X character chain .
large W@@ aters are not helpful for the automatic de@@ priv@@ ation . however , many whales were written in one document more than once . so , it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the completion for all of them is already written .
this mode can be set up in the menu Settings ... K@@ ile compar@@ ing down settings . here , the swelling can be set for the display of the completion .
the revision files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / of the par@@ l@@ ish home folder . mode is available for counter ( de@@ priv@@ ation ) , dictionary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the graphics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show the pattern of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and considered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for all kinds and re@@ direc@@ tives of pages . the PDF @-@ edition can be arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools newly arranged and then converted to ps@@ 2@@ pdf in a PDF file .
to order the result of work , you have to compiled the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the compilation of creating comp@@ iling , creating conversion and create views .
for the comp@@ iling of the source code for viewers like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion cannot be used with Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file and using Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
when using the instructions fast , a viewer is usually called upon the comp@@ ile . if no one @-@ installed viewer should be used , every time a new window will be opened every time .
a new project will be asked about the project &quot; New Project .... &quot; the following information is asked for the project :
for the fil@@ en@@ ame of the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows for application of EC@@ CLE@@ cript coding . scripts can be administr@@ ated in the vertical glue .
the API scripts are not yet developed yet , and can be found in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; yet .
first , first must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a systematic object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite clear system , in which the basic functions are expanded by a variety of diverse packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ as ; are supplied with many documents . this includes a documentation for the packages and another one lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference .
a complete Ref@@ ern@@ z for &amp; tex ; and its e@@ Ã¢ Â¬ c@@ un@@ de@@ Ã¢ s . this is not just about a description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) but rather is ideal for search for a specific form@@ att@@ ing . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; cr@@ ile ; in three key book@@ marks .
because of the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ as ; extra@@ di@@ ted , the finding of the right document is not always easy . as an active aid offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ as ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; supplied documents and for this page .
all documents are divided into categories and the great advantage is the search for packages name or whi@@ p . of &amp; k@@ ile ; only the results appear .

the plug @-@ in , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; yourself may have little to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not wait until somebody is used to work in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elem@@ ental @-@ elements can be found below .
to install a plug@@ in or a part , we start editing plug @-@ in . thus , the following dialog is opened :
this dialog enables all plug@@ ins to manage and add new plug@@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ ELE@@ MENT in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins is used without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path is searching for plug@@ ins .
often working on one project several persons in a sort of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports speci@@ fying team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickname is the user &apos;s nickname and serves to clear identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as Sub@@ project leader .
the user can search for yourself out of the list of team members who he is . this happens by pressing the team member of the list and expresses the button S@@ etze . currently , the currently selected Member ( your identity ) is bold , according to which you are : text .
nickname and the attitude of your own identity are important in terms of news and notes . see for further information on comments .
besides the overview of your team there is another advantage of the recording of the members of the team : it can be created an event to the team leader if something specific happens . see for further information .
event promotions are promotions that will be carried out if something specific in the project is done . an example would be the drawing of the opening and closing of the project , as much as someone worked , or the sending of a message if a file is saved , or a script that will play a file into the CV@@ S , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
at the event event configuration of the shift ; F@@ 7 Project project settings dialog . events can be edited , processed and deleted .
an email will be sent to the mailing list on selected address rates . the add@@ res@@ see may be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see in , as the ladder can be set up .
comments are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
please note : it can either select either the note message from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by note text .
notes can be sent to a defin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where the nickname of the team member , is a role in the project of the following possibilities : team leader Property Manager Sub@@ project leaders should be led to the enrich@@ ment or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below .
nickname and roll @-@ names are independent of large or small @-@ c@@ ens@@ l@@ ment , but spaces around the bra@@ ckets and methods : make the note inv@@ alid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ att@@ ing languages which is DT@@ D @-@ solid and web@@ based form@@ att@@ ing and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings are re@@ achable via the Settings menu . only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; specific settings are treated , a short description for others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by the Qu@@ ant@@ a Settings ... to be called . Th@@ er@@ dialog covers more than some pages that will be treated after each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; concerning tags , including a car , can be changed . the entries are :
large / small text from tags : large / small @-@ text from automatically added tags . normal large / small @-@ text means that tags will be inserted , as described in everyday XML files .
large / Small attributes of attributes : large / small @-@ text attributes of automatically added attributes . normal large / small @-@ text means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in everyday XML files .
optional tags : if checked , will be added to tags , for which the closing day is optional , immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
not optional tags : as above for all other tags , except for simple tags .
update @-@ Day automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic acc@@ ent of acc@@ ent signs : controls automatic transformation of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding encoding during enem@@ a .
M@@ IM@@ E types : facial types for identi@@ fying various types of files . using the standard , standard settings can be restored .
standard char@@ coding : encoding of newly created or in other ways than with file open @-@ open files ( where the coding of the file can be negotiated ) , but this setting is out@@ lined by the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is sent out by the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates regular backup copies , so that with a blackout or crash when the next start of the program can restore the document of this backup . this is not the same as the saving of the file . even for even stored documents a backup is created regularly , according to the set time .
the preview and the documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or a private view ( or the documentation in a box ) which makes it possible to look the documentation , preview and source code simultaneously .
put the window settings back to the default in the next start is useful if the user interface has come through shifting from M@@ DI @-@ Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views of each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command @-@ line parameters .
the warning messages area serves the control of the possibility to dis@@ able the display of war@@ nings by answering any more .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can change symbols instead of scripts instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ izing behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in shared mode . see the various modes , see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure @-@ tree , which represents the figure of the par@@ ser @-@ node in the document , can be stopped in detail .
in the mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking on the structural button with the mouse button@@ holes .
in the structural tree settings the visibility of knots can be opened automatically in the tree , the upgra@@ des of the tree to the editing and how deep in a change in structure tree is to be set . empty knots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are found , in which there are no item found in the current document .
the area for fixed abbrevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) , which can be un@@ folded in groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; DT@@ EP ; it means it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ cl@@ ause cut something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ as@@ cript .
here , the plug @-@ ins can be administr@@ ated . plug @-@ ins are part applications of third page , which can be used by any K@@ Part @-@ compatible application , most well @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following shall be stated :
address : the path to Plu@@ gin , if it is not located on a Stand@@ ar@@ place as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is given to the plug@@ in at the start , so it can open the current file to the file ( path of current file ) or the folder editor .
component in &quot; Just @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in is ref@@ using to store . only @-@ Read @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse to store when this option is not selected .
check the Plu@@ gin : is this enabled , then tested &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the given information is correct , even if the plug@@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bl@@ es@@ hooting was completely re@@ developed . support for the non @-@ necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in concept has been implemented , which enables various implement@@ ations on plug @-@ ins .
currently , only one plug@@ in is available , supporting &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; insert .
the use of de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a matching de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ ins in the project settings . using the button options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a project is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us interface ;
a view in which the content is displayed by monit@@ orable variables . appears usually in the left dock .
a view in which all the holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . appears usually in the bottom dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of de@@ bu@@ gger . appears usually in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , manufactured , or she shares the Plu@@ gin , when a project is opened , which is opened by default , so that this action doesn &apos;t have to be respected .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts the meeting . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , or end the leaf according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initi@@ ate a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . this request will be shown in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
points out the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script and to date information about the monitored variables and the current line . if this happens while the script is continued , the execution will continue . if it happens , the script will start with the requirement .
points out the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script , without information to secure variables and the current line number . if this is done while a script is passed , the execution will proceed as soon as a debit requirement is completed , the execution will begin once a requirement is made .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or includes .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger takes the next instruction in the script , where possible if possible in functions and includes set @-@ up .
points the Deb@@ ug@@ ger to move the instruction and go to the next way as if there was the current one .
opens a dialogue in which a variable or expression can be entered , the monitored value is supposed to appear in the vari@@ ance view .
with this dialogue , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale like this part of documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; front @-@ end and a part of x@@ sl@@ d@@ b@@ g that it can be found on htt@@ p : / / x@@ sl@@ d@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f@@ .net .
this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ets ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; capabilities like car rentals and scripts . their simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the record languages and family 2 , the script languages or CSS ; and tag@@ XML files containing the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are hand @-@ oriented , symbo@@ li@@ zed ly@@ ric@@ ots of picture buttons ( above the edit window ) , add text and instructions faster into a document as a user may vary .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see in for details for conversion .
this document describes how the XML files are to create , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ di@@ alog@@ es , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; itself . tool@@ bars allow a quick paste of tags in a document without risk of a typ@@ ew@@ rit@@ er .
tag folders are nothing as a folder . they only contain the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the recording language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the day XML , and declared whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is wise to use as many as possible , so that other users have a better view and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits will be presented in simple ways .
this is the root element of a day XML document . it can only be found in one document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it contains only a mere item type about himself otherwise .
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( Family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 )
only valid for the Type Method . speci@@ fies the name of the class , where this method belongs . ( Family 2 )
yes , the day has a common attribute and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
set a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; Tag identi@@ fies that &apos;s a mere @-@ element type element .
describes a attribute of a tags . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it contains further tags that will describe as this attribute is to be shown &amp; etc ; This is a only element @-@ type element .
the source code for the attributes used in the tag editor dialog , and the attribute tree to be used
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used for reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p methodology within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and one method name . the arguments drawn to the method . may be empty or % day name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container day that forms the elements of a list together . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an element @-@ element item .
speci@@ fies the attribute texts of a tags within a dialogue . this tag may occur only once in a dialogue only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ Tag ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and the size of a field in dialogue . this day should be available for each field in dialogue once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defin@@ ing tags . this element is a mere @-@ element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is a mere @-@ element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 , = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly en@@ ched and closed .
spaces do not affect anything , but watch out &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; can be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to review the XML files , the tools dialog can start up in the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us window , and select Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . select another dialog to follow the simple instructions to follow .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , check only for loading of the tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
in the following an example of a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; -@@ ELE@@ MENT from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the file name for this day XML file will be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 day XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE services &gt; &amp; lt ; p = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor that can be used via DT@@ D edit DT@@ D settings . with editing a &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; should be created with a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Res@@ cue 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D mode . ( / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) nickname = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as Nick@@ name .
a action can be set with settings defined actions ... click on New Action leads to the same dialog :
this action is allocated to this action . by clicking the User button , a key short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ one is the current key short@@ cut .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the detailed settings and inserted in execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications can be started ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that will change the document , or as input ( or parts of document ) , even the Schnell@@ start dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EPs .
first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be indicated . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ ini@@ a / scripts in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable you can use in command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file is removed : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with P@@ ID of running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the external script is used .
parameters for this event , normally the file name of the current document or the path to project file .
in addition to the enum@@ er@@ ated methods , a script can receive from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the input field , the input can be determined , which can be sent to standard input . possibilities are :
selected text : the select section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be diver@@ ted . there are two types of issue : normal edition , written on the default issue ; error messages , which should be done by default text , by default , the value is set to issue :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . in the given case , it is not too many , therefore one can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
once a tool@@ bar has been added , you need to add actions and configure . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all necessary fields and add them to the matching tool bar .
complete everything and if the day attributes has and you are planning to re@@ activate dialog &quot; Day , &quot; if available , so that a input using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly symbol . who should remember the action with this icon ? will we replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ icon@@ edit ; select from the &amp; k@@ menu ; graphics Other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; coffee edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
with regard to that the day start , is , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as los , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user is sign@@ posted ; click on this symbol to insert ; - tag in current document .
after creating the symbol it must be connected to the action . this is done beyond the menu with settings defined actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text box there is a button , press it .
select the folder , in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue along with other tags , so it still exists , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions for tool bar add or it should be shared for better overview by some separ@@ ators into multiple groups . open the tool@@ bars and set up dialogue on settings tool@@ bars . make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to select the Tren@@ ner ( very left above ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element , which should be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to tool@@ bar .
for example , I want a fast possibility to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note , as the separ@@ ator support the group@@ ings . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar will believe that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by setting all symbols , to ensure that everything works .
secure in the correct folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the correct folder . please custom@@ ize your &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool bar will be loaded ( s ) if a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation to the script language or the form@@ att@@ ing language that you like to like . therefore , this chapter , how I create a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory if anyone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create a existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ er@@ ics / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . first , let us handle the second part we treat here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , for example , ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these document@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Documentary Section 1 = No. 1.@@ html , 2 = Socialist 2.@@ html @-@ 1 = tag@@ .@@ html @-@ 2 = daily 2.@@ html @-@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html @-@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the document tree . for example , you can see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such a thing :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP User Table of Cont@@ ents = Inclu@@ x@@ .@@ html G@@ etting Start@@ ed = Introduction , ... Introduction = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = long @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . that shows that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the chess tel@@ ev@@ isions ( except through the reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out .
note that the contents may be refer@@ enced directly on a file ( and consequently , at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; file is displayed ! ) .
spaces do nothing , but watch out &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; - based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ eries are replaced .
the section section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is intended for the gest@@ ure of context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ array function would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ am@@ List ) and file binding .
a simple list of balanced context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily store your file do@@ cr@@ c / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / share / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc / doc / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc / doc / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc / doc / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc / doc / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / share / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / share / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / share / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / share / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / share / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / share / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / share / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / share / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / share / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / share / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / share / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / share / qu@@ ant@@ a
if you are sure that these are well and worth being shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud of being involved in the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to divide the separ@@ ating resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool bar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or anything else . at different places there is an email sending menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in context menu of files and folders in templates and in scrip@@ ting tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download and only be made available when our team needs them as correct and used for the release . to make a useful contribution , we recommend the source of resources guaranteed , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is required for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event that you have several keys to pass through the input fields . ( URL preview can remain empty ) and then click OK .
upload from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) menus , upload tool@@ bars , and can also be started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , yet before the installation , exam@@ ines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the case of problems , it and it can then be broken . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed , a message appears with the speci@@ alization of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it can be supported but time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files can be needed in everyday XML format . there is the easiest way to convert a DT@@ D automatically into a DT@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and Conver@@ ting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with DT@@ D description that should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
objective name : newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defin@@ i@@ tive line : the string that will appear in the DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
the conversion of the DT@@ EP after conversion : if enabled , release &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this opportunity .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . to understand these and full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this chapter tries to get involved with these fundamental concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to bring little benefits to them .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work area has divided into three areas : global , locally and projects . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is available in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administr@@ ators to secure actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements provide a personal collection of web development agent for a single user . these are user specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . it can be everything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns until tool @-@ like with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply said that this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , making the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ window , the Bau@@ man@@ ners , the Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ ites with information and tool@@ bars . please beat in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click on how to get a context menu with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document , such as close the current , other or all the boxes , jump or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S command to the current document .
right click in the Edi@@ tor@@ Area Guide to another context menu , how basic editing steps ( cut / copy / insert ) , editing under the mouse pointing device or open the file , if the string is called by the mouse pointing one file .
at the top end of the Edi@@ tor@@ f@@ enst@@ ers there are the tool@@ bar of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional is shown , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of tool@@ bar . in the course of further expansion of tool@@ bar , the tool@@ bar will be adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert ; in their document , then click the icon representing the tag . now , you can insert the data for this just one @-@ fed tag . if you want to insert the data for this straight day ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a different fields in dialogue .
the construction outlook ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open and pass through . in the presentation with cart@@ ei@@ re@@ ites are available for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project using right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or delete the files from the storage medium can be carried out in the context menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , whole web site &amp; etc . all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what context they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the appropriate users and templates in projects are usable only in the project .
here you will find information about the available scripts . the concept of the structure in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retri@@ eve the information available to a script . via the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script , to edit or send with email .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by links to the element it will set the cur@@ sor in the document on the position of the element . by right click of an element it opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and re@@ trac@@ ing of the building .
this tree appears among other building views . with it , man@@ quickly can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ e@@ ders . based on the content , the amend@@ ment of all available attributes with a few mouse cli@@ cks .
here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development . you can download a pack@@ et documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder to a project can be edited project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two boxes at the lower end of the window , can be accessed using the beneficial information : the window window and the problem window .
this cart@@ on display shows information on each in Qu@@ ant@@ a &apos;s running script , e.g. the current DT@@ D of the current document and all modifications to DT@@ D .
this cart@@ on display shows all errors in the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate @-@ side of the tool is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar with email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can ass@@ ure them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , like any other backup and load !
it &apos;s reasonable if you want to adapt the place of the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf might have a number of options to get to the configure script . in order to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems at boot &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H is in front of her bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimised for a rapid Web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
during an effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; Editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , ext@@ end@@ able aw@@ up languages would be ? well , this would make him an absolutely treas@@ ured web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done .
no longer to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; therefore the suitable &amp; IDE .
well , to the above claim must be noted that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; designed , in good use of free software , the idea of why somebody else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ sc@@ aff@@ old is not only all possible but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; so to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web development to ampli@@ fy the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . through self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars the automation is possible almost every task . by the program Kom@@ eu@@ calyp@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; extend without any scrip@@ ting language of scripts . ( more about it is found in . )
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for a fast web development and has quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; Plus is associated with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; the original developer left the GP@@ L lic@@ enced version and produced a commercial program .
more in the detailed documentation is with help : / qu@@ ant@@ a ( either this URL in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / qu@@ ant@@ a run ) .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ a is currently developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list does not change each time if you open a file which is not located , whereby the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for the later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pre @-@ list file , only one error will be reported .
conver@@ ts from the cli@@ p@@ board there contained special characters to &amp; HTML ; l@@ ens@@ ation , so that it displays correctly and do not understand from the browser as form@@ att@@ ing instructions .
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; copy , which is the correct way for inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
switches the recorder and off . it allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; button .
go directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are out !
search for a string of string or regular expression in selected directory . a type gre@@ p or used with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . that &apos;s the window , in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
ej@@ ector switches at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the main reporter is activated when you are changing to the structure tree .
displays the icons @-@ old left from the main window . this column allows you to set a book@@ mark with a mouse click .
if there is a book@@ mark in the current file , they will appear in the menu with entries from previous or nearest , depending on the position of cur@@ sors in the document .
book@@ mark from other open documents appear in the menu named after the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are saved with the .@@ web@@ pr@@ j file extension .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or a sub@@ folder and add it to the project .
invites the files to your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and if you have downloaded any input / output modules ( Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you will find the details below .
downloads a project tool bar . these are kept in project you / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu , if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
opens up a dialogue to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved through at@@ titudes actions . tool@@ bars will be saved through tool @-@ like tool@@ bars or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bar .
remove a tool@@ bar from the visible area . this does not extingu@@ ish them from hard drive . if you don &apos;t have the tool@@ bar yet , you will be asked if you want to do that .
so you can send her own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team , that the tool bar is present in the next release ) . the menu entry opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars on the main server , where everyone can access it . see in .
download one &amp; DT@@ D ; you or any one has done and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
download / auff@@ ric of the ti@@ ti@@ ties out of the &amp; DT@@ D ; is useful if the entities from the &amp; DT@@ EP ; if this global is not present and a write permission in the global K@@ DE file is not present , it fails to store the loading .
this menu contains a list of tags that are available in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day installation dialog , if there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; specific sub@@ menus .
activated or de@@ activated the intelligent entry of tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent entry means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , that ref@@ uses to paste through tool@@ bar if this day contra@@ dic@@ ts the rules to this place .
in the plug@@ ins menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the menu points . click it . clicking a activated plug @-@ ins disabled .
elec@@ ts the tax@@ pay@@ load mode for the current file . the list of available schem@@ atics depends on the world ; -@@ version .
select the type of line identification . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms for developing . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by the external use Ti@@ dy .
immediate change between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , changing times may need or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the card card mode , which is also the default mode , or the window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu includes an entry for each open window . with a selection of a contract , the corresponding under@@ window will be activated .
displays the display of the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main f@@ ew@@ rit@@ ers .
the changes in this dialogue makes every application that use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
direc@@ ts the behaviour of the Edi@@ tor@@ ped@@ o . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you can find details .
a dialog appears , in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar , or add which to change sequences .
this should create an aid in the context of the mouse pointing , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and lic@@ enced , but as with every open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; they will find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled in the top right down , as for example , after filling the project called the entire directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties .
here &apos;s the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name file , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces using the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine to which one wants to access , one , except for local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ examples ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
lets you use this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol is used . depending on the setup of the remote computer could be necessary to be necessary .
this is the folder in which the Templ@@ ates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default template . if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bar is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set instead of the standard .
it allows to add files from local file system to the project . you can select several files or folders .
this setting is great if you have static we@@ bin@@ ds that you want to download and change . if you want to change and change the scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
def@@ aul@@ ts , if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , are supposed to be inserted . if a project is started from the foundation not to ha@@ ken .
with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make an accurate selection of cou@@ pons .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by clicking or , by removing the ham@@ let , cl@@ aps out of the project .
the last screen of the new project assist@@ ants contains three settings that can simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can instantly upload or instantly upload the project properties tab in the menu window , or with the keyboard Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholder possible ) , which are re @-@ compiled for project @-@ related operations such as project folder .
comple@@ mentary option to top , even files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded at the opening of the project . can be read more about project views .
this allows you to choose the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plu@@ gin can be set with the Op@@ tions button . in this case , the bug hunting is described .
in the sub@@ window profiles , high loading profiles ( see in ) can be adjusted , as well as the display of a building view for the content of the server for each profile , by pointing one own tree view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details .
in the event configuration you can switch event promotions and add these actions , change or delete action . event actions are executed if a specific event takes place , such as the backing of a file . see details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . this behavior is currently not able to influence .
to open another project , select Project ... from the menu project or the symbol project opening from the tool@@ bar . the dialog Project is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; be closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , changed files . same happens when you load a new project .
project supervision gives free access to the project in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , however , the entries are open and open ... in conjunction with the right mouse button@@ ing menu :
here , different profiles can be chosen . the profile contains information on the site of uploaded files . see .
allows removing of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will be blind@@ ed to prevent removing the removal .
the password will keep in the core memory and forget about programming . this possibility is useful if common up@@ loading of files is necessary , and the rather un@@ safe password in the record option does not come to question .
this will stop the transmission or just leave the dialog if you have to change your opinion before the upload .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many high @-@ loading profiles can be uploaded , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) are uploaded to various servers . when editing or creating a profile this dialogue is displayed :
this is the name of the server to be copied to files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and installed the installed Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and NFS .
port for transfer . normally this must not be changed , except the network administrator operates a service not at the usual port .
depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a risk . use it to your discretion . the password is stored on the plate so it cannot be read , but everyone with programm@@ ers can easily see in clear text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simply exchange of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored or deleted in the project , or the project tool@@ bar , re@@ achable via setting tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in its own mode of operation .
as already mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best about the menu of tool@@ bars . use and adding . adding tool bar will be treated below in the section Add of tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either by context menu ( right click on the tool bar ) , in which with new action , remove new tool@@ bars or tool@@ bars , what can be stated in the dialog , where the actions can be displayed on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , in addition , the entries are removed and action worked , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up actions in the menu with settings tool@@ bars ... and setting up actions .. .
templates are in the essential document skel@@ eton , code cuts and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any other existing file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any other existing directory included in the storage room . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you propose to the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template .
binary is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be inserted any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc ; binary designs are inserted in documents using links ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available in the storage room under global templates .
documents can be printed from any text document . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally a simple sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding for the purpose and organis@@ es work in a special way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates . see in for more information to the templates .
this kind templates is useful if not a new document is inserted based on a template but the same text area always in the documents . you can find everything from a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ as@@ cript or Perl based . some examples are available in the storage room under global templates . see in for more information to the templates .
as the name says , these templates serve all websites as templates . you are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder hier@@ archy , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
design a document structure according to exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and choose file As template storing as local template ....
once this happens , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the storage room under the project engineering .
select text in your document and click on the File Report as a template of local / project template . alternatively , the choice is easily drawn with pulling and disman@@ t@@ ling on the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file is only enough to copy in a pre @-@ level file . all file management functions can be used , such as pulling and disman@@ tle or inser@@ ting over the file @-@ tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select in the file tree or in the project files building view on a folder on the right and secure site template . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as local or global template .
project templates allow a very effective pre @-@ oriented incident . you can create head@@ line and foot@@ er @-@ line or dynam@@ ically . to create files or link with them . additionally , you can keep certain things in the eye using templates in projects .
the basic structure in the sub@@ window templates are based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / share / qu@@ ant@@ a / template and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / templates . each of these folders is equivalent to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to determine the behavior of a folder , click the folder with the right mouse button to select and select the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a select box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blind@@ ed , as soon as eleven attributes is blind@@ ed .
this is enabled by default . if a regular folder was set to de@@ activate it in this path , it would seem explicitly enabled in this path , unless they appear to appear in a normal folder . if nothing appears , it is likely to be found in a regular folder .
allows you to be displayed or re @-@ issued text for templates in this folder . this could be general header or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows copying of contents into a folder with special head@@ line / foot@@ er a whole presentation already with the suitable head@@ line / foot@@ er lines .
in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing to , right mouse button ) above a complete instructions for adding @-@ folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; source editor that can be reached via menu view . the first mode replaces the source editor through the V@@ PL ; Editor and the second divi@@ des the editing window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; Editor .
the V@@ PL Editor functions as follows : it invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and an cur@@ sor will appear . then you can edit and reset to the source code editor , in which the amend@@ ments are displayed in the V@@ PL file .
when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; file editing . to edit &amp; PHP ; there is no plans to change this behaviour .
the second mode works exactly like the first one , except that at the same time , changes both in the source editor and V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor synchron@@ ously are activated , this mode is already active , transferred the key printing the active cur@@ sor from a window to another , where the position is preserved in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source editor can be set adjustable via settings Qu@@ ant@@ a .... It can be automatically set between synchron@@ isation after a click or automatically . in addition , the recommendation can be set automatically . in principle , the recommendation can be set for fast calcul@@ ator and a great span for slow calcul@@ ator .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so it is possible to choose the title of the web page . this is also called the document properties tab at work with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor , this is used to reduce the binding tissue . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a @-@ tags allow the storage of information on the document itself e.g. bu@@ zz@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pushing the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list allows the change of the inhal@@ ed , such as keywords on the column name and keyword key wor@@ d@@ 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the presentation of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete . a change over the list is possible just as with the met@@ a @-@ elements . the edit of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to bind an external CSS style template by pressing the file button and select the appropriate file .
the cur@@ sor is like in a word processor , due to moving with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor will behave like usual . the markings works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and can be deleted by button or removal code .
the inser@@ tion of tags will be done in the same way via tool@@ bar , as in the source editor . it is to note that the inser@@ tion of tags are previously inserted an existing identical tags , if an anchor @-@ tag , is enclosed with text , every other surrounding anchor must be removed .
some tools like the tables @-@ assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; work in this release must be used tables or lists of tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ d@@ b@@ g ; a tool for analysis of style deposits . in contrast to other programs for sty@@ le@@ vies , the search for certain elements can be possible and the execution of the style can be followed .

there are many graphics tools to compare . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated , because one of the contributions had changed a lot of changes , and at the same time it had changed a lot of changes . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts with mer@@ ging .
this program used to me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within this lines . and there was no clu@@ es on the places where perhaps only the decline had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could result differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , any quantity of additional useful functions were added .
if you want to compare quickly text , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the compar@@ ative window .
a function that made much work was the compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function transformed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful if two persons are working independently of each other one piece of co@@ de and changes the original file . in this editor you can even edit the result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can download the result directly . the screenshot shows three qu@@ ell files to merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you with the same and mer@@ ging complete folder . this screen picture shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when folder :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and also include the capabilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you have frequently check co@@ de , you will like this feature .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble more if no one changes the integration . )
if one file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means both files differ .
if all files are in the same name , but in different folders , you can use the Ti@@ p@@ per@@ work by creating only the file names in the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder
opening dialog allows manual entry of file names , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or select an last open file from the folding list . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file . if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences are performed with two files .
on the kno@@ b folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the compar@@ isons or merge of folders will be selected , for B and C , but a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
when connecting , the input field is active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily necessary to determine an output file immediately . you can also do this step later .
the button button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting with the compar@@ ing / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare the whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active compar@@ ative window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog , you do not need to select files easily with the break button .
you can also use pulling and disman@@ tle : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall in a comparison window .
what thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would have to compare two corresponding files to it in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and then compare the relevant sections , and then compare it .
note : there is currently nothing out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; out . only the text box is supported in a comparison window .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the pulling and disman@@ tle the text into another program as output and insert ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text box there is the Info line . the information line of the source window contains the character A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that windows C is optional ) . ( if the path comes to a file , let the mouse take a while over the row . then a small charity window will display the full name . )
the three sources of the source are the letters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is recognized , one can differenti@@ ate on the color which file differs . if both files differ , the colour scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) good to see .
links to the text is the summary column . when differences were found , the column displays the appropriate color . with some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , B. are white characters only in string strings and comments , for pre@@ processor and in a few , rare cases relevant . )
the vertical line , divi@@ ding the merge column , is interrupted at the digits , where the respective source file has no lines . if the line of line is activated , the line is shown in broken lines .
the results window ( among the compar@@ isons ) also has a personal Info line with the inscription : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; and change &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , the store is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to nÃ¤ch@@ tigen / un@@ resolved conflict to find the still remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons can be used , each difference is also necessary to solve the problem of manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the first row of the group is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this is also a jump from the position in the windows , where the beginning of the group is not visible . ) This group is lifted up with the color background colour for current area and on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes it will be left out by automatic merge or by manual editing any further line more in the group ; but this is only a plac@@ eholder for the event that you can change your opinion , and perhaps again another source . this text appears neither in the final stored file , nor in a selection you might want to copy and insert something different .
the text &amp; lt ; summar@@ ized ; however , it appears in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy the text from the results window . be careful with this function .
note : if the sources select the options , ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
navigate mainly with the image sequence and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are using in one of the window , you can also use the arrow keys at the beginning , beginning , end , tr@@ l @-@ beginning and C@@ tr@@ l @-@ end , si@@ w how you can also use it from other programs . click here to Navig@@ ate navigate .
in the eye window , you can also use the other keys to edit . using the insert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ clock mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows onto the beginning of the respective group ( as stated in the section and the edi@@ table expl@@ or@@ isation window was explained ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upwards / Str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ ward ) or to the next / former conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / Str@@ g @-@ picture ) or to the next / former conflict . therefore , there must be differenti@@ ated between deleted and un@@ resolved conflicts .
to copy the mar@@ ker in the cli@@ p@@ board , you &apos;ll need to automatically copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ insert ) . if this is enabled , whatever you mark , automatically fall@@ back into the cli@@ p@@ board . be careful with this option , because you could acci@@ dentally write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
line end are stored according to the initial operating system \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0 .
the options and the list of the last files used will be automatically stored and restored with the next start . ( menu entry &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
select a script by fixed width . ( on some systems , dialog can also use more variable width on a selection , you should not use this . )
when you activate this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c script . if the chosen scrip@@ ture doesn &apos;t support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form but would be rendered . on these systems , the button pre@@ ferences automatically displays an odd colour .
when this option is enabled , the tab@@ ulator button will be inserted into the appropriate number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator character will be inserted .
if you push the input or return , the default line will be automatically used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy into the cli@@ p@@ board is cancelled then .
you can select which tick @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
when compar@@ ing files try &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all fully identical lines in the source files can be ignored . only during this first step you can ignore white characters . the second step compar@@ es white characters . in this step , white characters will not ignore .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a car type &apos; \ \ &apos; and a line slot &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , but then you could only store files with different sizes at the side @-@ to @-@ side comparison , however , if this option is activated , a white character will be handled . during the merge this option must be disabled . in default , this option is disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis you will ignore numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; -@@ &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) . in the result the differences are still shown , but they are treated like white signs .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
intensive to smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in automation mode , this attitude will determine how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next Hungarian conflict will continue .
sol@@ ves automatic all conflicts in white characters by selecting the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection ) . if you need this only of time to time , use better the functions of voters in numbers or comments , if the options are to ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments .
these options will be treated in chapters to scan and execute mer@@ ging . look for details under documentation for directory compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version is done by the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original version , if already a such backup file is done with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original , this will be removed without further backup .
fits the language of user interface . changing this option does not change the current running program . you need to end and restart the current program . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set up globally across the control centre . )
the following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry . if you activate this option , it will be used for all entries the top setting .
about the selection process for encoding appears a short notice of what is local encoding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a informal character here . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences such as special characters treated and interpre@@ t . since encoding for each file is individually adjustable , files can be compared and merged with different encoding .
if you have edited one file , you can specify which encoding will be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing command , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. , your files can handle 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the process command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII files ) .
turn this off to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting changes in white characters in the text or over@@ sight . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options are activated or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences may see between two of three files . by selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal still a second excess column with the required information .
sometimes you would prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . see the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
orders the same window next to each other or over@@ lap . this can also be useful to ads from long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and decide so suddenly , when you compare only two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as pre @-@ set name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , the name of the last used output file is maintained . )
in reading one file it will first pass this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor , which is precisely your requirements . for example , you can use this function , for example , to remove interference .
in reading one file it will first pass this external command first . if a standard pre @-@ processing command is passed . if you write a normal pre @-@ processing command , you can only write your own pre@@ processor , which matches exactly your requirements . each input line must have a related issue line .
the thought behind it is to allow users to enable more flexibility when choosing the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users want to program this . however , the good news is , however , that in most cases , sed or per@@ l completely sufficient .
type \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1 .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key words to paste the generated character strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while experiment@@ ing with sed experiment , you may begin to understand it and perhaps like this regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar stuff .
the ignor@@ ing numbers of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further processing command for zig@@ gur@@ . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a key , and each hits will be replaced by nothing , so quasi deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several encour@@ ages at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the needs of each other . example :
instead of sed , you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; allergies are different from per@@ l some details different . where used \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s ) needed .
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for viewing and interaction . the further operations change only data , which sees the line @-@ off @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off @-@ pre@@ processor look the output of normal pre@@ processor .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences , you may not notice certain differences in acci@@ dental and worst important data .
often programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge using &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders .
... makes a proposal for every object ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the merge and displays the sim@@ ulated changes without it really carry out ,
... carry out selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the compar@@ ing and merge of individual files . you only need to specify a file on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are assembled , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target is specified , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start to merge the merge . to select the merge , select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow )
during the folder , you will inform you a small news window about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files are listed , which have been compared until then .
when scanning the folder is complete , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 shows the window with the results on the left , ...
any file and any folder was found during the scan , displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mou@@ sec@@ lick .
the folder structure is normally folded , by clicking on the + / - click on the object or by clicking on the object / click on the left / right . the directory menu includes two functions of all sub@@ directories and open all sub@@ directories , with which you can open all folders .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the column Name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folder , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane on the selected object . in such a case , the merge operation can not automatically be selected . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as shown in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in columns A / B / C .
in identical entries , the color is identical , even when the age of entries is different .
folders will be identical as the same as their whole content is identical . then , folders is the same color . in folders , the age is in@@ significant for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a sheet again , which is only green , then yellow will be and later , when it is old , red is red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy from B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. , if a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types exist . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. , if a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types exist . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the synchron@@ ize mode is active , if only two folders and no explic@@ it targets are provided , and if the option is synchron@@ ize , then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that afterwards both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical are : merge and the result in both folders . ( the user watches as visible file names for output file only B ; copied directly after the merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders will be merged , and select the newer file instead of merge ( un@@ safe ) , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggests a error message : files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such mistakes can not be fixed , the merge cannot be started .
during the merge , one file is working according to the other . it shows the status column being successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected was done . if the merge is complete , you should check out a final review and see if the status is all right .
if in the setup dialog , the file compar@@ ative analysis is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will show more columns . these contain the number of inv@@ inci@@ ble , dissolved , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts is only shown if three files are compared or merged . )
you can either merge either the selected entry ( file or mer@@ cen@@ aries ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can initi@@ ate the merge .
please note : if you have no target user , then it will be used in the Three @-@ file merge mode C as a target , when using two @-@ file merge , B is chosen as a target and used to synchron@@ ize A and / or B as a target .
if you select a target user , please check if all entries must be displayed in the objective folder , even in folder structure . there are some options to be ski@@ pped in the certain entries . check out these options to avoid un@@ lov@@ able surprises :
to summar@@ ize all entries : select directories and continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) . in order to bring only the current item : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if by conflic@@ ting file types still exist inv@@ alid merge actions , a message appears on the defective elements . you can then select a valid action .
when you merge all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options , sim@@ ulate and ab@@ ort .
choose Sim@@ ulations if you want to see what would happen without the really changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( see the screenshot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select another directory together / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you still haven &apos;t saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work continues with the next story .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you can re@@ lie@@ ve some error messages that will help you to ski@@ p the cause of the problem . thus , you have the opportunity to select another action for the entry or solve the problem , before you proceed with the interaction .
if some entries have been merged individually , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , these entries ( in the current session ) and performs it later in later , these entries are taken or not stored again . only if you change the merge action , these entries are re@@ group@@ ed again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) has now a section called Directory @-@ merge with these options :
only files that match the specified patterns are shown in the element tree . separ@@ ating the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ one ; a valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not comply with this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern , are not shown in the element tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern , are not shown in the element tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
ignore files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ os@@ matic files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be specified with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , you have a hiding place attribute . in other file systems , a previous score marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the Element@@ um or not . this option is switched ON in default .
links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic link will be compared . if the option is switched on , the files will be compared to the links . this is de@@ activated in default .
when the option is switched off , the links below are switched on . if the option is switched on , the links are treated as normal folders . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible recur@@ sions . a link to itself would lead to a final loop and run &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crash@@ es . ) This option is switched off in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and shows the statistics columns . ( the number of rede@@ emed , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower if they are applied to files that do not contain any text . ( specify an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large files across a slow network , it may be faster , only the chan@@ ges@@ tion and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain measure of security . please use caution . this option is g@@ un@@ ed at default .
similar to Confi@@ denti@@ tion date . there is no real comparison rather than it is identical . this may be useful when copying the chan@@ ges@@ tion date . please use caution . please use caution . this option is g@@ un@@ ed at default .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ize mode , if two files are compared and no target folder was indicated . in this mode the proposals are identical to merge . the results of merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences instead , the copy of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this will be considered un@@ safe , because it will not change the knowledge that the other file is not even modified . ) This option is switched off in default .
if a file or folder will be replaced by another folder or delete the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file is deleted with the .@@ original extension already exists , this will also be deleted without further backup . this also applies the normal merge of single files , not only the merge complete folder . this option is switched ON in default .
normally , the folder mer@@ ging view is visible in the merge of single files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want this , you can turn the window into the window menu and switch the change between directory &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file via double @-@ click . however , in the directory menu , you can also use a single file directly . if you store the result , the status will be done directly , and the file will not be fed again if you run the folder .
but this status is lost , however , if you need to read the directory : directory menu : new
K@@ DE supports network transparency with help from Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders , which are located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local file .
a URL has other syntax as local files and folders . a few things should be observed :
a path may be relatively expensive or .. contain . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) for example , has a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes , due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol . it follows a brief list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link will be on a file or folder . then a file will always be accepted as a link goal . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no option to edit per@@ missions or change of change . hence , the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( please refer to the confidenti@@ ality option . ) ( This is only possible at local files . )
the main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts to start the built @-@ in differences . in order to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part show from the context menu .
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files , if it is used as a substitute , take &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . then it will start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program starts to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu look inside - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since creating the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merge or compar@@ isons is not supported in part mode .
there are already tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s Kom@@ pare ) already . also , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 indicates that it can merge like the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs very long and have learned a lot by using other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone this way or get it so .
you have probably compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure script for the configure script in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can not find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only one non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not as identical . i@@ F similar lines : next to Each other , this du@@ is , but this is more often the case .
the editor is noticeable for any difference in the files where he starts and where he finishes . this is necessary to simply remove a conflict through the click into the source text and select button A / B / C . however , this important information is easily stored as text file , and it is too much effort to design an additional file format that could save this information .
the effort for this was so far too big . you can recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit larger quantities on text , another editor should be used .
after removing text , no sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot delete . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; many colors used to create lower differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use an editor for this .
many good ideas and error reports come from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or newer .
for information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage .
a list of the last changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file in the Qu@@ ell package .
around &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder installed in your system , installed in the K@@ DE . if you are uns@@ afe , you will find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ aker are used , you shouldn &apos;t have any problems with comp@@ iling . nevertheless , trouble occurs , please report on the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) in the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current marking .
only differences : files are identical in all folders are not in folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current version version you will need to upgrade to these options to the folder with the function Ref@@ res@@ h . )
there are only entries to show the differences that are not included in the target file . if the target of these files do not already contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( behavior will be cancelled later in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons to choose from the source with the certificate A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are installed on one of the buttons , lines are attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed in the button .
by default , this option is disabled . the differences in different characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature preview of all virtual work areas . it is quite practical to view the ongoing programs on the work@@ spaces , to change its size to end them or post@@ p@@ one . this works both within a desktop or even at several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can view all virtual work areas as well as applications . applications can be selected and even be moved on desktop and other applications .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible in both desktop and other areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only been cli@@ cked on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; but if there is also the symbol and the name of the application and the entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and view .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when it was cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is marked , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , with the middle mouse button in mind and also to other work@@ spaces .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual work areas are displayed .
cross this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager to display the numbers of virtual working surfaces . it is shown together with name indicate , the names are provided with ordin@@ ate numbers , eg ; 1 . mind .
if this field is crossed , the background every desktop is displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . otherwise , only the empty work@@ spaces are displayed in order to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its standard symbol and pixel . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very quick systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be determined : traditionally lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in some other windows managers appear in some other windows ; horizontal and vertical in a vertical range , which is very good for viewing side@@ ways in mind .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager miniature program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , displaying the windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right click the right button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and followed by switching the switch ... allows the dialog to appear .
currently , this can not be changed in the dialog Settings ... but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t need a write permission for the file , you must register as user root or apply to your system administrator . in this file you need to sign the wind@@ ow@@ al mode and point to that value . possible values are :
da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package k@@ de@@ base is , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ mag ; one part of the screen . this application is interesting for different users . this application includes artists , web designers and people with a vision . this documentation is to be a complete manual for use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag , is a very powerful application that is constantly expanding to new features . it is optimised for use on high @-@ performance machines .
when you &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as above . the main window of screen is displayed . in the following , this window is displayed as a magni@@ fying window . in the following , this window is displayed as a magni@@ fying window , is an enlarged range of screens and is described in the following as a select window .
in the default setting increases &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse pointing device as an mov@@ able micro@@ scope . alternatively , you can use &amp; k@@ mag , to display a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( eg . selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse pointing at the screen ( eg ; on the left ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse pointing to the enlarged window , select the mouse pointing out . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to detect the form of the mouse pointing device . this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; mouse pointing .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can custom@@ ize the box window to your needs . you can change it with the arrows and mas@@ ons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse pointing to the magni@@ fying window , and hold the left mouse button , so you can gr@@ ate the contents of the enlarged scale , and move it with the arrows keys .
in addition , if you need to press the &amp; Shift ; button , press the &amp; M@@ MB ; use the select window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the drop window . note that the top left corner of the radio station is fixed and only move the lower right corner .
&amp; k@@ mag ; possesses a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , copy into a file to insert into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the picture and much more .
re@@ starts or stops the up@@ dating of the display . the up@@ sets of up@@ dating causes the required CPU time to 0 .
select the Update rate ( Very low , low , medium , high , very high ) . the higher the Update rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode , a select window is displayed . the selected area will appear in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically used your set short command to save files , open a new window , printing , new@@ com@@ rade ( with the button document again un@@ loaded in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fiers and thin@@ ly &amp; etc ; .
k@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier . you can use a range of screen to view the small printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people of benefit : from research or artists to the web designer or visually han@@ dicapped .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mag ( give either this URL into the address bar of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mag ) .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse pointing a while on the same place . it is thought to help people who em@@ ulate the re@@ peti@@ tive strain In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) Syndrome and those of each mouse click pains . however , this requires a bit exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can cope with the pain when clicking on the mouse and helps to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also suffer from the naked desire of the mouse . do you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , if you need a doctor if this is not yet happened .
to clari@@ fy it once more : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will avoid pain , which arise when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that are caused by moving the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be turned out differently .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click once you inter@@ rupt the movement .
is the smart re@@ loc@@ ating , power &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after the mouse button is em@@ ulated . move now the mouse , wait until the end of the motion . in this way you can run the drag by pressed mouse button . in this way , you can insert the drag by pressed mouse button . in this way , you can use a little exercise , but you get used to it fast .
this break @-@ time has to be sti@@ ff@@ led after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; one mou@@ sec@@ lick .
if the intel@@ lect is switched on , the fil@@ ming time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after lowering the mouse button , before leaving the mouse button , the mouse button is made again .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click through mouse displacement . this function is activated , followed by a break , a click to the right mouse button . a slow motion to the left and back leads to a double @-@ click . these movements are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt when the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can reduce the reaction time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose sound system and here the rider general . there is a shift sound buffer , which you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response time .
if this setting is selected , it will start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; starting in every start of &amp; K@@ DE ; this feature is currently only available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , in order to find out how you automatically start a program automatically .
if all the settings were set on the values , which were set when opening the dialog . have you already pressed the button on users , the settings will be reset to the last drop of users .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first use the pre@@ ferences . in particular , the smart re@@ loc@@ ating should you first off first . if you then used to get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later take the smart shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response time of &amp; K@@ DE ; if necessary .
first , you should be aware of what places a mou@@ sec@@ lick without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that do not pose a link , you can park in such places until you would like to use them again .
if your mouse is bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually rather simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come with the mouse ball in touch .
first , you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse is different from mouse . but it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roll@@ ers . these are attached to the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can easily scra@@ pe you with a flat blade or finger nails .
in very rare situations , the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you just started using the smart shift , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , which can stop the operation no longer by rele@@ asing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use below another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you run yourself a mouse click . here is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset , and you can re@@ work as usual .
problem : when you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse cli@@ cks and sets the cur@@ sor to another spot .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to place where you want to take it . however , use the mouse to a neutral area of mind if you are looking for a button . secure zones for the mouse po@@ inter is &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and front lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart shift , but I don &apos;t make it to edit text .
the smart re@@ loc@@ ating is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs its time before you can handle it . it &apos;s very probably possible to attach it to the cli@@ p@@ board or move it into the cli@@ p@@ board or add any other action . however , it will probably cause some problems :
do not use the smart re@@ loc@@ ating if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click the following text as follows : take a mouse click and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointing at the other end of the text and again the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will always be played when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses sound like a mou@@ sec@@ lick . so , you know exactly when the smart re@@ loc@@ ust begins . later , you can use the smart re@@ loc@@ ating without the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . but in addition , it requires some exercise .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; it should be installed on most system .
the audi@@ ble mouse cli@@ cks only is available if the system has a sound card and speaker , and are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; put the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointing out . this program has been developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome , and that the bet@@ ting of the bri@@ ck@@ est pain is prepared .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured that a certain period is waiting that a pulling process begins , before the mouse button is let off . in this way , pulling and disman@@ tle with the mouse can also be done .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program which allows users to talk to their computers for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; dum@@ b users can talk to computers for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talk rate that should be spoken again .
on the first page of the wi@@ zard ( left screen photo ) , enter the command , which is later used for the voice output of text . more details can be found in the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page you can choose the standard text password notebook . you can often choose used text matching , without having to type in . these passages can be processed naturally .
on the third side ( right screen photo ) you determine the dictionary for the Wor@@ lds . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can cancel the word lists using an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correct words are taken into the Wor@@ lds .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly and contains essentially an input field for the key@@ presses of your sentences ( the bottom white field in the screen ) and a c@@ ay@@ memory of the already spoken sentences ( the top white field in the screenshot ) .
when you turn k@@ mouth ; you can enter the sets of phr@@ ases you want in the input field , which you want to hear . every spoken sentence is attached to the memory of the memory . you can select from these sentences which are to be spoken again .
with the Settings menu entry k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the installation dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialogue includes two card cards , voice output and at@@ titudes , the page wor@@ shipping , and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the card @-@ card language , you specify the command to call the speech . in the box below , place the character encoding , which will pass the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; contains two types , add text on . select the check box when the text will remain unchanged as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is given as a parameter , and you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course the command to voice output language depends on your language generator . you will find this command in documentation about your language generator . examples of this will be found in App@@ endi@@ x .
using the best known as voice service &amp; k@@ mouth ; as first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the additional interface will be provided on this page . the kt@@ ach@@ d voice is a standar@@ dised interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first select box action after the selection of a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by a text pin or the choice of a text passage in the text password @-@ book or in the box for text matching bands .
when choosing Instant talk , the chosen passage is spoken directly and added in addition to the memory . when selecting into the input field , the chosen passage passage is initially only entered into the input field .
with the second select box , you can define it automatically , whether the text password register is to be stored automatically during the edit of the machining center .
with the selection of text password book , the book will be saved . if you choose changes , the text password textbook is not stored . select Before saving , will ask &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text password is to be saved .
the page Wor@@ lds is a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ lds . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a select field , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this radio box you can select the currently used dictionary for Wor@@ lds .
with the buttons on the right you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the sequence of books , or export them into one file . below the list you can set up the language and select the language for the dictionary .
in this source , select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is easily determined by count of the occurr@@ ence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert just correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask , which dic@@ tion@@ aries form dic@@ tion@@ aries , and how these weights are to be made .
with this option , place a new , empty Dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; re @-@ compiled words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary .
the main range of the window to edit text pass@@ ag@@ ons is two divided . in the upper part the text password are displayed as tree structure .
in the bottom part you can edit a selected entry . if you select a passage passage , you can change the passage passage or the related key icon . if you select a text password , you can only change its name .
to add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool bar or via a fol@@ dable menu .
you can change the sequence of text boxes or text passages by pulling with the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the chosen text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this will be used otherwise the selected parts of the expi@@ ration .
the chosen text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this will be used otherwise the selected parts of the expi@@ ration .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is located in the input field , this will be used otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the expi@@ ration .
this menu entry is crossed , a sliding tool bar with buttons used for frequently used commands . by mouse click on the sha@@ ded left side and pulling can be moved to another spot .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow passage in the bottom part of the main window with clu@@ es about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding table for text boxes are displayed directly below the tool@@ bar . through mouse click on the sha@@ ded left side and pulling can be moved to another spot .
you probably have the command for the language issue not correct or not fully entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output language output language . ( see installation dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to further details . )
Festival is a language issue system of Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch are currently supported . the license allows you to use the Festival free of charge and spread no restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for setting the speech output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival file .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and spread no restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the establishment of the language edition , it is believed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ t . the language output is possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as standard input option . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ ies into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to disman@@ tle the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text to phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to send the last sign of the text , so that an additional character is required . the full command is therefore more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / mu@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ e _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ sl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written into a line . it must be switched on data as standard input must be turned on .
the language version D@@ ha@@ on of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ further voice service , which provides all &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different language output systems .
since setting the language requirement is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you need to use only possible kt@@ ach@@ d as voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to setting the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the installation dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires approximately 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who can not speak to spend a text by the calcul@@ ator . it will already be saved through a list of pro@@ longed pro@@ positions that the user can always be re @-@ spending again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . on the computer , a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the language issue system of &amp; K@@ DE ; - is a modules of existing service which allows each application to read text via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; K@@ DE ; for language output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a joint application interface for &amp; K@@ DE ; programm@@ ers ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS skills . even users are offering interesting options .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; even if &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications are embedded .
the speech output is performed via the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , which uses different background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc ; .
enables the creation of language expenditure on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; program .
in future : support for speech @-@ up languages such as Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and speech @-@ up @-@ met@@ a @-@ language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the language edition service of &amp; K@@ DE ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers .

before you &amp; kt@@ ts , you will need to install program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also
at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card interface is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card card is displayed .
most of the T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer various languages and voices , so also different male or female or female , or those who are called in volume or speed . you should also set multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts . use the speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise the standard speaker is used .
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with multiple print ratings for the same printer .
when you click on the map @-@ card actors in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card interface is displayed . this will then automatically start when you launch a kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and not yet another speaker is set up .
all subscri@@ bers already appear in this list . the preferred speaker will appear above in the list . the su@@ preme spokes@@ man is used for voice output when there is no nar@@ r@@ ator .
select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of speaker in the list determines also their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
select a voting type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a j@@ ars and girls at choice .
if you click here , on the map the new spokes@@ man on the board map speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to map material general and check if language output is checked , so that the T@@ TS @-@ service of &amp; K@@ DE ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts to read text . click on the card order to create text applications and manage . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language selection of &amp; K@@ DE ; click on the map of the map . click here to set up some general options .
mark this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this is the start of the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can create text orders and read instructions . see . remove the marking , will keep K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system of &amp; K@@ DE ; disabled .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr end is running &amp; added ; on , provided the field voice output is checked ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is labeled and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the pre @-@ reading is completed .
with the buttons in this series , you can start text orders , stop , stop and record again .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; read cli@@ p@@ board or read a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all settings will be adopted on all sides .
the card order orders will only appear when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map of the map and check the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check out the text , which is to read , and select the main menu tools . after short time the language edition should start .
it is almost always convenient to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre@@ tension and other un@@ visible brands are also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can read the text displayed . check out the text which is to be read , and select the main menu tools to read text . then the language edition should start .
this also works if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; K@@ DE ; you will notify you of your fixed events . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ops .
in &amp; counter ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can set up various types of messages . you can set &amp; counter ; for example , set up a message in which your nickname occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C news text .
support a &amp; K@@ DE ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry messages in the Settings menu . this program offers possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy depending on the application .
filter for the drawing table provide a good way to correct , correct or correct to correct messages . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases than provided . read also .
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal working with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filtering text , before it will be sent to the speech of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace false language or abbrevi@@ ations , or to handle certain short@@ com@@ ings of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the edition of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will advance all other orders and maintains this orders . if the edition of the screen reader is read , the orders received are resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after the release of the warning .
News have the next great priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text to read on a website you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth . &amp; K@@ DE ; noti@@ fications are also news . read about this .
the rest are simple text orders . every order you encounter orders on the card order is a text contract . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that are used for text applications . text orders are intended for the output longer texts that have no special ur@@ gency .
all four orders will be operated in queu@@ es , except the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such pre @-@ reads will be stopped and finished .
first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the issue of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages , and text applications as well as on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News .
filter edit the text , and enter it on the next filter . currently , there are three types of filters .
filters are implemented as modules . in the future , there can still be further types of filters .
drawing parts of a text by other text . the resulting parts can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions . the creation of chat @-@ che@@ ek @-@ che@@ ek will be delivered with text or form@@ at@@ ted messages ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; Modification use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in scope of supply of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are used for the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program , which send the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . for example , if you have set a female voice , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. read about it .
each of these different filter has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter sets that his rules does not apply , he continues to keep the text in the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; K@@ DE ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; it will be edited by all activated filters , which have been installed on the page below . editing the filter is made up in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of inserted normal filters . if a filter isn &apos;t checked , it is not enabled and is not used . filter will run the range from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of fil@@ ters , and it will be displayed next to the following setup di@@ alogues .
for setting of character co@@ aches , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as compar@@ ative patterns . if these patterns are exchanged in the text , the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text . large and small @-@ text is not considered .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name if you just need to distinguish themselves from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column form@@ ity , replacing it in accordance with the string from the column list . the list is executed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can store a list of words or regular expressions from a file , store the current list or delete . download a list of a file , the entries from the file is attached to the existing list .
here is a language registered , the filter is used only if the speaker for the text job is one of the registered languages . click on the button to view a list of the languages . you can also press multiple languages if you press the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ button .
if a value is registered here , the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
you can use the q@@ d@@ bus program with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers have to leave you . if for example , q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 can only be copied .
the drawing filter is applied only in the text , if all conditions apply to one entry in the box di@@ esen filter if match . are all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
by comparison , the character filter is used regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . words have to be limited by separ@@ ating characters ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual , you will find no guidance for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the par@@ am@@ big@@ ti@@ ls package .
&amp; XML ; re@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from one format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such re@@ shaping . however , it can only be installed on well @-@ form@@ ulated XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program must be installed on your system .
specify the path to the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , is also enough x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
you can send texts to a particular speaker with the speaker selection , which is set up on the map card speaker , or by a speaker with certain characteristics . you can design@@ ate the text by k@@ mail from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts a text to the filter , it is searching for a speaker for the text . the speaker is displayed on the basis of the speaker features that send the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and select the features of the speaker &apos;s speaker . speaking with the speaker filter you can over@@ write the chosen nar@@ r@@ ator .
here is a value registered , the filter is applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Select , you can call this button on the button to get help in the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here , place the properties of your desired text editor . if the text fulfilled the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected to preview the desired requirements for the test . click on the button to display the dialog talking .
use these buttons to save or load your inter@@ ferences , or delete all settings .
the speaker filter only then applied to the text , if any conditions apply to one entry in the box di@@ esen filter if you apply . you need to apply at least a condition .
the language version API , by &amp; K@@ DE ; with the programmer can give your applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ Bus ; .

none of the mentioned language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ re@@ shaping filter , but not read when using the module for the festival .
due to a bug in Festival 1.@@ 95 , you need to install the ( male British ) Voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone to use S@@ able at all . so , if you do not need to read this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain signs or interaction character seem to cause errors to cause syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences ski@@ pped or just chew@@ ing wil@@ ds . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure the option is set to correct the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain signs or words , this may be solved by a character filter filter . see .

the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , used by &amp; kt@@ ts , have their own license which you will find in the related documentation or in the relevant web pages . there are also voices that own a license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source archive , you can download the package deal with &amp; kt@@ ts . here you can download the source code from k@@ de@@ pl@@ under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / K@@ DE / .
contains many languages , a list of all supported languages supported on the htt@@ p : / / specialities ac@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / tri@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ wah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibiza .
KT@@ TS works with each language syn@@ thesizer , which can be launched onto the command line in one &amp; console ;
the list of the above languages can be in@@ complete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , drag the description of Syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . look at the website of kt@@ ops . , according to information , which are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for use of another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , you sit with the developing team in connection .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filters is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including packages of c@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from the source code , from the source code for k@@ de@@ duct or to have downloaded a tar@@ ball every night , please translate and install the program with the following commands :
before you &amp; kt@@ ops ; use , check first if speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher with your language syn@@ thesizer correctly works . in addition , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ sk@@ ript SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops , which is used to develop the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed so further that the device of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user can restart - or drop @-@ off , repeat the output or break off .
if an application has an application to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can request a female English speaker for example . if you have set up a speaker , this is used for example a female English speaker . if you choose a speaker , otherwise it will automatically choose the best appropriate speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; added ; a speaker chosen , see in .
when you click on the map speaker , click to add or edit a speaker into the list or to edit , the card interface setup is displayed . as an example , the module is shown in the module for Festival Interactive . details on modules will be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable events program . if the path is included to the festival in P@@ AT@@ H , you just need to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text , which is handed over to the festival . it is true that western languages are used to use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak languages ( ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 ) .
with these sli@@ ders , you can adjust volume , microphone speed and pitch of synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some regulator and display these grey , you can &apos;t choose this settings .
some voices like multi @-@ sy@@ n voices need to be loaded for several seconds to be loaded up . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded with the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( in higher memory consumption ) the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have no subject yet furnished ( or do not forget to click Apply ) .
if this check box is marked , the window of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is displayed in the system window . otherwise it is visible only the symbol kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is labeled and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr it is not running , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . by doing so , you have the possibility to read or to control .
here are all orders listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the straight set . the speaker ID is equivalent to the column ID on the card voice .
with the buttons in this series you can select a full way in the order that is selected in the list below , pre @-@ or reset . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK all the changes of settings ( also on the other card cards ) and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map card audio . see also .
here are only text orders listed and managed . issues of screen editing , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . further information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it was compiled &amp; added ; either without support for the corresponding audio module , or kt@@ ats ; can &apos;t charge the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output is to be used , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you select AL@@ SA , select the PCM device here . see also
adjust the speaking speed here . 50@@ mg ; % equivalent to about half and 200@@ s ; % of the double normal microphone speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program SO@@ X must be installed .
click Apply to adopt the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA equipment includes all PCM devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , choose Standard .
on this map you can set special actions that will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language contracts :
the edition of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will advance all other orders and will hold this orders . once the edition of the screen reader has been read , the received orders will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have priority &apos;s priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after the warning of the warning .
News have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the messages . if you &amp; eg ; just a long text on a web site , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless , to meet someone who enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen @-@ reader , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queu@@ e long .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sounds are active as well as introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card card are only valid for normal text @-@ orders . for messages , war@@ nings , and the issues of screen editing , there are no special actions , if this is interrupted by a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications .
mark this check box to switch the reading of &amp; K@@ DE ; notification noti@@ fications . if this setting is not checked , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and added ; read no noti@@ fications before .
if this attitude will be selected , noti@@ fications of which a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog box will appear in which you want to add the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message that &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation , sent when someone mentioned your nickname in an IR@@ C message .
all events , for which there is nothing else stated in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this radio box to determine what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event meets . you have the following selection options :
if you choose pre @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can enter here the properties of the desired microphone . default cho@@ oses the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the map speaker as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . is specified for a specific event of a particular application , this is executed . otherwise the action will be executed for all other events of certain application . as last possibility the action comes to tra@@ ms that was specified under standard ( all other events ) .
the event all noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can define the noti@@ fications noti@@ fications as follows :
use the button Save to store the settings for the messages stored in a file . use the kno@@ b to start stored settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click on delete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted .
the speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling the voice and pitch . in addition , trademarks for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of pron@@ unci@@ ation , for example , abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are present :
you need to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the standard voice which uses the SS@@ ML output .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ lt ; SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on .
&lt; ? &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE &apos; / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; htt@@ p : / / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN , &quot; who slept in my bed ? asked Mama bear . who slept in my bed ? asked the bear . &#93; &#93; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation recognition filter ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , as only the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order . so you can also stop or break down and break down , even if the speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers does not support this directly .
here you can see the pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can change its settings or add a set of pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters , but it is exc@@ essi@@ vely dist@@ orted .
in the easiest way to check out the selection of speaking selection by selection . place the speaker selection contracts , what speaker &amp; kt@@ ts ; select some features and check out how the selection of microphone has changed . you must naturally have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then can start to read faster with the pre @-@ read , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block which can last very long ,
you can then subscribe to the card ticket orders or break down , even if the speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter is set up automatically when you start m@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it can not be switched off , only away . change nothing at this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
in terms of proposition identification filter , compare the text with a regular expression of proposition ( Dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the set limits . ( tab@@ ul@@ ators are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard @-@ pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter is re@@ tains the character recognition filter .
S@@ BD filter will never be applied on &amp; K@@ DE ; messages ( k@@ ins@@ ) , war@@ nings , messages , or the issue of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern .
if you have removed the normal pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file .
you can over@@ write the archive settings for the application . the card card is displayed if
use of the standard speakers ( the top on the card card ) . in other words , there are no speaker characteristics .
use of the appropriate speaker , which displays all characteristics of a speaker speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings ; otherwise cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ts . otherwise cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker made at the beginning the original set features .
select the method for entering the desired alarm properties by clicking on one of the select buttons .
if this feature doesn &apos;t matter . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , you don &apos;t give anything .
mark this check box when the property is supposed to have other features . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in the issue of issue , this property is always treated as priority . the only case if you may want to specify the attribute language , lies ahead , if you know a specific application will be sent out in another language as the language of the working environment .
to use all characteristics in the field , the closest speaker is to delete , click on the select button , and then use the speaker , which is the closest to the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( no order number is required 0 ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crash@@ es immediately if it started . I have compiled Deb@@ ug support but I don &apos;t get any trace@@ ability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts . probably , you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . at G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , you may not install any compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or un@@ install G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work when I play with another application of music . if I stop a text contract , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message which says : to open PCM .
on your system , the problem is that conflicts with AL@@ SA will prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices . references for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org .
I downloaded an additional voice for the internet from the internet . I have installed it and can use it at Festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr this voice doesn &apos;t show this voice .
add in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / vocals the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; where you have found the voice to the developers .
at the card board audio , there &apos;s a setting speed . so this works , the program SO@@ X has to be installed and about the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers such as Festival Interactive offer itself on the card card for speaker equipment . depending on the chosen voice , this actively or in@@ active .
the settings for the speaking speed will be ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( this is that the HTML in SS@@ ML is transformed . ) De@@ activate either the filter for conversion of &amp; HTML ; according to XML ; ( see ) or if you are quite cour@@ ageous , change the .x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML conversion filter , and set up the microphone speed up .
I don &apos;t make it that web pages are read with a female voice . I created a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ats ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . this makes the x@@ sl file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ but the GEN@@ DER tags . it also applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a custom custom filter filter , and now I can proceed in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer a full way or go back . on the box orders the order is displayed only from a set . what am I doing wrong ?
inter@@ section symbols ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation marks , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) you may not filter out . use a filter for pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition for these characters instead .
Al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org )

some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio issue . if your system is counting , you can &apos;t play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ats ; free@@ zes another when you start a text job and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
with as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support real breaks . if you have a text job in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current proposition is still read .
the SO@@ X audio program is used for the general setting of speaking speed , but otherwise not necessarily necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install SO@@ X by command apt @-@ get install SO@@ X . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs are already included .
if you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; as tar@@ ball ( with tar packages archive ) , sign up as a normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a matching folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands :

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer whose source code is revealed . quality of the voices is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , microphone speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that are delivered with the festival . would you like to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer .
this voice sets the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage stage . un@@ zip the software at festival / li@@ b / vocals / russian . if you enter the Russian voices you need to enter the votes ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic acid ( 8 bit@@ - ) coding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution list . for example , you are looking for the first CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the coding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ ic like for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . then , Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ik@@ al analysis and &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; creates from it the audio issue . the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; program and the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; - voices can be downloaded from

Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff language syn@@ thesizer , which has been written in &amp; Java ; it is necessary to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . using &amp; Java ; cannot set pitch , volume or microphone speed .
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be connected to the command line .
best you use a command to send the voice output into a temporary audio file ( wav ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio file .
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows administration of network interfaces , the rout@@ ings and the DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to enable users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module interface will be displayed in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network networking settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and its drivers have to be operational , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and the setting of network characteristics enabled .
in most cases drivers are installed for the network hardware and other devices for installing and Linux ; installed and set up . network appliances will be added later , drivers have to be loaded by adap@@ ting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network Settings module is loaded , if the network settings will be selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module interface will try to automatically detect the platform used by the module .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the draft option is offered . it is the platform from the list , which will meet the distribution and Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and best . by marking the setting non @-@ again questions can be hit permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will then be pre @-@ set .
changing the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode . before , all options are displayed in grey , meaning the settings can only be considered , the change mode is not possible at the bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password mode at the bottom of the module .
the module &apos;s functionality is available in the system administration mode . this is divided into three riders :
the network interface interfaces to manage network appliances of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
setting up network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click of the button ... in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking on the Advanced Ex@@ tended settings displays the dialog with further options .
with the selection Automati@@ cally the TCP / IP settings are collected by a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP address will be provided with the startup of the system . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the selection manual , without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , the TCP / IP address can be specified . in the input field IP address the required TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mas@@ ke is fixed the sub@@ net@@ mask .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alize the network interface in boats . if the initi@@ alization is not allowed , this option should not be activated .
the values in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address will not be used in the network . entering a already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you may find if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network appliances can be switched or switched off on required . switching on a network device is done by selecting from the list and click interface ....
network appliances can be switched or switched off depending on demand . switching off a activated network device is done by selecting from the list and click the interface ....
speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in local sub@@ net , which medi@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is provided by default for TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ missions .
if there is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain extension through the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer calls htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will solve this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the nam@@ esp@@ ace solution enables a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed .@@ DNS entries can be arranged through a selection of a contract and exec@@ ut@@ ures in the list with buttons or shut@@ ting in the priority .
clicking button Add ... from the group &apos;s host solution can be added to a DNS server . it will add the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver dialog .
first , you need to enter the DNS server address and then click the button Add . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group &apos;s group to name resolution , select one entry and then click on the button .... It will edit dialog .
the list of nam@@ e@@ ally known hosts ob@@ serves computer @-@ to @-@ IP address links for TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily when boats are available , if no DNS servers are available . in small , enclosed networks it can replace DNS @-@ server .
normally , the list contains the list nam@@ e@@ ally known hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses support . these are still in the current version of IP should replace in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known host and click Add .... The New Ad@@ alias will be displayed .
enter the name of the known host and click the button . if the well @-@ known computer has several alias names , de button add multiple times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a well @-@ known machines from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Conver@@ ts Calcul@@ ator is displayed .
you can run one of the following tasks , then click OK to get the list of static hosts .
the settings set in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be removed .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; K@@ DE and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in one &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphic surfaces such as k@@ package or installation tool of their distribution .
for this case , Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE is sufficient for this case ; not , but in addition , development packages are required with libraries and other things .
only experienced users are recommended . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should afford this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology are given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change configuration files discussed .
this section can not replace good knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PCs are medi@@ ated into a small ( home ) network .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 has never expected large spread . this description is therefore concentrated in the near future . therefore , this description focuses on the spread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the note that IP address can be connected to a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator if available , DH@@ CP can be used . definitely , the IP address can not be chosen as usual !
when replacing a own small ( home ) network should be selected the IP address from a specially designed for this purpose to avoid IP address accounts with the global ( Internet ) network . addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , therefore its any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a Gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks usually use addresses in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 hosts .
in addition , the net@@ mask will usually be set at 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all machine participants are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = of its own host ) . the standard route is required for the IP continuation .
the network address 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed loop .
in this part , the configuration files are located , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed in DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if in the case of active DSL connections , another content is defined as specified .
for &amp; SuSE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand can be seen as expected .

&amp; dat ; is a ensuring program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the opportunity to create multiple archives on a band . the first was the capacity of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective out@@ pack . the second goal was to answer a question that made my wife : how much longer takes it when you sec@@ ures ?
before a band can be used , it must be tied by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can happen on three types :
&amp; k@@ dat ; do the band back and reads the pre@@ st@@ ressing of the band . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the pioneer in the band will not be asked if the band will be form@@ at@@ ted .
recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the anticip@@ ation , search for the appropriate index on your record . can &apos;t be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index is to be re @-@ created .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol changes for the tape drive to indicate that the band was tied up . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the Ban@@ des can now be searched by the entry of the entry for the band .
in front of the dis@@ card of the band , first integration must first be solved . there are three methods to achieve this :
&amp; dat ; gives an amend@@ ment to the tape for the band that the integration of the tape was solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be cast out without any danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band species must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can use to save data . this process does not correspond to the form@@ att@@ ing at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process needs to be form@@ at@@ ted before using the band by &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ at@@ ted . Flo@@ ppy tape drives are usually form@@ at@@ ted a form of tape ahead , DA@@ T drives .
after entering the tape called and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing tape . all data on the band are lost ! after completion of the form@@ att@@ ing process , the tape is automatically bound and is ready to use .
before you encounter the securing procedure , you must select the saf@@ est files . it can happen on three types :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be saved in this file or folder .
mark a safety profile in the tree . only files are stored in the profile specified .
select files in local file tree with a ha@@ k@@ ite . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are secured .
right click on the local file @-@ tree , and select in the Sh@@ ech@@ es menu .
once the backup was initiated , the settings will open for backup . in this dialogue , you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog indicates the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the files for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the files for the band with a ha@@ k@@ ite . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are checked .
click on the right button in one of the archives and select the Check menu .
once the test procedure has been launched , the dialog settings for verification . in this dialogue , you can check your selection and change the folder for checking .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears . this dialogue shows the progress of the testing process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before setting up , the files you need to be restored will be selected . this can be done on two types :
select a file or folder in one of the archives created for the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
mark the desired files from one of the archives with a ha@@ k@@ ite . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be restored .
to restore the mouse button , click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select the ...
once the recovery process was launched , the dialog can be rest@@ oring for recovery . in this dialogue , you can check your selection and change the folder for restoration .
if you have confirmed the settings for rest@@ oring , the dialog appears . this dialogue shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to recre@@ ate the band inde@@ x@@ file using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two kinds of tape :
this will create a safety profile with the just selected files and default settings . you can use the following settings for a safety profile :
the current work@@ book in which the backup should be made . the list of transparent files is automatically updated according to the correct working order .
for all folders , which are listed under backup files , is that only those files are stored on the same file system , such as the folder . folders that are on other file systems can be ordered separately under backup files . every entry is considered by tar independent of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental Backup , a snap@@ shot file will be used . only files are saved since then .
the name of the file , which is used for determining the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before calling the tar . this causes all files to be saved and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; gt ; and ; lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of the creation of this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the K@@ D@@ at menu option ... in the Settings menu , you can use the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must refer to non @-@ re@@ winding option of the tape device .
if this setting is active , transfers &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is tied to load , it is necessary to load before reading or write operations .
if the option is switched on , tries &amp; dat ; to lock the throw at the tape drive . possibly , this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , when loos@@ ing the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically the band will be cast off . do not use this option with Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is switched on , try &amp; dat ; the hardware block size for tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive provides information .
if &amp; dat ; a band form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only prove a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this string is host : seconds , whereby the name of the full name of the system is form@@ at@@ ted on which the band has been form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds since the ep@@ och has been form@@ at@@ ted in which the band has been form@@ at@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives created directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental f@@ uses .
check the contents of a backup . this symbol is only active when a band is integrated .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; for experienced users who can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system allows you to get information about your system , or where the system offers the different protocol files . moreover , allows users to access the fast access , for example , on information related to their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps to understand what your computer power in the background is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can not know where you can receive information about your system , or where the system is depos@@ ited the different protocol files .
in addition , offers &amp; ks@@ system log ; experienced users for quick access to information about problems that can appear on their server . &amp; ks@@ system log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features which can be filtered and evaluated using certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; ks@@ os log ; a number of useful functions . among other things , include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included , and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen photo , features &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions available , with whose help the single protocol @-@ lines of a protocol @-@ file easily filter and sorting . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; ks@@ system log ; first the main protocol @-@ file of the system - to open the system protocol ; it will not be opened as a small news window , so you have started using system ver@@ wal@@ ter@@ right . usually the protocol files are normally found in the file / var / log , for the normal user usually don &apos;t have any jus@@ tification for reading .
you can also use the filter bar , in order to filter according to a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or in the filter bar . in the default setting , the drop line will be displayed next to the selected filter . then a protocol @-@ line is displayed only if one of the columns contain the string of the filter pattern .
you can also select another associated entry at this site . in the protocol @-@ file system protocol , select the column process , and wear it in the filter bar called the name of a process , so shows you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all the protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you identify the key protocol lines . protocol @-@ lines of level errors are displayed with a striking color as a protocol @-@ lines of the level note . the color display of the protocol @-@ lines can be switched off .
if you want to show certain process ( for example , in the system protocol or the cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can select the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . that may be useful for example if you want to investigate the output of a certain command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the option on new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new upcoming protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate bases . to open this feature , use the entries in menu window to open up and manage . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a protocol for viewing .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website based on htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ .@@ D@@ ort . you will find more recent information about the reference sources of &amp; ks@@ systems log .

welcome to &amp; K@@ DE ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also so called ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section shows a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the System V In@@ it quickly evolved into the standard for control of the program starts when driving the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ in@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about this : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is why somebody could try to expand a machine on System V In@@ it without creating a re@@ installation and re @-@ format . therefore , you need to secure that the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was one .
the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort is r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot scripts . in principle , you need a script for any system service which you want to launch on a other Run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ set , which will only be launched . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be used under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it does not have much use for it . you can also run a r@@ c.@@ c. in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something with the serial connection .
the kernel is looking for different places following the program in@@ it and starts the first he finds .
the default run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you would like to change it , then you can restart / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and change the 3 . if you have done something , then you will start to re@@ boot the system and run the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this file are no correct files . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how starts and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written so that there is an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start this scripts out by hand on the command line :
this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the K includes , the script will stop the argument stop . if it contains a S , the script will start the script .
some people want a simple way to build machines for many purposes . I could be &amp; eg ; a server @-@ run@@ level have to run only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; additionally , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starting .
here you will learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another index is simple , to be tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of availability Systems to one of the six run@@ level to start this level ( or stop ) .
you can also shift scripts between Run@@ lev@@ eln or change the position within one level by changing it somewhere else . this will only be done when it comes out of its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will not happen if they have an entry from the field of availability system services .
note : entries are moved when you move these into a new field . to copy them only to a new Run@@ @-@ level , you need to select copying from the menu Edit or select from the context menu , and even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of action .
sometimes the sor@@ ption number of an entry may not be calculated . in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries , before you can try again to include the system service .
note : there is no option to restore entries that were thrown into the tr@@ ash bin . be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ulator button to activate the various work@@ ranges ( availability , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous .
to shift one entry into another Run@@ level , shift it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the button button to change the properties dialog . use the tab@@ ulator button to accept the changes in order to accept the changes , or press the Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu will require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets will be taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the Standard Run@@ lev@@ eling and now launching the machine re@@ mot@@ ely . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level on a reasonable value ( 3 should usually be in order ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , then you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way , such as system services are started , simpli@@ fy the configuration for proprietary components in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution : please check if all configuration files are present , which are required from the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) just stop without message when their configuration files are not present or wrong .
the meaning of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about Run@@ level , so that this manual may be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program , you can manage users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; read more
after you have made changes , you need to save this . either use the tool@@ bar symbol or entry in the menu file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window is made of two cart@@ on cards , user and user list . to edit the desired user , or the desired group with double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog User and Group properties .
some maps are displayed only if you have extended system settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a map card will be created , if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as specified in BSD Uni@@ xes .
the card card password management appears , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as BSD UNIX .
this card card is only activated and initi@@ alized for at least one embedded file limits ( Qu@@ ota ) and initi@@ alized ( identi@@ fies the file rati@@ a.@@ user / quota a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , users can be changed for each user , where the number of limitations are included in KB :
