<seg id="13">The module & FSView module; for & Konqueror; provides a further view of objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various icons and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The particularity of & FSView; consists of showing the size of objects with the help of a so-called Tree-map. every object is represented by a rectangle, whose area is proportional to its size. this size does have to possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the suborderly objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object is.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; the size of a folder reflects the size of a file or folder, with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is specified. in this way, large files can be recognized even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. thus, & FSView may be considered as a graphic and interactive version of the UNIX ® command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; it is an entry in the treemap representation of a rectangle that represents a file or file in your filesystem. to easier navigation have the rectangles of meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The colour of a rectangle, which is switched over view colour mode, may be either depth for easy detection of the connections or the illustration of another file association like name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. if enough space is used, only if enough space is used, or if enough space is used, or if the surface of subordinates should be used (whereby the actual position of limitations of the Treemap occur). in addition, you can define the relative position of labelling in rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of production algorithms for Treemaps should usually be kept that the area is proportional to size of the entry. in case of the Treemap in & FSView; this goal is not always available. please note that less space is lost for frames, if the square is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As distribution of the area of an entry to the subordinate entries, the implementation will be left. here it is necessary for marking and avoidance of space losses incurable by as possible, the best methods of these are lines, columns or recursive.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can define the minimal area for entry about the menu entry level. instead, an autosomal pattern is drawn in the area of the orderly entry to indicate that this area is actually covered by a subordinated entry.</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera can also be realized as a USB mass storage device. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digitised; used the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital cameras, which has an constantly rising number of more than 800 cameras supported. gPhoto2 also supports the picture transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol that has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to machines and other peripherals without the need additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. as photos in general big files are and broadcasts on the serial port slowly, this connection is now outdated. & digitised; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support has been needed to read the role models of digikam reliably. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you could possibly be able to perceive images or the production could be very slow.</seg>

<seg id="149">I dare to claim, if you don't know more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you will not know how many photos you have. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then use very fast searching and secure booking based on you with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you have to organize something in your system. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you need to decide whether other access to your photos is to be stored or on a network drive & etc; please make sure you need to switch to a larger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly via your location. if you are using enough photos, then you will use subfolder as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images that you can print or publish at a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning the photos, archiving, work processes, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% are archives and 5% workfiles and you will then not want to organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stacking processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplified a backup strategy and migration. you will always know whether you are looking for an original or an derived picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata to save the metadata in & digitised; this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data will be written into the file. if you forgot this, then you can save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the respective point in the menu album.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change? there is & digitised, they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, because you should now select any photo words, labelling and evaluation. of course, you can select all the pictures that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now use keyword, key words, as you are often called on other programs, or continue in categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogised pictures from another source with built-in key words, then & digitised; automatically add the tree to you. the hierarchy in the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by using a sub-tree to another. the changed words are passed by & digitised; updated during the undertrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overcut. this is a very rough representation, as each block of metadata is made in truth of many sections. filenames and calendar data are characteristics of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keyword - the next section refers to protector or comments, the third important tool for cataloging your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">They don't want to see most of your photos just seeing you, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. you are certainly interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance it is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look at it closer, then catch some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this the landing field of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French mandy 60 years after landing. Wow! one begins to dream to dream associations, memories, the historical span is present again, you may even hear the silence. so the labelling has changed completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others viewing your photos, the title is possibly more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you have pictures, you should tell a story. remember, the key is to help the viewer to help Him over the motive that you moves you understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect, if it has the strength only with a labeling for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digitised, you can save a lot of text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), and you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time. KDE will even export it to your wishes for your wishes and / or the title of Web-gallery. you need to tell the story so for the opening of the video.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times ahead of GPS? when you need to find a different city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet on GoogleEarth? good, because with pictures the train drives the spatial presentation now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to use geolocalisation are already innumerable and become even deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your journeys through pictures with geographic data. however, you can also export the photos at the reception. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and refers to the practice of copyright to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also applicable in all changed versions, so also for working other.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tell you what information is done in the setup page of & digitised; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for author and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who has created the photograph. if it is not desired to protect the photographer's name, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographers, then it cannot be changed. this field does not support compmas nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for the author's line): linked to the author. this field contains the job description of the photographer. examples of this can be titles as an employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the car field, this field must be filled out.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonymous with provider): use the bidder field to identify who works this photo. if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here. if the picture is a camp photo, the group / agency is offered here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not offer a little more than basic knowledgeable in the work with calculator, this is a little more than base knowledge in the work with calculator. for individuals, this is very important to the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digitised in the near future, a module for staple processing is available.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record defect, record failure, power surges, ECC, transmission error, ageing of storage media, restoration, redundancy, desaster neck, life time, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we can't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or fire. this kind of losses are the same which can happen to you with traditional paper photos or negative. in this section it is about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which has a loss of data.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem of CDs / DVDs, this must be treated more and more expensive than a couple of years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs about a couple of years. there are offers of gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe that is in your discretion.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you can use good discos and good recording devices. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write a lot of reliable. so it turns the right to choose.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to mistakes, even if you have just written only. this is why they use a control system mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and the controls. despite this massive protective cover it is needed for formatting, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there's a favourable program called IsoBuster that seems to work wonders at CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and Linux; but there are also similar applications that are not available on Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, Flashmedia, USB drive, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray discs seem to save the format war against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything that has been said to CDs and DVDs also applies to the Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burning the media with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-propriated format. read the media using a description, date & author license and afterwards in a clean, dark dry and before animals protected place. do not forget the data to the next generation of media before you read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disco-manufacturers keep your statistics for itself. their manufacturers are producing a new disk, but not the data. Google represents a major field study about the error mechanisms of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: discos last the longest when you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. in case of lower temperature sensors, the most frequent error cause, SMART can terminate this error. some of SMART occur immediately. these are especially readers and publishing counter. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is just a complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a blackout if you have backed the files, but these losses usually cause no big problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric equipment can not make a lot of power, that can take advantage of devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these can cause severe damage on your computer, these anomalies may cause serious damage, hardware change, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against electricity spikes is a overvoltage protection. this is a device that is part of energy saving absorbs and the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug bar. remember that not any plug-in bar contains a overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for a overvoltage protection, then you should ensure that it guarantees the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also ensure that it protects the protection against lightening and protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since there is an overvoltage of each cable to your computer, you should also make sure that all peripherals can be connected to your system. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems, which also contain a phone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are especially developped for notebooks and therefore contain very small and you also contain the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for travelling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While a overvoltage protection your system protects against smaller variations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection from overvoltage, these devices can automatically shut down the battery energy when a power outage occurs. some models even allow them to work until the current is running. if you buy a UPS, you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements like a overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of battery and the attached software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Don't forget the potential risk to prevent your computer system and compare its security in power problems with the cost of avoiding these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you consider how good your computer is protected by it. finally, you should always think all cables before you go to the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service is S3 - Simple Storage Service - easy storage service. with the correct configuration you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software. Google shared storage is another popular offer that you can save any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are compared to the hard drives at home but very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you must send the data on comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important pictures. it is not a bad solution, but there is no general safety solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo Community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are limited to photos. their free memory is limited to 1GB. the professional version will give you more available, in the case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 a year you get unlimited memory, which should be checked out in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data protection, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors will be automatically cleaned up to the TCP protocol and include a backup and a shared memory. so they are desaster safe.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transmission are susceptible to transmission errors. the filesystem zfs and btrfs are at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one says it happened when a transmission error occurred. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you have destroyed a photo and this is quite excited to have it in your computer. no one seems to have thought it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a considerably more secure data path than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power parts are another source of transmission, as they generate intermittances within the data flow. in normal filesystem these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not affected especially of transmission problems, you should see in the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems appears to be one of two candidates who can handle on low level and can be highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is also available for & Linux; and Windows is also available.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs file system. it is still in Alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms that use it and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the core.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate these two factors for 86% of data loss in notebook and 46% on the job systems. in notebooks, the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss because of viruses is less common than most. it leads to a lower damage, as such as theft or re-installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under Linux; no longer yet been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone for data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the most common file systems. find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the examination process at a sudden interruption occurs during one operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are removed 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology is further developed, there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer removed from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras are used in the direction of the 10 megapixelsensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the final result are optimal for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have improved its limit for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive is now available for 100 & euro; so don't have any other data loss for data loss. 6% of all PCs are often subject to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous like the reinstallation of your operating system, make the exchange of panels or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, lightening strikes you if the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster suggests locally and destroys one quantity. forget aircraft disaster: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they normally affect an entire room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore Desasterers always means not local store. bring your fuses the stairs up, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic. if you have a backup which is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files are to be secured. it is a moment, without history, and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential: a backup of files that have been changed since the last complete recovery. creates a complete moment of schedule to two points: the complete recovery and the last differential.</seg>
<seg id="222">To create a fuse of files that have been changed since the last backup. this creates several moments. you can restore the original status at any time again. this fuse comes from a versioning system next with the exception that it is only canceled and not continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool which you can easily set up on your machines. unlike the script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts copied rsync only the difference of files that have been really changed. this happens and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or any other opetic media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach makes you enough time to discover and recover. at the same time, you come for the backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. at the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly moment for at least one month and a moment for every month. every further slider should be done manually, after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored IPTC information stored in the image file stored IPTC data, original storage, memory, scalability, media, restore images and metadata, copy the pictures to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visibility,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable pictures the next 40 years survival, that is about the period in which you really interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you need to consider and re-assess everything today. unfortunately, there is no other way to have a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask how the current system is backward compatible. the less varieties you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. so, if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and fuse technology, or change your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the subject to change a system in its size. this means always enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability with you and the area you want to have placed on a dedicated plate or partition. on * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and relies on a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record has been detected by the system, but do not hang it up.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollars; dd if = / dev / SDC # source is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBI; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & dollars; resize2fs / dev / corc1 # change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software gives it, you can create this yourself. this task will be easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format which disappears slowly from the market, so you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard. however, it can save a lot more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata for improved colour assignments to heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that it has relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF needs and has a slow compression. this format we would like to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as an image format. TIFF can store in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression season. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted from many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a licensed and open resource format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been based on the TIFF / EP format and is obligated to use metadata. a handful camera manufacturer DNG is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is perhaps one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. file information are stored in an extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers draw it from an original image, mostly in the raw format, but it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it may appear to problems with the link between the metadendatei and the image file, and how it is mentioned above, you should consider whether you use DNG as container and place everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards, which include a large range of application purposes and modelling, discussions and community work in DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and reconnaissance efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader, or the scanner. so long the pictures are on the camerum, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert blank files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a sensitive processing, you can use external programs. if you are editing the pictures again with & digitised, then you should add the metadata. these were cut off by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the machined images of copyright with a digital watermark. export it only then in Webgaleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact page, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digitised; in section adding a photos to an album, you'll find a description as you can already add on your hard drive. but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your Albendata bank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiarrived; connect these with the machine, turn the camera on display mode and turn them off. another description will be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. when the connection is made, a fertig indicator will appear at the bottom and the preview of all photos on the camera will display. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for file association settings are displayed for each file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download photos on your computer, you may need the camera information about every entry. with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the photo information to be saved from the camera. a symbol indicates that the image is not yet logged in to your computer. note that with some digital cameras don't have any information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider metadata shows the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. of the image. these information are the same as in metadata sidebar from the main window of & digitised; or the image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the photos from their camera to a single album in & digitised, and we will try to check if the pictures were secure in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos you can download the default language methods of & KDE. once you select the photos, use the button to download and then select the button. the button is chosen as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, a new option is now available. these images were not yet marked by & digiarrived. in this case, the new pictures are downloaded with a star in front window. if you choose this option, only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you can download the buttons or download selected files, a dialogue with which you can select the target album, in which the photos will be stored. the list of existing albums can be found in section My Albums. select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you select the target album, press OK, and & digiarrived; downloads the photos of the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired image, you can delete this from the camera. you can delete all of it once by using the knob delete all. if you only want to delete some, then you will need to select this first and then delete the delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no possibility to restore the photos that you have deleted from the camera. so the photos are not deleted in the trleiades of & KDE; you should be carefully deleted if you want to delete it from the camera. if you want to delete the camera aspirt, you should make this about the camera bag, because this is considerably faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as a file name for the photos often not especially meaningful name. the file names are usually deleted again after the photographs were deleted from the camera. so this can be useful, the date and time when the image was made to integrate into the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for turning and spiders of the image and file-based substruts. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options while transferring three additional options to be carried out before the photos are stored on the plate. the first two affect the data via the author in the default auto identity. if you select it, the relevant entries will be copied from the Exif-information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different file format as the standard format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S. switch the option date & time. for more customization you should read the help of the command strust.</seg>
<seg id="265">When you use the camera filename, you will have the possibility to change the filename in lowercase. or in case of capital letters if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digiarrived; for a photo, is displayed below the name, which displays the camera in preview. your settings for renaming files are stored and automatically used when you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitised, you can use all the information about the orientation of the camera for recording of recording. not all cameras make this information ready. in the section side bar metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera doesn't deliver this information, you can turn off the button. if you want to turn off automatic rotation, use the button Advanced and select the automatic rotation at the lower section of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera information is available on the date, at which the photo has been made, you can download & digial. all pictures with the same date will be loaded in the same subalbum. not all cameras make this information available. in the section side bar Meta-Data, you can read what information your camera can be embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case stores & digitised; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, use the button Advanced and select the input-based subalps at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to download photos from their computer is the button to download. select upload. the file extensions dialog & KDE; appears in which you can select the files that are uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & digitised; you, where the pictures are to be uploaded. select a folder dialog box for the camera. select here the desired folder and press OK to start the uploading. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general concept in this document. this is a position that can be displayed in length and latitude. the identification of data can be performed from the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographs, it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an airplane to cartographic an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environment planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you forgot later, where exactly the photo was done, you can send a browser, which can send the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digitised, which can then locate the site of photos, it is good to enrich the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come to the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 has many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and card referrals. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the correct hardware, via editing the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to geographic mapping (manual) and last over the manual entry of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has a GPS unit integrated. but there are some who work with GPS recipients together. either as card module or via transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel, since this is the only format that is the only format supported by the module to the geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract the data of pictures and of the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script which works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the signs of arrests, such as maps.google.</seg>

<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by clicking the button updating right from each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the digitismal & digitismal font can be set on this page. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. however, the option & quot; In the whole image size ladders; if you have one, then you can get a better check results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer another color, you can select it here. you can switch the tool bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brighter colour in the picture. these colors are set here. in the image processing, this anomalimode can be switched off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Using Chroma-Subsampling is meant that the images should be coded in a higher resolution of luminance than in the colors. please read this article in Wikipedia for the next explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">Using PNG files, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not decrease the image quality, since PNG needs a lossless algorithm. if you have a quick calculator, you can put this value on a high compression. thereby 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">In combination with the TIFF files, you can turn the defending -Compressionsalgm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no influence on image quality, because the deceased -algorithm uses lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting lossless JPEG 2000 files you can save lossless loss. even if you write the loss of loss, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in the normal JPEG. as this paragraph was written, metadata was not supported yet, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digitised, the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it develops very quickly to manipulating your photos. with this dialogue you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard imitation is that all green pixels are equal. if you use this option, this difference is a bit pattern in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option records the image a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 braid pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the bald is used immediately. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the bald is not set. standard is a fixed color balance, based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD's SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that the images contained in four steps more details in the shines. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the shudder, i.e. the parts of your images that are burned-in, because of the inability of your camera shows the pointed white in the settings. the setting is created a few unusual results because they are able to reconstruct the shreels in various rosatönen. lastly, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the peak beam.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally doesn't satisfy as fast as green and red. & dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red parts from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question how many color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option you get the option you get a level. here's a value of three compromise and / can therefore be adapted for each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the luminance to your taste. you probably need to set him somewhat higher than the standard 1. but this can also be done later in the image options of & digitised; in order to keep the time for the demolition, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">An demolition algorithm is a digital imaging process to calculate a complete picture of the particles, which have many cameras and that is a Matrix colored pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color structure.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digitised; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks like this. VNG interpolation (variable number of gradient) was produced by Dcraw. however, it produces color tips on the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable outcome.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the colour deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue proofreading values here. this is certainly the best method for a color softness, as you have performed during the ecode.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions like this to be given again. there are also LCMS and & digiarrived; information such as the color information from a colour space to the other are as precisely as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions, if a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with rough files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder insert up here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you all save your profiles. & digitised; this folder will examine then during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC Profiles you have the ability & quot; default squot; for your profiles. everything can be changing to opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour administration view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here, only your pictures are not managed by the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model. not all profiles are created on the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain color mapping or Gammakorphrases. currently, dcraw Gamma is not corrected for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means you must perform the mapping yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the Soft Proof profile, with which you can emulate how to print your image from one device. this is very useful before you can print a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore may be saturated rather than leaving your printer on the blind algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it's pretty obvious that color profile for them is planned for them. unfortunately not on the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course inofficially:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profiling extension makes the style for the purpose: F for an exact style, L for Landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & KDE; image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & KDE; image viewing and image processing is supported. many modules support, which were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules, and these modules will then be downloaded from & digitised; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition, you can also see some of them in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules, can be placed in menu under Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) over KIPI modules, you can get via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugin .org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the distenau should be easy to understand. the upper regulator is adjusted the time between the captions, usually a 4-5 seconds well. the other check boxes turn the metadata and off, which are displayed at the lower end of the pictures during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera characteristics are shown on the left side a list of all the time supported cameras. on the right side there is a button automatic detection, which is trying to identify the camera. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in image mode. currently, here are serial, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have chosen a UPS or FireWire mass storage racks. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / then, indicate your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digitised, you need to connect the camera to your computer, and turn them into the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out whether & digitised; the camera automatically recognises you. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. once you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this will display cameras from the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog for relocating &gt; images in the trash dial, you can adjust the conversation of & digitised; in the deleting of a photos in an album, you'll find further details in the cut-up of a photos and deletion of an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes due to the right side bar can be shut down by & digitised; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without asking you. otherwise, you need to apply the changes with the button changes.</seg>

<seg id="335">Various color schemes can be used in & digitised, to adjust the main window to your taste. this settings can be chosen under settings design from the toolbar. a preview of available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in simple text files. if you are interested in making a new design for & digitised, you will find more information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digitised; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use this to view your photos and improve your photos and improve the image processing on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the updated ads / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digitised; so they are not part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, please refer to the image processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom edge of the window, the file name, current filename, magnifying factor, and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge and among them the toolbars for quick access to the most frequently used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">Editing functions of image processing change your photos. not the features will change the original photo before you use file Save or the button Save from the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo once you saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should then make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save with file save as possible.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not stored the photo, you can restart the original image by repeating the editing file or the button The button restore image processing resellers in the tool bar. you lose any change which you have done at the photo since last Save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually every action of image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting transitional or reproduced by editing the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make use of the keynote, Ctrl; -z for reversing and run Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you want to press the & LMB; press the toolbar for a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions are either reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation button in the toolbar, picture above or the entries in the menu file. if you have done changes in the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can get in the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the toolbar menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To attach a photo to the window size, you can automatically select this button in tool bar: magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full-Mode shows the picture in full screen mode. you will also see the toolbar. if you do not want this to change the toolbar. if you do not want this, you can call this in the installation dialog by & digitised; you can call this from the & digitised window. see the section for editing the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print in the image file image and get the default & KDE; print dialog. you can customize the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print individual pictures or whole sentences. all picture pages can be printed out of your selection. you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album exporting printing assistent. if you follow the assistant, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digitised; main window has a side bar on the right edge, which displays important information and promotions for selected pictures. the same side bar is available without the navigation parts, even in the image processing. it will be displayed if one of the five riders are clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicks on the same rider lets the sidebar appear and disappear again in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the PA view, you can insert notes with unlimited size or insert. note: the text is UTF-8 compatible. that means all the special characters are allowed to use EXIF- and IPTC- Fields that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and use special characters. if you want to use the IPTC label field in other applications, you should note these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you comments, you either use the button on users or change the next image, the protector are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user button, there is a button More. with this, you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. but you can also write the metadata to the files. this is always done if you have a metadata default always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section rating is an assessment scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorcerations. it can be used either by a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the sidebar or with the keyboard cut Ctrl + 0... 5. the evaluation from the sidebar will always be applied to one image. in order to evaluate more pictures at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written into the IPTC field. the encoding follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keyword, the keyword tree and a box with the previously used in this & digitised; - session on recited keyword.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword is adapted dynamically to the adjusted search phrase. you can quickly accumulate the number of possibilities in search of a keyword fast. this ability is especially useful if you have a lot of keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering the keyword in a picture series. if you have entered different words, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by markers of the respective check boxes in a tree. all tags of a picture are stored in the IPTC field Keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar sample filter is used to change the selection of the main window displayed. normally, the left side bar will be used with their album, date, sample and search views. if in addition, one or more keyword filter is used in the right side, only the cutting volume of these two is displayed. all words are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and dismantled. if the keyword already exists, you can easily go from the right side bar and put on the selection. then a dialog box you will ask if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the pictures on a calender date. the keyword filter is reduced to no keyword, which was reduced to three images. they were drawn with Ctrl + a, and afterwards, a keyword from the right hand-tree is drawn up and placed there. a dialog asks if this keyword is supposed to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">These search for changes will take place at any start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and discover that it should be one or be, you can easily change it with a double-click on the text and control.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry that is searched for in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that has already been placed in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define an extended search on all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free storage place is limited to 1 GB, and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / Tutorial was written primarily by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have mostly adapted to & digitised; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a colorless workflow. you can get a predictable deviation from your camera or scanners. you can print out the colors on your monitor via your camera or scanner and that you print or in the web, which correspond to them from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes to color management, then everyone wants to press the buttons that he wants to push for the results. unfortunately, the sense of this tutorials will allow you to provide sufficient background information about color management. in addition, links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions to make you the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your photo workflows fulfilled every six below, then you must not take care of the file management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB colour space. (see further information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Their only other images are via e-mail or web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB does so well, and life for everyone is so easy, why should you use another color space and have to make thoughts about color spoils?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB in comparison to the colours that we really can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colours that can see, the hufeather-shaped region, and the colours in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger colour brows, so visit Bruce Lindner's excellent site and then click on Info and then on Information About RGB Working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to calibrate my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you're working on the sRGB-color space or not, you need to monitor your monitor on sRGB. if you are working as a color space of sRGB, then you must either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functionality normalize, balance, automatic and contrast expand from the menu, automatic correction will automatically try to make the best of your colors. they will be experimenting with these effects, to see which works best at your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaling leukemia values above the entire image, so that the darkest point black and the brightest point as bright as possible will change without its color shaded. this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">In the same way: this method is adjusted the illuminating element of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of intensity of the image is as flat as possible. sometimes, the comparing very good results in improving the contrast of a picture, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles with a painting or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. they determines the dark and light border tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels onto the entire histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast Expand: this method improves the contrast and the luminance of the RGB values of a picture by postpone of the lowest and highest values in between the highest possible range and a new jiusement of all values in between. this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The bald head of & digitised, is a semi-automated tool to perform the bald-like photographs.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-like correction is slightly restricted because of a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you can do so far from the original picture, areas with oversize can occur in the 16-bit mode, allowing you to improve your possibilities to correcting better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance sheet by Pawel T. Jochym protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it via the menu entry colors white levelling the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The front window can be adapted inside the size. on the left hand, both the original image as well as the preview of the goal look. the preview will be dynamic as well as the preview of the tool. if you want to see the original whitish immediately, it's enough to click on the window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red markers. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right above, a histogram is shown that dynamic changes will change when you have a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixel can choose very small luminance levels. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your total is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your score depends on shade, saturation and gamma. shadow Adjustment lets you improve the shading details of your photos or also dimming down.</seg>
<seg id="401">With the above-mentioned checks, you should use the colour temperature pipette. press on this button and afterwards somewhere on the picture preview to use the color of the color temperature of the white balance. this type will also set the temperature and green values automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the bald immediately with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The oversize indicator increases the colors, when more than a colour channel of pixels is overexposed. this will display the combined result in the white balance. this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and store are exactly this. every attitude of the white balance you have set to store with a text file and load later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button preferences reset all the filtration values back to their default values and the matching white balance. note that also neutral settings a different photo than your original will be submitted. if you store this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the code depth per colour channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is better for high quality images. however, this encoding requires more record space, calculus and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog like the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour mapping can be performed by the underwindow for the helligations. detailed instructions for use of color profiles can draw the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu below colors tone correction. this tool provides a built-in way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner can always make the same mistakes and you can always find the same correcting. in the manual for tape correction, you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colours Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digitised; tool colour aspects provide you four colour defects, a solar system effect, a bicycle effect and an edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing was Solarisation, also called Sabatier, a effect that was developed if one was partially developed under pressure a short flash light and afterwards the effect of the image was inverted. this tool was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar isation. at approx. 50% intensity the picture shows which chemical is possible. another increase is finally a negative image that is not to be installed on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar panel. the original image is (1) and the processes (2). the applied intensity is about 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter is simulated the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; Effect. it differs from a saturation that it makes a more powerful contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. simply try to embellish many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an optimized colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. however, the characteristics make it a few photographs, especially those who have little landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter is simulated on the contrasts. parameter Level controls the brightness of result and the shift repeats the strength of the neonlight. in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and luminance of your photos with the tools in the menu. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo in bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to view it. all changes you can do in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tools Gradation and the simple Leuphstarch / contrast / Gamma is the tool of clay-correction to improve exposure. even if the dialogue is very complicated, you need only the range of slider. specifically the three slips below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or of the selected area. under the graph three slips into the inside are clicked and the postponed can change to change the intensity of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the regulator, and make sure how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. preview can be updated dynamically, using the settings of the image, updated on the left side are the following options available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box can be displayed if the histogram is shown using a linear or logarithmic Y-axis. in pictures the large areas of a constant colour is often dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logical histogram of a single pillar is dominated. in this case the logarithmic division is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the top for dark tones, the middle for the bright sounds and the bottom for the middle sounds, often called Gammah.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinball can be used in the preview of the original image, to adjust the input values of shadows, medium and bright sounds automatically. moreover, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each range. there are also two controls which can be used, for example, the output values can be used, for example, to create a booked image as background, while something else in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: this button will automatically be set automatically depending on the intensity of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Store as and loading: using these buttons the set values in the file system can be saved and later recharged. to do this, Gimp is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and select three color pipettes, the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shadows, resources and sun sets. enable the color pipette to set you up and click on the preview of the original image for Red, Green, Blue and Luminanzcanals.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option resupply indicator provides all color channels to display overexposed pixels, and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below, you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and Alpha Channel, and the output values are unchanged. the original picture is with (1) and the corrected picture (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the original and the target image is shown. a preview of your settings will be updated dynamically. on the right hand side options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification channel: this selective box allows to specify the channel which is altered by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Besides this switch, two symbols are located to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. mostly linear mode has been used. in this case, linear mode produces a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode provides a wide beam.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, e.g. the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds may be darker, corresponding to the image of the pixels.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red markings to see. if you move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve, which is the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Store as and store: with these buttons you can do exactly this. every bend you can created can be saved with this file system and later, the file format is the Gimp Currformat.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three colour pipettes -buttons automatically create the controls of the curve for all channels of the shadow, Central and Sonnentöne. enable the color pipette to set you up and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curves.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option reviewing angle indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixel. if in more than a channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that has been corrected at the luminance channel. shadow and Sundays was applied to the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the correct (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer in & digitised; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels, or change the colour shading of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another high-developed tool to mix color shades of images. you can edit it from the menu images channel blender of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">Selecting the channel selection box you can select the colour for the histogram: this gives you a first note how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left area of the window is shown to you a preview. the original can be viewed as a comparison to your own riders.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target picture has a red markers. if you position this in the picture, a vertical line appears in the histogram to display the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: regulator for red, green and build it will allow you to change these channels only if you are also able to activate the corresponding video components. this is especially convenient if you can also reduce the option monochrome when the channel mixer is to generate your photos. try to reduce the green immersion for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color appears to a visible smoke that doesn't appear on the same place in the color canal and it looks different in any channel. if that is the case you can improve your Monochrome conversion, which allows you to reduce the colouring first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The stores as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any audio setting allows you to save and then download. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option resupply indicator provides all color channels to display overexposed pixels, and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below, you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re-adjusted. the Luminance option is activated. the original image is under (1) and the processed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white-photography was always fascinating about your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a working step, because paint images can simply be converted to the machine. also with a set of film rollers.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filters. this looks good, with all scenarios and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange-filtered: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens. this improves landscapes, marine, and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) Orante.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filters. this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate Moonlians at the time of day. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) RotFilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow linear filter. this is the natural color of color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm light and medium sounds while it adds a bit of cold into the shadow-tones. this is very similar to the process of leaking a pressure and re-development in a sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digitised; tool texture can use decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, an pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a wall painting on a wall. the menu entry image and image processing can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter after the right increases the impression of the depth and the three-dimensional texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper texture effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and that changed (2). the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">Powered by & digitised; tool frame can be added to a decorative frame around one image.</seg>
<seg id="462">To keep the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photos is not easy task. a possibility to keep its attention is to put the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under picture frame, the module can be started from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you adjust the desired size of frame for your image. piercing the image with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-white pictures), cut it with a nice three-dimensional frame of the ideal for a buck effect and decoratively adds a decorative frame with pattern.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: width of frame rate in percent. the value for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This goal is larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio is larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the pictures, especially if you use the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple a large-format text to any location in any location. this also goes to several places when you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use textual direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its qualities as you need. the bigger the image, the larger the character set. finally, select an frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Every attitude that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you hit the button "OK" after the image is saved once, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">Using the & digitised; tool template can apply a template via a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template can be used in image processing can be used to create templates.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template, there are no restrictions on the size and the orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file format and should also add to the file size of the template. if you want to add your template into the template; please send an e-mail in English to the & digiarrived; Mailing list digiarrived-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">When you use this tool for the first time you will need to select your stencil template with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder you can copy the template. you'll notice these settings for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder was set for stencils, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template's folder. the selection of a folder will be updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview three buttons are available with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button increases the displayed image. it is centred around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button shrinks the image below. it is centred around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole image, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to postpone the image below the template. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Please use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adapted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digitised; sets three different tool for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpened is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very quick and simple, but produces particularly in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpened mask works on the contrast of the edges to look up a picture. actually, it is not a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunes and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and he is copyright protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refokusze is probably the best of the three because he really improves the sharpness. it's a little complicated in its application and has various parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalised pictures need a correction of sharpness. these elements are smaller than the resolution, so that sharp edges can be printed together with only minimal differences. the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras require more retroactive sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG image, a camera has been widely applied to internal sharpness. images in the base format, however, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners are sending a sharpening device during the image of the image. if you disable this deactivating, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening device node. this allows you to correct the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">They should hereby be careful, because the results are not very natural: sharpening raises the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the useful technique increases the tool refus.It will achieve further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution that image a little soft to draw is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool for a soft mark using the menu entry. this window display shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Filter is a very good tool to remove veils of your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview can help you edit the picture. the window display shows the output of the movie with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values produce good results and should first be tried. an increase of radius or amount increases the effect. if you make the unshark mask to be strong, noise and impression of grats close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is like a lot of pixels on each side of a channel by the filter. high resolution images allow larger radials. they should therefore sharpen pictures at best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage of the original and the knowledgeable image is added to the original. thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling is a rupture of the maximum RGB-value and the difference. you can thus define a minimum difference in this way for a cannon of filters. in this way, areas with a soft change between killing of sharper and therefore flaw is avoided in faces, heavens and water surface areas.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unrepetitive filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). insharp masked with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a corporal value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitised; tool reocusability refocussed a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to prevent a painting on & quot; refocussing quot; in which the traditional technique is used as only to try the photo. Refokusades is usually achieved better results than insharp masked. you can launch it from the menu by arousing colors refusing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding is much better than the Gauß's Find. the Gauß's Funding has a very long tail, which also leads to the mathematical result from the source pixel. the FIR Vienna Inverse is influenced by the original pixel. the FIR Vienna Inverse is influenced by far away pixels. that causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular division. it is the most important parameter for use of this module. for most images, the default value should set 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very unsharp, but should pay attention to Heiligenvouchers.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter may help you reduce artifacts. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, and eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0,03. a high value is added to the image even further.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter if your unsharpness of Gauss is caused. in most cases, use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you need a value zero, you may need to increase the correlation and / oderden.</seg>
<seg id="503">Match size: this value determines the size of transformation matrix. an increase in the size matrix can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The stores as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any refusal parameter values are set to be stored for later and then can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the cutting, color and intensity correction on the image before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that many surgeries are not immediately visible, but left uncomfortable artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read pictures and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed picture.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp mask produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by this, which uses insharp masked a larger neighborhood as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it must produce insharp mask. even under optimum conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharpness. for the Wiener filters it can never be the effect of the optimal linear filters. practical is the result of the FIR Vienna Filters always at least as good as the inox mask. the FIR Vienna filter is often better when editing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between different fillet, on a small unfocused picture, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unclear colour picture has to be corrected. this picture has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods for sharpening error in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob is the sharpened of the range of darkened, to create a more natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour tinte allows a adapted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the most advanced tool to remove non-use artifacts with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The inventive algorithm has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as strong points to simplify the restoration. the default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab smoothing, and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed gaining p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to a smooth glass of the image. a smaller value leads to a smooth glass place over the image. a value of 0.9 should keep details so that no sharpening is necessary. please note that the detailed accounting should always be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Breakdown dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly across all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you produce a film grain or CCD noise, we produce a high-wave pattern. JPEG artefacts will be best out at a value in the vicinity of 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this makes the maximum smoothing factor of allotp then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value as suitable for the degree of space in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is concerned more structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoother, because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: there is often an algorithm to pass through. usually here is 1 or 2 out of the algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular stepping width da [5, 90]: angle dependant integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is small, there should also be small. be sure to create small angles for a long time. so, you should choose this value as much as possible and unacceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step range [0,1, 10]: integral step-wide in pixels. you should avoid the value smaller than 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation Use: the More an quality that you receive through choice of this option is only low. he doubles the duration. we recommend it therefore.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and loading are exactly this. any setup of image errors can be saved in a text file and then reloaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Frame errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, however, it can last a long time and move a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob knob.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below, you can see as picture errors fixed with small artifacts. the module is used on a photo that has been made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see, there is a unique black artifact that caused by a bad film storage during the trip. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitised, smoking production is a very powerful tool to decrease sculpting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides a selectable image filter to remove spots and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moirevocation; -effects of eincluded images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensors of digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot picture above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy, which can be removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the underwindow advanced settings can remain in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, of 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter per pixel is needed, and the color in it is geared towards the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus slightly smaller flaws.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the depth distance. this value sets the pixel distance from the filter to front. if it is increased, noise tips will be deleted if you need to change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer receive and robbery or lubricate.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the accuracy of the edge for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response. if it is too strong cannot be removed or robbertips may occur. put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak space or JPEG artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend you change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process of the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the colour tolerance of the image. we recommend you change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process of the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically stronger, however, it tolerates the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of the phylenjitterdamping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts on the luminance of luminance. if it is increased to a minimum, noise and phasenjitter may appear at the edges. it can remove space tips and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and store: these buttons are used precisely for this. all parameters are stored for smoking production, which you have to be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how smoking production can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and corrected (2). the noise was applied to standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution that image a little soft to draw is much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool for a soft mark using the menu entry. the window display shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digiarrived; Photo restoring is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photoartefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesired artifacts about your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauss's, film grain, scratches, compressive images and local errors that takes place along the frame and maintains the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and textures. the texture is carried out with another tool, the image errors that was developed. algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannum and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a loss of losers, it produces some compression & quot; Artefactequot; - small standards that are in uncompressed picture. this attitude shall correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and store are exactly this. every attitude of photo restoring can be saved in a text file and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoring is comparatively very fast at work. however, it may take a long time and move a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button closure.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below, you can reduce like a photo with tie-shaped smoke. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (TM) 700Si camera to a Ilford (TM) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces. the original image is under (1) and corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures can be found on an old color photo that has been read with a scanner. you can see the scan-artifacts that have been viewed from scannerlighting and photopapier. the original image is under (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiarrived; tool Hotpixel allows you to remove Hotpixel of photos that were taken with a CCD camera, eight were used. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Light, dead or hot pixels are particularly high quality raw materials, as many cameras have a built-in suppression with JPEG compression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark picture subtracting method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark image. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel. these are highlighted in the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to explore the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD's defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the right dark picture to the correct image. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel. note that the assistant remembers the last dark picture and recharges this automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image range and the preview can help you correct the result inside the image. the projection window shows the output of the filters with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all pre-looking areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the movie. select the best filter method to interpolishing this pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durcut: an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined. it is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels have a distance of 1 from the pixel block to interpolate the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim).</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixels block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (1-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim).</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn, to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixel.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hot pixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitised; Vignettic-correction is a tool to correct the Vignetation, i.e. underground corners to correct a picture.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often lit up the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignettquot; (shaded) they can reach the corners and edges of the image, by reducing the light to the sensor there. TeleObjective show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has drawbacks. many center-filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the BlendenFilter, which should be impossible to keep the camera with hand. wide angle lens should use, also with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, otherwise unsharpening effects caused by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">It is possible to simulate the effect of an Centerfilter by current filters and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of an Centerfilter by emulated a equivalent of a Centerfilter. the tool is protected by a Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three shelves, you can control the Vignettic-correction filter, and with three more exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light strength absorption at the point of the greatest density the filters. the standard density is 2.0, which allows an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly to compensate the density to compensate for a greater degree of Vignetation, you reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuphstarch, Contrast and Gamma -Settings: the Edit of a picture with the Vignettic-correction reduces the exposure of the target image with these options. the regulator represent you only positive values, as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want to adjust the exposure of exposure of the target image, so let the values for luminance / contrast / Gamma in zero and use the gradation from the & digiarrived; image processing from the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignettic correction cture to a picture. the original image (1) shows the correct image in the corners and (2) the corrected picture was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digitised; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses in photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colour distortion can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The second order is treated with the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but laughs at the edges. these correction is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the coefficient corrected the remote vertices to the second-degree. if you combine these two can be eliminated almost any geometrical distortion.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the thickness of the distortion of the second order. with negative values, tons-shaped distortion can be corrected and positive values hovertically distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion of the fourth degree. this value seems stronger in the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'corners' parameters are the inverted sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value is scaled down the image size, thereby enabling a correction of first grade. negative values can increase while positive the image.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten: this value adjust brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values improve it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialogue with a preview the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be stored and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tons or cushion correction should be carried out prior to all inflow or size changes. best result you execute these correction as all first. if you have a picture of new and then a ton-shaped correction would be the effect of the False.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction to you, this tool provides a vertical and horizontal relief line. move it to an important place, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place. in the connection you can correct the k / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you have a cushion distortion, the resulting picture will have black corners. you can transize this with the cutting tool in the menu, cut out of image processing or about the zoom in this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tonne-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motifs such as recordings from the front, frame and paintings, it's the perspective so correct to correct all the angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that when you keep the camera with hand, you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the k-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infra-red film from the Gimport guru.org website which is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (TM) SFX200 infrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the range for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can look at the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can simulate two parameters of film liquor and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controls changes the amount of film liquor and dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filters color channels are mixed to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the colors are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared profile definition applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the machined picture under (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the shank.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digitised; Filetry is an easy to use tool to reproduce film liqueurs on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to enhance the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers of great silver chairs in the photoemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film management efficiency gives your photo a certain atmosphere, or seems to move back into the past. if you want to get rid of this special, gallery-like, road photographic, grained sight especially in your monochrome photos, so you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, if you need more grains, so you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film effect on a black / white picture. the original image is the (1) and that used the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digitised; filter oil paintings produces the appearance of an oil painting. it is used by a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digitised; Filter Oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance, like an oil painting. nature pictures and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the top chooses the brush size between one and five. thick brush is better suited for large images. flatten the glasses or, from the other side view, the chars.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and that worked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel wide picture is 1 and Glorious 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digitised; filters carbon drawing uses color and intensity gradient to define a coal plant. therefore, pictures of their gradients are slowly changing for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch you. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the top regulator does the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast (gloscope).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon drawing filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result may be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digitised; filter engraving is your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digitised; filter engraving is a quick tool to give your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the picture into a gray, monumental landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">Depth allows contrast to the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the modified image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by decomposing effects. it is used by copyright protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: share the image in cells and look it as if it is viewed by glassblocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the waves 1, the image will be distorted here with another version of glass pieces.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time for calculating and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects anytime with the button closure.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using unsharpened effects. it is used to copyright protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Utilize: get the image along sternable lines that go out at the center. this simulates the sharpness of a zooming camera and generates a dynamic expression of often seen in the sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial unsharpness: get the image through rotation of the pixel. this simulates the sharpened of a turning camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distances: wither the image to create a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to be back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement of motion: widefies the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photograph, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softener motions: get the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or to add a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Archers: wirelates the image through random delay of pixels and simulates the insistence of a arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent unsharpness: finds the color-basins in the image and wipe them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: share the photo in rectangular cells and then created it, through the colt with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time for calculating and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button closure.</seg>
<seg id="624">The drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops onto your picture. this makes it natural your pictures a wet appearance. it uses a protected algorithm used by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drop size allows to change the size of drips. since the tropical size is not automatically grown with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small pictures. number changes the number and density of drops. fish impacts change the optical effect of the drop in the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold with the & digitised; image processing a area free of shelves. use the tool to select the area, e.g. a face that will remain free. if you then start the filter Regentropfen the area will remain free of shelves.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regindrops Filters. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the machined picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, so you can bring it by mirroring or turning into the right direction. the tools can be found in the menu, transformers, and transformers.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to create a photo by a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to shrink is simple. the big question is, how can you find out a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you find the missing information again? how can you find the missing information here or guess? the Cimg algorithm used here is a good job. try it and you'll see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it on the desired size with the tool size. select transformation size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is visible below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to shock the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool for inflating.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a type of interpolation, such as Spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digitised, uses a further developed approach. the based algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You have to tell the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the size ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is concerned more structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoother, because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons save as and loading will be used precisely. any insert for photo. can be saved as text file and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very quick at what it does, but it can still take a long time and move a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button closure.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see an example for photo inflating, by a small color image to the double size increased. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the Preview (2) is the result of the linear standard penis enhancement.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photos is not only a common operation, but also a common underestimated tool to put together a picture. the mouse simply allows you to create a picture with the mouse, pressing the mouse button and tightening the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while moving the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you remove the mouse button, the territory of the photos will be cut off. this allows you to change a good overview of your photo following the cut. you can create the size of the cutting edge by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. you can create a new rectangle using the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut-up, use the button A knob button of the image processing in the tool bar and the photo will be cut (Ctrl; + X). use the file to save or file storing in the menu file to save the newly added photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the forefront, you can change the size of the rectangle by postpone the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio, which you defined in the dialog remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in the high format, the larger value of height and the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool for aspect ratio is used. this means that it is always equal to use regardless of whether you use centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you can see, for example, a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue, two buttons exist for selecting the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below, you can set the Max. relationship button to the range for cutting in the highest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool for aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are using the cutting tool the next time, these settings will be stored as default values in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data will reflect the pre-cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of coaster help allow help to blinding her images better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonious parts are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-rule, harmonic triangles a possibility to divide a rectangle in a similar harmonic triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden middle is a dividing to different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus mussel or the petals of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we find as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used to build your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations to provide a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number leads from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is 1: 1,618 the golden center. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides liquefied auxiliary lines if you put together a picture. these assistance will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirals will get good results for your photos. compared to third-rule the golden spiral produces a liquid line of the eye through the image. this kind of composition takes the view of the viewer along the line of spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule are the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles to create the golden spiral. it should be something that the eye can be put into the centre of composition. this can just be a line or different objects. this one can just be there without the eye, it will fulfill his task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles also glimpse from the above-mentioned golden spiral. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, gold triangles are no equisily triangles. diagonal to walk to this lines can leave a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, create a effect of professional photographer dynamic symmetry. try your image focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonious parts.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the colour of the auxiliary lines. if you have a painting with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. this type allows you to adjust the colour of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it's easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things turned around an angle. select this with the & digiarrived; image processing and tool free rotation. select transformation free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the button preferences you can reset the slider again to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image will be displayed right above.</seg>
<seg id="664">To help your help, the free rotation is a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointing to the two lines. after you move it over an important point of the picture, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle like in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After turning a picture you'll find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to repair it is to use the function transformers from processing operations.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic cut. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing smoothes the picture a bit after the rotation. but please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectivical transformations are carried out by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. preview can then be calculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog box you will find some information which will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas formed by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas that are formed by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Corner left: shows the actual angle of the transformed territory to the upper left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right: shows the actual angle of the transformed territory to the upper right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left: shows the actual angle of the transformed territory to the lower left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: shows the actual angle of the transformed territory to the lower right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the image becomes a bit dirty. for a single adaptation this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double-strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective, you get unjoyful triangular holes at the corners. one possibility to transfer this, it is the picture with transformation of transformation into the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool tool is used to postpone part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. this is not turning the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part left. this is not turning into a parallelogram. you can launch this module via transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Check your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can set horizontally and vertically. when you press presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of Effective will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target picture will be displayed right from the front section.</seg>
<seg id="680">To help your help become a vertical and horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After completing the recovery, the image becomes a little bit wisely. this effect is usually negligible, but two deposits eradicated twice as much as possible and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After finishing the picture, the image has unbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. there is a possibility to eliminate this, it is the picture of transformation cutting from the image processing.</seg>

<seg id="813">Select the pictures you want to correlate to the main window and call the menu. the above-looking dialog appears. to load a possible correlation between time and localization. this file contains, of course, data from the time to the same locations, as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded, an automatic correlation was performed by the coordinates in red. GPS data will be recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera's time is converted with GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set up your camera zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">Setting for the maximal period deviation is a top variance for the GPS period and camera. the deviation among them are merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have a description of a place for pictures you can manually edit the GPX file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all the pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have any appropriate data. if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can put these limits here and hit the button related to interpolishing.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place. since the dialog can use the coordinates of a call to the next, you only need to set the button OK to put the data on the current photo.</seg>

<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums and HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums up to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded with UTF-8 to enable a best internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can choose to be exported to HTML. you need these albums only. the albums will not select hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area, the Albenpreview and the text of the HTML page will appear in the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab look defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this rider is largely self-explanatory. if you click on a picture, a new page will be displayed in the image. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard viewer, & eg; KuickShow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored in all your images. select a folder with the name KIPIHTMLexport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">In case you select the JPEG file format, the EXIF information stored in their original images are also stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the default color depth. the file size naturally influences the file size. all other settings are explained even explained.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider preconception allows you to watch some of the settings from the album rider for viewing images, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user to how far the action is. press downfall to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has generated the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program reports to indicate whether errors occur during the creation. the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the preview of the gallery. press shooting down the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as scripts, zooming or shifting. the viewer can be used with short sleeves and Must. it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>

<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG - free module is a tool to change images without impacting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to save the actions listed below, save images in JPEG format, without the usual losses to quality and metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage, it is the file size, since no compression of the color information is taking place. for example, you can find the PNG format again.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool that you can connect to your computer with a digital camera.</seg>

<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another. select the image of file extensions with which you want to copy the set-up dialog, so the image you want to copy the metadata. the data are copied after the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported in writing. please look at exiv2, to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in form of a slide.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual pictures you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are scaled automatically on the correct size for the chosen video format. in addition, you can create a background color for the Diaschau. with this module, it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the media you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First, you need to select the images that are supposed to be packed into MPEG Diaschau. afterwards, you can create more than Extras MPEG Diaschau to create the module.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures selected by you are then listed under image files. there you can also change the images or content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should choose the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to select the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most probably choose the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that will specify a picture. the speed of image output is defined among them. a low value generates very sudden, a high contrast, smooth screen change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background colour can be set next. in doubt, you should leave them black. in doubt, you should set the name and the path of the generated file, you can define the name of the mpeg output file as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, this will be integrated into the film. once you can add all settings to the film, you can now drink a coffee and enjoy a coffee and enjoy the digestau if you're back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that Kodierer or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the button settings.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printing assistant is allowed to print multiple images on a paper-printed paper. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the Gimp of Gimp. this is useful to print you or print with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">Using this KIPI module you can import / convert your files stored in the RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw of Dave Coffin. a original quote from Him is: expect from dcraw not to get the same results like the software from your camera makers. sometimes you get better results with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file to be converted and restart the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the button preview, you can look at the effect of your current settings.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values for the conversion process to optimize the conversion process. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can process the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and only the extension is adjusted, and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a loss of lossary algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">In case you are frequently asked to edit your images or later, you should not choose the JPEG format, as there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata will be stored in the RAW file in the JPEG file in Exif-Information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings you can restart the conversion button. if you want to cancel this process, you can use the break down.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking mode allows you to convert different images to one time. use this mode therefore if you are sure, e.g. through testing on a single image which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite the file automatically. however, this is helpful if this has been created in an earlier attempt. a preview of progress is not available as far the conversion is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all pictures in an album. it uses the program in the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all pictures of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album should be used.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection. it is using the product program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce the image and enlarge. in addition, four types of image changes are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. width or height of the image will be automatically, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 diam.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to match your image format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: non-proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed in this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: prepares the photo for the photo pressure. the user can adjust the pressure resolution and the size of photopiers. the target picture, including background size, edge size and background colour, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the added images previously. more pictures can move to the list of traced images and lay down there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After having started the module, the pictures window with the selected images will be displayed. you can add more pictures on the knob. for the most viewed images, a preview can be displayed on the right page.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag pictures to the picture list and to add it to the list of leading images.</seg>
<seg id="875">The button images will remove the selected pictures from the list of a few pictures removed.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you select all images, you can open the new message to your e-mail clients with the button OK. you just need to add the addresses and the subject. you'll have added the pictures added as Annex.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not pay attention to many pictures at once. most E-Mail accounts have limitations for the size of multiple e-mails. it's possibly a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the pictures. your configuration is stored and each time is used again until you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you have to specify in the input field below the right path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you have to install the GMailAgent on your computer before. you can download this here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting the comments in an attached file, comments are added to the images in a text file and added the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to use the size of photofiles, e.g. TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a quick internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under Pictures file format and select the original files in JPEG format, the original exit data will be added to senate pictures.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be automatically closed with the search for errors, you can view. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end. with the button shot, you can shutter this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau, a window with questions such as you want to have shown your Diaschau. you can choose between you selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-transitions option in the presentation activates very elegant hints using OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The file filename indicates that the file name of the images are displayed in the left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option allows you to display the presentation in an endless loop. you can immediately break it manually with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly choose to see that the images are displayed in a random order. so it's not the order of the pictures used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Delays between the pictures can be set at temporal distance between the individual pictures. 1500 miseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect. you should be able to show this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. randomly choose any transition between the pictures and another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide you can access a toolbar on the top of the screen. move the mouse to this corner to switch you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can start the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left bottom of the screen, you can see the current filenames, the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date is currently no documentation. if you are interested in writing, please contact the Mailing list of the KIPI Teams under KDE-imaging @ kde.org. attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to put a picture of the background image for the working interface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module uses the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of submenus, as a background for your KDE work surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have made your pictures and videos with notes, you can see with & kphotoalbums; see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the picture, you are now in every group, so in people, places and in group words present entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information as you have put your pictures and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course the current role models. in the following, each is described for itself.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse to the entry, the view of the Browsers changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images are displayed on which both persons are visible. through this selection method, you can limit the number of images shown by a few thousand images to a few single pictures.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected every person, places and other settings, you can view images to watch the images of your response.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of its name. you can save with & kphotoalbums; however, for each person you can store your own image, which is of course also for places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself. see also the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To display images next to the names, select the button on the right outside on the toolbar. in the present context menu you can select which you have to view for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can view icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keyword (if you have no suitable pictures).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you need to define the image for each individual person. in order to view this, you'll need to select the image editing window (in closer) and select the picture menu to select the appropriate person. in the click window, you can customize the magnifying factor according to your wishes, and then select which part of the image should be displayed and cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you're looking for searching in the main window, you will see a dialogue showing the dialog for the Specifying Image Features very similar. this dialogue allows you to view the image again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you want to enter a string in the field labeling or description, you can also enter a date and descriptions of the pictures in this text, so for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all pictures on certain names as you can see in the picture. here, on which Jesper, however, are not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user guide for & kphotoalbums;. if you don't like to read books, but rather want to try to test features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & on photoalbum; and watch the quick setup, screen photos and insert videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Run & kphotoalbum; and select in the first dialog the demo, if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry on the menu entry card. then, some sample images are loaded and you can try the features of & kphotoalbums; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as an associated HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom edge of the main square of & kphotoalbums; see the timeline. a picture of this surrounds you can see here:. as the name suggests, this surrounds will show you data statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The bar can display several different time units. each loan then shows another unit. you can switch between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you see a part of a database by showing the only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be interactive on the following ways: you can select the displayed entries Preview from the database (if you select a date, the first image will display this date in preview-To-preview) and also indicates the current date of the currently displayed images, if you navigate in preview-view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the bar, i.e. the time data. if you select a range, you'll only display images of this period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& Cphotoalbums; provides you with two options available to create HTML pages with your pictures. the one is integrated in & photo album; integrated and the other as module available (see). in the following part of the user book, the integrated version is described, which you can create over the HTML menu.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you need to use some settings. these are divided into three areas of content, layout and target. in the following, every area is accurately described.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the surviving and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on the photo album; HTML-example pages you can see an example of this settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; -export file is supposed to be seen on the oversight. see information on the export files you will find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last, you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed. by this way, you can avoid that information on the HTML pages are obvious. for example, all pictures of a party are obvious. now, note that & kphotoalbums; currently all pictures are exported. therefore, you cannot use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain considerations.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most of the setup possibilities are clear, so it is not specifically received.</seg>
<seg id="923">On the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for images. this allows those to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no pictures download, for example, to have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer on your side can change the resolution at any time you have set up. so he can browse your pictures with low resolution, as well as if he wants to get a picture larger, he changes to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this installation area, place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select for all your HTML files a base folder and for each successive sentence a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and next time. this way you can select for all future pictures to the location. here you can select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if these really are all visible for viewing. if you have created a web browser, after the pages have been created, the URL that you can set here should be this folder. otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not in the final destination file, you need to copy them manually. so the import function, see, properly, you need to specify the final destination of files. this is not the subfolder of current files, but the base folder in which all subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="930">The precisely described one-level setting offers all three on basic ordner or URLs. in these, a subfolder was created, whose name can define it in output file.</seg>
<seg id="931">In case you are on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere different, with other users of & kphotoalbums; come together, you might want to create your pictures with this share. however, if you have already picked up a lot of time to view the pictures, receptionist, etc. then you have to do with & kphotoalbums; this work is not even able to do.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbums; you can import a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. you can import others in your database. the image properties are made with precise and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ if the images itself are stored in the file, or if it's only a link to images, that you have all the pictures together and enter this file so independent. the obvious downside is however the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the menu file Export... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file is looking for the images to two times. first, it is searching for images that have indicated in the file of the .kim file. if the images are not found, the images are displayed if you have created your .kim file through the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following will describe dialogue for exporting images, which you can export to the Export menu (Export...).</seg>
<seg id="937">The main option of this dialogue is whether it is supposed to take an internal or external .kim file, the following three selection options are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">If Manually, to copy the .kim file, you will need to copy the pictures in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the automatic option to copy the .kim file, copy & edit images, copy the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most of the images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file is very small, it usually doesn't get the files to compress. if you wish to do this, simply select the export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum size limit. if you send your friends pictures, you want to limit the images maybe not in full size, as the .kim file would be very large. here you can limit the size by, for example, that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and broad.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you want to import a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file... select & select photoalbums; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to import consists of four steps. first you need to select which pictures you want to import, then, in which folders needs to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you can personalise the category people to import file personer (if you are a Dane), while this category is called upon your database people. therefore, you will be imported in the third dialogue window, which are to be imported in the third dialogue window, and which categories correspond to these in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compensate the categories of impacting file with the categories of your current database. an example of this you can see on the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse images and watch images: if you look at pictures, you often want to view images of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend, you might want to see all pictures on which this friend is depicted, see.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will take the different steps from (1) to provide information about your images, about (2) the looking and prestige, up to (3) advanced themes and adaptations.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program for managing your pictures. but it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos. many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often these videos also include videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photo album; saves all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their pictures. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g., Normal safety tools, copy on a floppy or revisions in the CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& Cphotoalbums; remember the folder in which your images are stored and used this at future starts automatically. if you want to read another database with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu entry Settings menu, set up... enter a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbums; in the following section of the user guide you will be explained to various setup possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you see six different symbols, with which you can call the options of preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, an exhaustive assistance is available, which you can access the F1 button and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described as you can create different characteristics for each image, such as persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">To view the dialog, which is used to process already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a labeling and symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the dialog options, you can set up complete assembly groups, i.e., for example, all members of a group at once in a group rather than explained in a group instead of each group.</seg>
<seg id="956">In seeing the installation options, which are available to you for fixed member groups. you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window of the window, you can find a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& photo album; share its module with other graphics applications, such as digitiam and Gwenview. this modulation system is called KIPI and means & KDE; image plugin interface. please find information on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called upon the menu modules. the modules can and are not described in this manual because they are not part of & kphotoalbums; however, most modules have a help page you can call on the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of multiple applications can be used together, it may be that the modules used with & kphotoalbums; you can only test new modules at first with the demo-database with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu help. do not say, I have not warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules above KIPI are very different, making it possible for some modules with & kphotoalbums; not function. this is the disadvantage, if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbums; and other applications that are also using KIPI is an album simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbums; this type of order is not supported, it simulates the order for albums so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbums.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which is just the current opinion, so all the images that are currently viewing the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album & kphotoalbum, the modules have to be handed over to a list of albums. here goes & the photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & for photoalbums; S browser shows the contents of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it is the category that you've specified in the installation dialog as category for virtual albums, for example, if you are using the Category people, it will be & kphotoalbum; so, if you have selected persons on the view and to pass the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbums; not compatible, you can remove these from the list of modules. just start the installation dialog, and select the module modules, which are to be loaded modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen when you run & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see the window with which you can browse your photo database. at the moment, it does not contain a lot of information about your pictures. in the section we'll show you some information about your pictures, but now click on the record images that shows you an overview of all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoalbums; is the opportunity to see any image with notes on the picture, where the image was recorded, etc. you can put any image either individually or for a larger number of images, at the same time. if you are depicted on all images of Jesper and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes may be used for searching and browses, as you can read in the section. if you want to see these notes, if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In watch three lists with a text box by setting up people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbums; because you are always using it again if you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is relocating the pictures within the list: if you are shown for example a family party and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons can be shown, so that the names are moved to above, which can find people faster and arrange.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to receive a alphabetical list, click the symbol for sorting on date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you select annotations for each image individually, you may have to view all selected images and have images covered with notes. in this case, simply click on the front and back buttons that are located below the preview of the picture on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu option multiple entries once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. besides, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an overgroup. to show you that it is a transitional sign, will be a special symbol.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory. in addition, you can also put an entry into a category and place there to order this to a subcategory of this entry. attention, this requires you to alphabetical order of your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can postpone the individual elements of the brochure dialogue, click and postpone the boxes of the frame, click and move. you can also make a separate window by setting off outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs, you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button options..., which allows you to save the current assembly and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also leave a frame fully automatically. if you want to display this window later again, use the button options... and then click on the button. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select some images in the browser, you will receive an overview of preview pictures of the currently selected pictures, or of all images, if you don't have a filter. an example here you can see here. you can configure the size of the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. simply try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you leave a picture in the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this picture is displayed in the picture viewer. if you have not opened any window with a picture viewer, a new display window is created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the corresponding pictures you want to delete and select either the removing key or select the menu Edit. now you can see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& Cphotoalbums; you can also use a solution for this problem. you can also use the pictures stored on the hard disk. of course, you need to download the pictures somewhere so that & kphotoalbums; you can see the view of & kphotoalbums; in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbums; if not all necessary pictures of the hard drive can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures in which the right corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for example 5-9, the images are available, giving you the preview of these pictures. you can't watch the preview of these pictures. however, you can't watch these pictures with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see this feature, you need to copy files from the folders and copy it again. & Cphotoalbums; so it does not support you to avoid the insertion of the relevant CD. if you want to avoid anger, how to prevent your images in question, please purchase a larger hard drive to save all the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images, you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that you can see for other unlocking and click on the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also see all pictures that can see your little sister, contour and select the menu entry Everything except in current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">Thus, you have set what images should be hidden in the case of your little sister, simply select the menu entry pictures, making all the pictures you blocked, hidden. if you want to check the pictures again, click lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password to unlock the pictures. to establish this password, select your password in your privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this image protection is not certain if you can access the file index.xml, read or delete the password as unencrypted text, or delete it. this type of password protection is only used to convert those with & kphotoalbums; not very familiar to the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to describe all your pictures with & kphotoalbums; administer and hours about hours to describe it is of course that you want to look at some point. for this reason & kphotoalbum. this is why you can start a picture _ and video viewing. this is how you can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. of course it shows the picture, but additional all the information you have to enter about the picture, e.g. who is on the image, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox is on the upper part of the picture you want to see, so you can drag this simply with the mouse and if any information is displayed. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer. then you can see the context menu (see below).</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all images of Anne Helene. as if you were selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have several pictures in the viewer you can switch between them and go back by using the keys picture high and picture down. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and the end. these functions are also reachable from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">When several pictures are loaded in the viewer you can run this as Diaschau. & kphotoalbum; then invites you to press a new picture after a few seconds. how often it loads a new picture can be checked by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus the trashore by buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer from & kphotoalbums; it is used in full screen mode. in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. simply use the entry button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you can use the viewer you can use in the image and out it out. with the mouse you can easily pull out a rectangle. with the Minus button you can slide out the Plus button zoomt in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom-rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the Point button, you can reset your zoom, so the image is not zoomed. with the reclamentation, the zooms sets the zooms so that every pixel is equivalent to a pixel aspect of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zooming operations are working with videos that are in and out with the Plus- and Mint paste.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the functions from the context menu, you can turn the picture. this doesn't work with videos. you can make comments on the current image with the menu option from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures you can find a picture of a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture. in the moment you can view the viewing and configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you'll notice the image to mark and see further pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper. to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad, while you are one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above gives you the opportunity to view pictures with traits while you watch them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature by setting the corresponding letters. see a picture where the characteristics A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your images, you can see them in your browser. so if you select all pictures you've chosen, print or whatever you choose, so you can use a module to copy the selected pictures to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and particularly features can be displayed in forefront view. if you display categories in Dre front view, then you can press features to the pictures, just press the letter for the feature, after the image was selected. you can see here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. this case allows you to paint & kphotoalbum; paint on the image.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The old man is not stored with the image, but in the database. on the way you can make your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In a picture you can see a painting on the painting. in order to paint the painting from the context menu, select the image from the context menu. to end the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar above on the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovant; work, you need to control the application of the program & Povray; not fully-controlled but the documentation about & Povray; you should have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object characteristics and the object in the wire-modell- views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select several objects simultaneously, but not the object of a selected object, as all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position when you want to add the object and select either the symbol in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are more difficult positions, the following foldable menu will appear, so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">You can choose from the menu bar, either from the menu bar or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed features, click Apply to adopt these changes. if you have invalid values, a message is corrected with an error description. then you can read the input error and re-use the changes with refuse.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed property.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this property. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you are editing a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview of your personal view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press on preview in the concept-view and a small sample of the scene is selected with the chosen item, even if you want a subordinated element, even if you want to rendering a part of texture (for example, a texture within a texture-map and not the whole texture map), cross locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points and it will appear a small cross in the open-scale view. this cross marks the centre for scaling and turning as well as the position for shifts. you can change the displacement by pulling with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visual press model. you can only specify this value relative to the higher level of the higher object or as absolute value. objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visible level smaller or equal in the toolbar of the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpoveder; has a window arrangement as default. the object-tree and the view of the object characteristics are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the default window, or if you need another arrangement, you can easily set them anywhere. you can also store multiple window orders and switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window on or under any view, drag the angle to the top or bottom edge of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the collection to the right or left side of a view. the new view is anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on each other, drag the angle to another view. you can then switch between the views of clicking on the menu pops up in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangements are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchoring place, drag the angle to the desktop or click on the small upward pointing arrow in the collection bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the collection bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the menu view, you will find entries for any kind of views. new views are narrowed, you can anchor them at any location.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with window rules... save. it will display a dialog where you can save the window arrangements under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can rendering them. & kpoveder; used & Povray; 3.1g to rendering, this program has been installed correctly. as this manual is written, & Povray; 3.5. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeling; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the symbol rendering the symbol rendering in the toolbar or select the menu view of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">An Render-mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to renew a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you may insert many Render modes, from a quick preview of up to full quality images.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the symbol The Render ® with the toolbar or in the menu view Render Modi... the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render-mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that can be seen in the mode of mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card size, you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render a small area of the image, choose the check box and enter the image output to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination of quality, you can select the properties that uses & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection lighting. an exhaustive description of the Render properties find in the user guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is printed with a beam of pixels, different mistakes can be created. these images often have a moirè pattern or stage effects in bends and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of this defect. in general pictures look better with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than a beam of pixels. this technique is super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adapted because each pixel is adaptive, recursively, because each pixel is always divided again and adaptive because the recursioning depth depends on the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray is a beam of pixels. if you adjust the default value of pixels with super sampling, both pixels will be calculated using a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you calculate the lowest value of pixels, a grid of 4x4 is calculated with an extra value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for Red, Green and Blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference is divided between the colour values, the pixels is divided into 4 sub-pixel, which will be individually persecuted and set to further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you switch Jittering, it changes & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular samples.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card card you can adjust if the alpha-channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the matching beams does not hit an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for viewing the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason for this here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; to import scene, select the file entry file... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovModer; not the full command-range of & Povray;. if, when importing error messages or warnings, a dialogue window shows a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovant; you want to import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to import the source code for & Povray; to import objects into the text file editor. to import objects into the scene, mark the source text editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and paste in & kpoveder; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray order is called if & kpoveder; a scene is rendering. usually this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the help in your own view, opens & kpoveder; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed property. place here the path to your document and the version. supports the versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example alups) to the & Povray; -libraries. if you enter files that are not in the folder, you must also apply the path to these files here. if a file is used in different pleads, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire-type models. the second color is used for the display of selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for viewing the selected inspection points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type label.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can adjust the points of the points on the buttons in the context menu of the wire-related views. you can adjust the grid separately for shifts, scaling and turnouts.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values provide a better wire model and thus a better approach to the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects such as the ball you can adjust the detailed level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high fine detail for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall becomes mounted behind the objects. the wall becomes displayed in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross ground, a ground is covered below the objects. the bottom is shown in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you cross the checkpoints, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. values for depth and swelling can be adjusted. more accurately, you can find in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can change existing window arrangements or create new window orders. in the window arrangements, you can create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination field standard window arrangement: shows all existing window orders. & kpoveder; used the selected window arrangements at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of pre-hand window orders displays all existing window arrangements. a new arrangement allows you to add button, and delete a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Any window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views of the selected window arrangements. new views can be set with the button Add and delete selected views with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column, you can create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with unts, you get a map view view together with the previous view and webbing enshrined the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpoveder; installed and now you would like to start with more accurate knowledge of both programs. if you want to follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate, simple scene, very popular among beginners: one ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings, before you complain about it, you should only receive a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not adjust the camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you can get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything faultless installed, you will see the first start of & kpoveder; the following pre-configured window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and the symbols of the toolbar. read the documentation, so you can get an appropriate performance of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will have to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpoveder; start with a simple scene. to follow this manual, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. mark the scene and then select the menu entry. so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire view shows how the camera sees all the scene that you create. in particular note that in the fourth wire view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the viewpoint of the camera. this shows you the result of the Renderns scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera. if you click on it, see the contents of the view properties, in which the different parameters of the camera will find. in the user documentation about & Povray; you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing at the basic settings of the camera, this is later instructions reserved, but note that the camera can change in the view of the camera, with which you can change the target point of the camera, just click on a control point and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you push the button on users or the ONE GABETASTE, the wire model views and the object is immediately according to these settings. as a result, they look here the scene from the viewpoint of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you might add a string (insert endable body quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a variable method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpoveder; indeed offers a simpler possibility. you can use an infinite plane as soil:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the object in the object tree, change the name and then press the button on users or the ONE. in the object tree, the new name will appear immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view shows the level now, although at the moment only a limited endary level. if you render the scene, the plane extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can click on the object + in front of the object. in this case, you will see the various parameters of the object. in this case, you will see the various parameters of the object. in this case, you will see the various parameters for each new object: scaling, turning and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should shift the ground to exercise a unit below the horizontal line, just allow you to know some of these parameters. select shift, and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Just select the ground to insert its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog, in which you can select how the object should be inserted. you can then change the property in the property section (name = ground pigment), with a click on the button preview, you can see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of Pigments only shows a black material because you have to enter settings for the pigment yet. therefore, remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. also, there are many possibilities for this, but now take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on Quader and ball in the preview, click on the button users and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is right now. if you use your image now with a click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course you are not the color scheme. here are another settings needed. in the color list you must use two new attributes (you can also use this entry twice (you can do this also more frequently, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, choose each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step you should already be able to perform, as you have seen the basic work of & kpoveder; the ball can be just as easy as to create the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget INGABETASTE or to press the button) so that the sphere would float above the floor, as you have postponed the floor around a unit after the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering is now a strange result: as already seen before, the ball appears like a Mattes black material. put in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you choose the ball you can point a material right now. as already in the floor, give the sphere a pigment as colour:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select your own object and change the name for example in the pigment. click on the pigment, then select insert and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on users or press SINGABETASTE.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The atrophy effect and reflection makes already some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: not yet selected is:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of having the possibilities you & kpoveder, offering. hopefully, you've already learned something you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you rafting a scene raytracing, the renderer hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders scenes) by every pixel in the scene. the ring is calculated as this beam appears to effect the visual effects of light sources in the scene and like atmospheric effects, such as nebula.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see no camera without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you look at the scene. without a light source, you can see nothing, the image is simply black. obviously, every scene is supposed to be taken, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in standard file dialog, you can select a file that you have previously prepared with & kpovmodeling; created</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and a storage space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Imagine the scene in the last stored version. all changes have been discarded since last storage.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can only select this menu item, if you haven't stored any changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reversed command. this menu entry, you can only select if you have processor feedback.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Save the current window arrangement and opens a dialogue in which you enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you will find options for the setting of & kpovant;, here you can change the look, the key shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Open a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can modify this option default for & kpovmodeling; change commands or add new.</seg>

<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to make rough surfaces without having to model any hives on the surface and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a bump-map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometrical forms that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture-map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel-based, by applying a picture file as a colour map.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& ball show; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser, where you can choose pictures to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window at the size of the image or screen mode.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP-interface of Amarok has many general functions, which are mostly mentioned in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and should describe the DCOP functions of collection, context-browser, player, playlist, playlists browser and scripts. a sample call for the DCOP-function break may be & zb; look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command-line options of Qt and & KDE; in addition, Amarok still has some own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check your script if all the necessary modules are present and use dialog to make users know why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Korundum' Rescue error = 'corundum (KDE binding) from kdebindings v3.4 is Required for this script.' 'dialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In scripts / template, you will find a lot of Template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as a base for your own scripts or simply expand the required functions. you will quickly find that writing of scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP you can exchange your scripts to Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which should lie in every KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow the execute of external programs and commands. in this way, dcop &gt; can be accessed. this way, dcop &gt; is relatively easy to be called. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; send notifications to all current scripts. for this reason, scripts should continuously monitor their standard entry and react to events. of course, a script may ignore the events if there is no use for this.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weak is the script to preview the dialog box. to store the store and loading of the setup data each script must take care of each script. if a script is started, Amarok sets the folder on the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signal that a new piece is played. the script might now be & zb; with DCOP-functions further information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newvolume signals a change of volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customizing the script to the selected files of playlist, if a user-defined menu entry may also be used, so that the script can use the clicked entry. to remove one entry you can use dcop amarok script remove.MenuItem (submenu itemp).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok; or if the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do so, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that can be compressed by a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar-archives (.tar), which can be optionally compressed with bzip2 (.bz2), which can optionally be seen as Amarokscript.tar.bz2, so that the user can recognize the archive clearly as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will only accept the script packages using the extension amarokscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packages like correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main thing is to be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameters -p to obtain the file's rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is finished, you can download it on www.kde-apps.org and follow the link to the wiki script page by & amarok; app. for your entry on KDE-apps you should use the category amarok; scripts.</seg>

<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many others & KDE; applications also equipped with a & DCOP; -interface. with the help of this interface, parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can use either the command-line program dcop, or that's a bit more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the functionallity, so rather your taste and the type of your tasks are crucial, which will give the help of the programs.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use command-line program dcop. to use the & DCOP; functions you have to make sure that & k3b is started. then give something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the General & DCOP; functions that have all & KDE; program have in common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts that are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP-interface of & k3b; features functions such as copyCD, formatDVD and further functions to create new projects.</seg>

<seg id="1492">Therefore, it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders, and then insert files into the new folder:</seg>

<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other coders have already been installed. however, all these programs are usually not necessary to compile something itself. but if FLAC is not used, the installation is not necessary.</seg>

<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coders and compression rates and helps you in choosing the right Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to go lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other like 'shorts' or 'monkey' which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices can use these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, you lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate the differences are less important because both coders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame will still be included with most distributions free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up very high quality quality (at high bitrates), but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality at deeper bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG files are present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto-stereo systems. today - beginning 2009 - support these devices only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting yields good transparency to most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and something less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approx. 5.5. requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR, stereo stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music by adolescents, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insulane '= 320kbps CBR. this attitude will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that will be entered manually or by the program automatically from the freeDB program, are available as a list of parameters. you can be delivered / used with & kaudioCreator; and the code program to create folder and file names, as well as the features of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with Kodierals there is often a combination of program settings for the coders and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the code readers explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, add the & CD; title to the keyword (English: day) if MP3s are coded with lame, the switch -tt is to be added by lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -d {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which people can read / enter the information up / enter, so that all the other information can be downloaded from yourself into the calculator. it is to note that here only from text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; however, no more or less valuable, so the information can be added to the music company any more or less, so any information can be obtained from the music company via a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; it is actively to choose a cross-box (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address can't be used when calling the server (This can only know the programmer who has reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & audiocreator; for use of freeDB, the geographic on the next floor mirror server will be needed. this saves bandwidth on the network and compares the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current listing of Spiegelservern for online retrieval & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (generally monthly) only the upgrades of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which book program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files to my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There is rumors that cdparanoia will be used, search in the source code.... This was always the best choice for the reading of audio cd;. to note is that the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed, if this is not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the printed WAV files, the Kodierer can be chosen and thus the desired file format. in the first opening are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab. other coders can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the Kodierer can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined Kodierer. more information about Kodiers are in the chapter world coders.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodierers you can obtain more information about his switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; Console). must 'lame' will be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">That can have a lot of causes. check the device configuration of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and read and whether both cdparanoia and the audio coders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;) are installed. try both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could give a hint on what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the cover of the CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, do this tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, everything understood, but are somehow still uncertain what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that you want to let the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and use our first & CD; read '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as compiled packages for your linux distribution. an appropriate package for lame can be found as a non-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files that you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory consists and that you have write permission (eg; by trying to copy something into the conversation).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section handles the basic set of & kaudiocreator;, something probably is done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read out an & CD, which must be repeated for any editing & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the using coders for compression of music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) and the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program with the freeDB to download the & CD; data from the Internet download.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Even though we can change these settings at any time, we are probably not able to change it with any & CD; change when the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device designation is delivered to the selection program to read the & CD; data / pieces can read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom a symbolic link to the real device model of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The signature map General Settings. here you can't do much to do. here, an additional conversion cannot be defined. in our example, everything will be loaded / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only if you want to ask for incomplete information, so that you will be informed if data are missing (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and release the & CD; data automatically via the internet of a freeDB machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected during the reading & CD; it can be connected to the internet, so that it can access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selective field is simpler, a & CD; entry found, starts immediately the reading & CD;. this is slightly satisfied with the database entry and the enlisted directory names / filename or tag entries, can be easily changed. der directories and filename will be changed with contact- &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & KDE; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">In addition to this example, if you want to set everything manually, turn the select fields and freeDB is not used. however, this is about 620 MB big, consider this twice as it is worthwhile. to freeDB in the offset mode, the two selection fields have to be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the map card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freeDB. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freeDB server about the internet. how does the system know which data the disc should get? read the section about freeDB. do everything like it is shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with remote database on the internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freedb.org site and look for a mirror server in your vicinity. on this way the burden is distributed between the machines. however, this attitude will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, but there are many firewalls the protocol 8880 standardly bockle, there is maybe more happiness with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surf in the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to transfer any & CD; data to the freeDB server. the first check box should be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the file / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: sorry, is there a reason why more than one at the same time at only one existing drive? parallel reading and encode? the author knows it not, therefore simply try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; check out the last piece: cross this in around the & CD; throwing at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you cross this, then the path / folders cannot be stored in which the wav files are stored. if only space is available on another drive. if the field is not checked, the files will not be created in a private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything you enter as it is on the screen. the command is somewhat long, under circumstances, something must be blinded to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, it is sufficient for very good audio-quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is sufficient for example 224 to 256 kpbs. it reached a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the tags' --id3v1-only 'for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V1.1.' ID3v2 'tags can also be deleted if required. Kidney is an excellent' id3 'Tagger for & KDE; in case a later modification of the tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest like in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of parallel WAV files: at a dualcore or quadrucore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than a wav file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we have just finished the basic set of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as a standard for each output of a & CD; used. if you have chosen the organisation structure of your music, you will never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section, described as the process of reading the & CD; on the hard drive, we will create MP3 files. first, a connection to the internet is established, as we are convenient and the & CD; data from the freeDB will want to pick up. the process of this section is described in this section, must be repeated for each outsourced & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we have a & CD, which is not included in freeDB, see the screen photos a bit different than the data for a & CD; with successful of freeDB defoed data. therefore you will learn the & CD; data manually, instead of retrieving them from the Internet. comments are point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is to find out. it is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, the & CD now has to be defined in the drive, which was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screen. this is only if the CD; the audio CD can be identified and by cdparanoia can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not happening then you are looking for questions and answers to the assistance, or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the disc has been collected from freeDB, all titles of the pieces are already filled out, and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; gives a window appears, and you can select the database entry, which your opinion is best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have chosen the check box for the automatic query of freeDB (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the Settings), you can also redeem it manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have any local database, but take data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD editor - entry of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Specify the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'Update title', the rest of the data in the 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist does not have to be entered in the "Current Title ', unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidivents per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments, common to all the pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful call of data from freeDB, the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor, so that you can not only start with the artist and album names (e.g. whether all words begin with big letters or not...), but also to verify if there are any undesired remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field. if you have ID3v2 tags; maximum allowed. this option is set up on the code tab. take a look at the section called 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with him you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all codiers or file formats. see Help for the Kodierer to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select one entry, which is obvious with the style of the chosen disc. in this example, this is not important because we don't transmit the & CD; for more information, go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second one.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you can see that the fields for the album has already been filled with the entered data we've collected for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the items of the current piece. the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and process the same way until you have entered all the titles of the & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from freeDB. it is already sorted in one of these categories of database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. note that the artist and the album will be shown above the denominations.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before each line of a piece. just the titles that are selected are read. just a simple click on the line will select the selection of the piece, or select the button all tracks on the bottom edge of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the button selection of reading the reading process, this window appears on confirmation. click OK and then we will have a look at the window with the entries and follow what is running out.</seg>

<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and betting the button shutdown in the tool bar, select the entry bottling from the menu item or enter the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts when you draw it on the & kmid window. (in several pieces it will be added to a collection and then played each other.)</seg>

<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can adjust which events are supposed to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically calculated that you have to set nothing manually. so, if you select anything manually, the karaoke text is selected, but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other kind.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up an event type, select the Settings menu or push-ups from the menu settings. the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you summarise. these will be played in the turn. in this section, how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. here you will find in the menu Collection below the item... Click on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can adjust the bundled in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">Into the temporary collection, all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not stored. remember when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there, you can add a song using the button. again, again the file dialog, with which you can choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song, depends on the adjustment Automatically add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic add to the collection is enabled, a piece will be added to the active collection using the opening file (open or drag & drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically add to the collection is not enabled, the opening of a piece is activated and cleared. this collection will then be added to the open pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and select the desired song and then click.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the sequence in which the songs will be played. if you select the series from the lower menu sequence of the menus, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it at the collection manager, or use the select list on karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump one song, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu, or press the button arrow right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To get the vice versa a song, select the button foregoing piece, record previous piece from the menu, or press the button arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the delete collection and click on the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, that doesn't matter, since it is not stored at the leaving & kmid; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is necessarily necessary for synthesizers that are not General MIDI-capable. in this case MIDI-Map General-MIDI events in events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map, which converts all events of the Change Herpatch to Bright Piano in events of type Change patch to trumpet and therefore always sound a trumpet when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a soundcard, you don't need MIDI-map because all sound cards GM are compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI maps. so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all required adjustments for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear so often as desired. however, is that every occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of the keymap"... END Define KEYMAP "A further keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section begins (except for options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as email, so I in future versions of & kmid; support can offer for devices that are not General MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, as the patches of General MIDI is illustrated on your specific keyboard, the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation will ignore. it is believed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you can't change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all the sounds that supports this instrument on the clay with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a drum (e.g. with tone 60), which can be like a thread. do the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant to form a different percussionist instrument (drum, pelvis, maracas & etc;), and not the one that means the sound height of the always same drum (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify how sounds are illustrated on a certain channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">Like at PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you must only use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to form sounds on the wiper channel. check out as an example the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to exert some channels to others. if you want to change the first and second channel, make it quite simply in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered between 0 to 15, constructed according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is displayed on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap will be used for this channel. if you are using the Forcepatch option, all events will be ignored, which try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, the patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example, to always use the wiper patch on the percolder canal.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates, in which proportion of Pitch-Bender events will be multiplied and then the value is to be forwarded to the formula n * (r / 4096), and then the value of 4096 is used to be no decimal (in the map file).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This attitude will be used because GM proposed that a keyboard, which is a Pitch-Bender Event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, try to play some keyboards up to a octave above. in order to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The Kanalview is a window with a whole series of piano (one for each MIDI channel). you can see what sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the edge view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument, the button doesn't light green but red to show that no longer is the original instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (up to now) has two different views to show the played sounds. view the Settings menu under the Point Kanalview: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace-LCD displays speed, with which a song is played. the higher the number, the higher the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. so, for example, you can find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows on the left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc. thus, the same MIDI file can result in two different devices, as well as two different musicians can play the same scores in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have the control of everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary (rpm, deb) from & kmid; that has happened because & kmid; without AWE support was compiled. to remove the problem, you need to download and install a source of source (for example from kmid; 's home).</seg>
<seg id="1686">I would like to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Understand, therefore supports & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & Konqueror;, select all files, and drag it to the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, activate the automatic adjustment to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can switch the arrow key to the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the default tempo you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have been open on one & KDE; -Desktop with my MIDI folder and & kmid; in this mode, if I want to play a karaoke file, or I'm going to play a file, only into the & Konqueror; -window to change and select the desired file into the window of & kmid; draw.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file quickly, without adding it to a collection, turn off automatic Add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection. open files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let us assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first, you only want to play the first file. so, set the adjustment Automatically Add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection contains exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you disconnect to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. all heartfelt thanks! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, animated me on & kmid; to program.</seg>

<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you want a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write an email: larpink @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make a huge anticipation when you send me a postcard from your home or a Midi- / karaoke file from a local group. if you want to send a postcard or a MIDI file, if you want to send a MIDI file, you should contact me because I already have the file.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, as the sound quality depends on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use an FM device or an AWE card.</seg>

<seg id="1714">All changes are lost if the edit mode leave or another group is selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched on by modifying the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modify [General Options] No intro = 0 obtaining option to '1'. if the option is not available, it can easily be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate a different animation. & kmplayer; share the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / introdplayer / exm.xml. the format must be an supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during the starting doesn't need to be short, it will be automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be troublesome at the end of animation. however, the user can end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the ads of a favorite photos; & lt; & lt; & lt; IMG dur = "instruct" src = "file: / / / home; & lt; / bodyguards; In the source package of & kmplayer; included in the tests testing / some examples of SMIL the by & kmplayer; supported.</seg>

<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only use Xvideo, it should also be supported on the first screen (: 0.0). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension has to be functioning as well. for the XFree86 server it is necessary to use the XFree86 server in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

<seg id="1753">The quick-entry assistant of & kile; is a handy feature for the quick creation of a document in & kile; the selection of the document (menu) offers some options for the creation of the document. there are also some of the document related settings.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this will discuss the type of document document: article (article), Book [book], Cover [Report], Articles (DIN) [scrartcl], Report (DIN) [scrreprt], Report (DIN) [scrreprt], Collection [Prosper] or Custom.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: this is used the character encoding. it should be used to use UTF-8 encoding as standard. in the best, UTF-8 should be used (for correct processing of latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used add-packages for the latex; for the integration, they can only be selected in the check box.</seg>

<seg id="1759">& kile; offers - as well as other sources of source editors - the highlighting of the commands, settings and elements (as well as the unmatching). through & kile; it is easy to check out areas of a grassy text. however, it will be noticed by the modest appearance of the output file nevertheless, however, it will save you through the highlighting time and the times.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic translation of environments, when using a new command (e.g.\\) {command}) by & kile; automatically creates an empty line (for entering the text) and the appropriate line to connect the command (e.g.\\\ 'command}). this function may be disabled in the menu settings; setup... LaTeX commands can be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are divided into some elements. & latex; the subdivision of the document in the following elements (part is the most common and subduous element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structural view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the setup.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating the own & latex; files can be helpful very helpful. once a DVI; file is created, jumps & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI; -viewer on the respective row in the latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the format document and also other information such as the font, and also other information such as the font and is available next to PDF, to view, conversion and printing of DVI; files for various systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the cable search, the elements of the DVI; file can be clicked onto a element in the DVI; -file, the exact opposite is the exact opposite of it. once upon a section in the latex; source code is made, it is injected to the appropriate part in DVI; -viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used in working with multiple files. using a Master document, work is simplified using other integrated .tex files. when using a project, a project-wide Master document can be set up to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick installation: the latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if no error in the source code are displayed).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File over this mode: in this mode the DVI; file on the so-called "well-wired" and there is no call of & eyepiece; after fast-construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">In consideration of the editing toolbar, the three growers should be developed. the selection fields were developed for the quick setup of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... the adjustable & latex; commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selective field for further information is available for items such as: tags, fugues, notes and references. the options of the options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command is created for a section, a picture or a different element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Connection: is used for reference to a fixed name (choose a select box).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote is displayed a select list with literary entries. at & BibTex; files are required only if the file is necessary to use a project. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & BibTex; files can also be written in & kile; written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last radio box with the name of GrÃ ¶ m will be used for the configuration of the font. it can be specified for the main text, the fugues notes etc. there are the following fonts for reference:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two selection options are available: 1. the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document art and procession settings. 2. the document can be written by reason.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets according to the\\ 'class contain the settings for the command. the code [12pt] specifies the font size. the font is not set at the beginning, it can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code has been entered, the latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way is to use the menu or the Knopfs quick design.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored in front of the compile. & cile; for storing the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document fails, should be searched in the logging of errors. when using quick-construction, the eyepiece should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English. environment) is a text that is different when the remaining document is treated. for example, a report with the font size shall be created and only a few south exposure should have a different font size within the environment:\\ Huge and\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ UGH).</seg>
<seg id="1781">External factors are controlled only within the environment (by\\) {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there are no restrictions (number) for foreign exchange within a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities for viewing the readability and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, grease pressure, cursive printing, substings, etc., may end with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ '{emph}: this command is for the cursive pressure and is long as long as possible until it will be closed with a\\ end {empih} or another environment. a single word in a set can be represented with\\ emph {word} italic.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ '{quota} and ends with\\ end {quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source code with the latex; sign language is presented, now a step-for-step instructions for the creation of a document in & kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the wizard a bit text is entered, some adjustments for the document should be accomplished. to this, mind. a quote, a few places in fat and cursive printing and a poem to use to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, an editor-view or Ctrl e can be returned to the editor (internal viewer). on an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been printed, the document can be printed or printed into an & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a remote file format (engl. D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi's Edition such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF Converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file, the same steps as for the creation of the document can be printed (see). by clicking on DVI, the document can be printed out using file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar illustrates the conversion of DVI; file in other formats. once the DVI; file from the latex; source code was created, the conversion can begin to put other formats using the PFE in the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The pre-looking approach gives the direct jump from the editor to an additional position inside the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; -binary files. this only works Modern under Settings Kile set up... tools are going to be balanced.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To execute the pretense search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a row of the source code and clamped on preliminary search. the jump to the appropriate place in DVI; -viewer is then done so.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this feature in & eyepiece; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document of & kile; pitted and to the respective line. this must be set & kile; in & eyepiece; set up as text editor (setup eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If using a quick introduction of the & DVI; viewers are not able to use a mistake. if an error should be displayed, this will be displayed in the logging file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file is added to the source source in the source code. in the editor, the loader file will always be used in the errors file. to view the faulty line, it must be clicked on the error in the logging and quile; jumps on the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once you clicked on the relevant button in the tool bar, a window to the selection of the used template for the document is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting empty document, a document can be written either from the ground or the assistant to the quick creation of a new document. more information is included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">External user of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates in & kile; created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file size or file can be created. & kile; can create a new template via an existing document and selecting file template from document.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document, a presentation through file New are replaced by some character strings by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in settings... settings in general.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating the template's own template, it is necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string will be replaced by the input in document class. typically it will be used as:\\ 'class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the assistants and that related entries in the editor. once the document has been created, the following steps has been accomplished:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can choose your own template instead of the standard plot.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created. will create a simple way to creating a template should be searched after one on the Internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kisile; used & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting of many different types of text files (including & latex; and & BibTex;). many settings for & Kate; can be made directly out of the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate; and to learn about his friends, the manual is to be drawn up to Kate. users of & kile; let's start working directly with reading the chapter by & Kate's reading.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be called for the use of LaTeX-reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; usage as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with the finished trl button to compensate the tex; this means that in this way, clicking the\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\).</seg>
<seg id="1812">When pulling the text with penetrated linker mouse button, the balanced text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys, some parts of the source code can be balanced in the editing window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the capability to browse the various types of source texts and emphasize these. for example, the latex; commands from normal text and mathematical formulas differ by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants like to look up your own jumps within the text. this springstamp is emphasized or the corresponding key stamp, so that it is also emphasized at the first input of a character automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The processor is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like & kile; though & Kate; already offers excellent opportunity to write in & deile; important functions for the letter of a latex; source code for their selection. under processor check, the following commands include text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">If a complete section (group of lines containing on both sides contain a blank line). this extended meaning can not include a text with continuous lines, and latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only leaning matter in & kile; is that the drop is separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">If the word is stored under the current cursor position. this command also has an extended meaning, as this command is also latex; -commands with a ratio (\\) and an additional star (*) mounted towards the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For example, a section of the document can be removed out of this first place. & Kate; offers the key code Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & kisile; provides with own instruction for a faster application. under edit, the following commands include the text of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Remove a complete section. the definition for a sales in & kile; is included in the description of processing equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clear that environments is a central role in & latex; therefore, & kile; for further orders under Edit surroundings for an endless simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command is injected at the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly before the command to prepare the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command is injected at the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly behind the command to close the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is found before or within the\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 's) is injected to the end of the surrounding area (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">In the input of many wasted ambient commands can quickly be lost. this command conclude that the closing environment will not be dismantled.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the latex; groups that are determined by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands, which correspond to the processing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command is injected to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly before the fitting clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command is injected to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly behind the welded closed bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor lies before or behind the broken clamp of a & tex, group # is injected to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">In the entry of many wasted groups brackets can be lost quickly to the open view. this order closed the last group, so that the grounded structure of the & tex; groups are not divided.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple trials are used as GÃ ¼ r. for the purpose of purpose is used in & kile; the sign 'for two easy opening lines is used. also for the end of the beginning, the character is used. & kile; knows this case and for two closing arguments for the latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry into the double touch sign can be set up under Settings... LaTeX - and then exit.</seg>
<seg id="1833">There are also important settings (e.g. wet or French) and that in order to either be used German or French. there are also many other languages.</seg>
<seg id="1834">In the Drinking of Shift; SIGABETASTE stands for a smart line breaks. in the case the current position is located within a lists of environment (e.g. line-rate or itemize), there is not only a line breaks, but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">In a tables environment close tow & kile; the current line with\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligently enough to undercut voke & latex; - or custom environments. these can be set up under settings; setting up the LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users know the columns into tables environments and all the Et characters (amp;) to each other. if this Tabulator is trying to be exiled in the displayed tabulator. although this tabulator is not the addition to the appropriate tabulator, in some space for the columns position of the current tabulators.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Though & Kate; already offers good source code completion, it was extended in & kile; in order to set special commands (mostly for the latex; it is suitable for different modes). all these modes are suitable for automatic deflection. all these modes are set up under settings calile... adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment with the command\\ '{Surroundings} is & cile; automatically add the\\ end {surrounding area} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the rack button, the last letter of typing is removed and would be like to be a complete list. on the other hand, the list can also reduce the list by typing a further letters also.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions will be found in a selection of a command. alternatively, jump to these positions by editing the NÃ ¼ st jumps is possible and the desired parameter then can be folded.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under settings calile; set up... kile; check out settings for these lists. there are various weather lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as visitors of the general language used to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not required for the completion of environments. on the other hand, a few letters with\\ 'will be entered and the call of the complete mode is often used. on the other hand, the environments are often used that & kile; a special mode for the completion of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the complete edit mode or the keyboard player Alt + Shift key space, the command will automatically be folded and it appears\\ '. afterwards, the ambient temperature can be continued in the easiest way and will stop by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">After this is accomplished, the environment will be closed automatically. once & kile; recognizes that it is a lists of lists, even a first\\ item command is named.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under settings calile; set up... kile; check settings for these lists. this mode uses the wake list of complete mode for & tex; - and latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& kile; lists custom lists of abdication, which will be replaced immediately by lacked strings. the lists can be set up under settings. the file example.cwl, in which the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, the code L is entered and the word edit mode is managed, or the title edit Ctrl + Alt space bar, the letter L is replaced by the\\ LaTeX character chain.</seg>

<seg id="2053">For example, I want a fast possibility to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as the separator support the groupings. someone who does not know my toolbar will believe that the & Konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by setting all symbols, to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the correct folder. after NeueXML does not exist, it will be stored in the correct folder. please customize your & descriptionrc; so that their tool bar will be loaded (s) if a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable expansion of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation to the script language or the formatting language that you like to like. therefore, this chapter, how I create a & PHP; document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you might check in & quantaplus; -Repository if anyone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create a existing documentation for the formatterics / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. first, let us handle the second part we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc you = pfad, relative to this file, for example, php42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentary Section 1 = No. 1.html, 2 = Socialist 2.html-1 = tag.html-2 = daily 2.html-3 = tag3.html-3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the document tree. for example, you can see in the & PHP; documentation such a thing:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc you = php42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP User Table of Contents = Inclux.html Getting Started = Introduction,... Introduction = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = long-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. that shows that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the chess televisions (except through the reason) mdash; but try it out.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the contents may be referenced directly on a file (and consequently, at the top end of the tree view & mdash; file is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do nothing, but watch out & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; - based & quantaplus; Resourcendateries are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The section section is the area of the docrc file, which is intended for the gesture of context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContamList) and file binding.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of balanced context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily store your file docrc / doc or $KDEDIR / share / share / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / quanta / doc / doc / quanta / doc / doc / quanta / doc / doc / quanta / doc / doc / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / share / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / share / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / share / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / share / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / share / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / share / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / share / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / share / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / share / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / share / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / share / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / share / quanta</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are well and worth being shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation were used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud of being involved in the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to divide the separating resources (DTEP packages, tool bar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or anything else. at different places there is an email sending menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, toolbar toolbar with email, in context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripting tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download and only be made available when our team needs them as correct and used for the release. to make a useful contribution, we recommend the source of resources guaranteed, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading the Passphrase is required for their private GPG key (the Passphrase is not stored), or in the event that you have several keys to pass through the input fields. (URL preview can remain empty) and then click OK.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Upload from the DTD DTD package (DTEP) menus, upload toolbars, and can also be started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, yet before the installation, examines & quantaplus; in the case of problems, it and it can then be broken. please note the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is signed, a message appears with the specialization of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not supported by & quantaplus; it can be supported but time-consuming because hundreds of tag files can be needed in everyday XML format. there is the easiest way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and Converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with DTD description that should be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Objective name: newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Definitive line: the string that will appear in the DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">The conversion of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, release & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand these and full benefit from & quantaplus; this chapter tries to get involved with these fundamental concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; to bring little benefits to them.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the work area has divided into three areas: global, locally and projects. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; it is available in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure actions and patterns in the global tree, which will then be available to anyone in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements provide a personal collection of web development agent for a single user. these are user specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. it can be everything from & CSS; -patterns until tool-like with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply said that this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, making the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorwindow, the Baumanners, the Karteireites with information and toolbars. please beat in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on how to get a context menu with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document, such as close the current, other or all the boxes, jump or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS command to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the EditorArea Guide to another context menu, how basic editing steps (cut / copy / insert), editing under the mouse pointing device or open the file, if the string is called by the mouse pointing one file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the Editorfensters there are the toolbar of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional is shown, for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of toolbar. in the course of further expansion of toolbar, the toolbar will be adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if they want to insert; in their document, then click the icon representing the tag. now, you can insert the data for this just one-fed tag. if you want to insert the data for this straight day (such as anchor), you can fill in a different fields in dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction outlook (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information about & quantaplus; to navigate, open and pass through. in the presentation with carteireites are available for files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project using right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or delete the files from the storage medium can be carried out in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, whole web site & etc. all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on what context they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus; work area. global templates are always available, local templates only for the appropriate users and templates in projects are usable only in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripts. the concept of the structure in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the information available to a script. via the right mouse button, further functions are available, such as the script, to edit or send with email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by links to the element it will set the cursor in the document on the position of the element. by right click of an element it opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and retracing of the building.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among other building views. with it, manquickly can change attributes and namespeders. based on the content, the amendment of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development. you can download a packet documentation for & quantaplus; you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder to a project can be edited project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two boxes at the lower end of the window, can be accessed using the beneficial information: the window window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This carton display shows information on each in Quanta's running script, e.g. the current DTD of the current document and all modifications to DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This carton display shows all errors in the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensively expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the chocolate-side of the tool is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with email. & quantaplus; if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can assure them in & quantaplus, like any other backup and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It's reasonable if you want to adapt the place of the quantaplus; files on your system. for this, autoconf might have a number of options to get to the configure script. in order to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems at boot & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & KDE; 3 bin folder. also, you should ensure that no older version of & KDE; 3 in PATH is in front of her bin folder. same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; has been optimised for a rapid Web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During an effort to create the best & HTML; Editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, extendable awup languages would be? well, this would make him an absolutely treasured web development tool for & KDE; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized if you can define it in & XML; then it should be & quantaplus; therefore the suitable & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be noted that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & KDE; designed, in good use of free software, the idea of why somebody else has developed? thanks to the & KDE; -scaffold is not only all possible but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; so to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web development to amplify the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). through self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars the automation is possible almost every task. by the program Komeucalypaplus; extend without any scripting language of scripts. (more about it is found in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for a fast web development and has quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; Plus is associated with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developer left the GPL licenced version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the detailed documentation is with help: / quanta (either this URL in & Konqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / quanta run).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta is currently developed and supported by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list does not change each time if you open a file which is not located, whereby the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for the later use. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pre-list file, only one error will be reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts from the clipboard there contained special characters to & HTML; lensation, so that it displays correctly and do not understand from the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; copy, which is the correct way for inserting special characters and spaces in & URL; s is primarily used for inserting & URL; s in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the recorder and off. it allows you to select text blocks with the help of the & Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. that's very helpful if your & PHP; script error messages are out!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Search for a string of string or regular expression in selected directory. a type grep or used with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. that's the window, in which you see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Ejector switches at the bottom edge of the & quantaplus; the main reporter is activated when you are changing to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the icons-old left from the main window. this column allows you to set a bookmark with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there is a bookmark in the current file, they will appear in the menu with entries from previous or nearest, depending on the position of cursors in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmark from other open documents appear in the menu named after the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens a existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are saved with the .webprj file extension.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that might be there. this allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or a subfolder and add it to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Invites the files to your project on the server. the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of & KDE; and if you have downloaded any input / output modules (Kio Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project managed. in the chapter & quantaplus; you will find the details below.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Downloads a project tool bar. these are kept in project you / toolbars and are only in this menu, if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens up a dialogue to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be saved through attitudes actions. toolbars will be saved through tool-like toolbars or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a toolbar from the visible area. this does not extinguish them from hard drive. if you don't have the toolbar yet, you will be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">So you can send her own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team, that the tool bar is present in the next release). the menu entry opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbars on the main server, where everyone can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download one & DTD; you or any one has done and convert into the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Download / auffric of the titities out of the & DTD; is useful if the entities from the & DTEP; if this global is not present and a write permission in the global KDE file is not present, it fails to store the loading.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are available in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day installation dialog, if there is one. this entry is always available in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activated or deactivated the intelligent entry of tags. currently, this works only with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent entry means that & quantaplus, that refuses to paste through toolbar if this day contradicts the rules to this place.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu points. click it. clicking a activated plug-ins disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Elects the taxpayload mode for the current file. the list of available schematics depends on the world; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line identification. very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms for developing. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; by the external use Tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate change between different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, changing times may need or unbeautiful graphics. recommended is the card card mode, which is also the default mode, or the window mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu includes an entry for each open window. with a selection of a contract, the corresponding underwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Displays the display of the status bar at the bottom edge of the & quantaplus; main fewriters.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialogue makes every application that use the KHTML part, including the & Konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Directs the behaviour of the Editorpedo. in the documentation of & Kate; you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears, in which you can delete entries from the toolbar, or add which to change sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create an aid in the context of the mouse pointing, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and licenced, but as with every open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; they will find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled in the top right down, as for example, after filling the project called the entire directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically. all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift; F7 Project Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here's the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name file, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces using the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the server address of the machine to which one wants to access, one, except for local data. either a name (hostname.examples) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">Lets you use this field empty, the default settings of the chosen protocol is used. depending on the setup of the remote computer could be necessary to be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the Templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and default template. if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbar is stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">It allows to add files from local file system to the project. you can select several files or folders.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static webinds that you want to download and change. if you want to change and change the scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Defaults, if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project, are supposed to be inserted. if a project is started from the foundation not to haken.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make an accurate selection of coupons.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by clicking or, by removing the hamlet, claps out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistants contains three settings that can simplify your work. these settings can instantly upload or instantly upload the project properties tab in the menu window, or with the keyboard Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistants and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholder possible), which are re-compiled for project-related operations such as project folder.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Complementary option to top, even files listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded at the opening of the project. can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows you to choose the desired debugger. currently, only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger Plugin can be set with the Options button. in this case, the bug hunting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles, high loading profiles (see in) can be adjusted, as well as the display of a building view for the content of the server for each profile, by pointing one own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration you can switch event promotions and add these actions, change or delete action. event actions are executed if a specific event takes place, such as the backing of a file. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. this behavior is currently not able to influence.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Project... from the menu project or the symbol project opening from the toolbar. the dialog Project is displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus; be closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus, changed files. same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">Project supervision gives free access to the project in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, however, the entries are open and open... in conjunction with the right mouse buttoning menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here, different profiles can be chosen. the profile contains information on the site of uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removing of the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button will be blinded to prevent removing the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will keep in the core memory and forget about programming. this possibility is useful if common uploading of files is necessary, and the rather unsafe password in the record option does not come to question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or just leave the dialog if you have to change your opinion before the upload.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-loading profiles can be uploaded, so that the project (or parts of the project) are uploaded to various servers. when editing or creating a profile this dialogue is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to be copied to files. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for upload. the list depends on the version of & KDE; and installed the installed Kio Slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Port for transfer. normally this must not be changed, except the network administrator operates a service not at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety, this is either a time-saving function or a risk. use it to your discretion. the password is stored on the plate so it cannot be read, but everyone with programmers can easily see in clear text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. it can be loaded in a project many views, i.e. by simply exchange of view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored or deleted in the project, or the project toolbar, reachable via setting toolbar project toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; in its own mode of operation.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above are toolbars in & quantaplus; best about the menu of toolbars. use and adding. adding tool bar will be treated below in the section Add of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols can be set either by context menu (right click on the tool bar), in which with new action, remove new toolbars or toolbars, what can be stated in the dialog, where the actions can be displayed on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, in addition, the entries are removed and action worked, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can set up actions in the menu with settings toolbars... and setting up actions...</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in the essential document skeleton, code cuts and files to link. & quantaplus; it can copy, postpone or any other existing file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, postpone or any other existing directory included in the storage room. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you propose to the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; included templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not purer text. it can be inserted any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, flash files & etc; binary designs are inserted in documents using links (e.g. pictures with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are available in the storage room under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be printed from any text document. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally a simple scaffolding for the purpose and organises work in a special way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates. see in for more information to the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind templates is useful if not a new document is inserted based on a template but the same text area always in the documents. you can find everything from a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl based. some examples are available in the storage room under global templates. see in for more information to the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve all websites as templates. you are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder hierarchy, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure according to exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and choose file As template storing as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this happens, notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the storage room under the project engineering.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on the File Report as a template of local / project template. alternatively, the choice is easily drawn with pulling and dismantling on the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file is only enough to copy in a pre-level file. all file management functions can be used, such as pulling and dismantle or inserting over the file-tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select in the file tree or in the project files building view on a folder on the right and secure site template. by default, it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very effective pre-oriented incident. you can create headline and footer-line or dynamically. to create files or link with them. additionally, you can keep certain things in the eye using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The basic structure in the subwindow templates are based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / share / quanta / template and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / templates. each of these folders is equivalent to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To determine the behavior of a folder, click the folder with the right mouse button to select and select the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A select box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded, as soon as eleven attributes is blinded.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default. if a regular folder was set to deactivate it in this path, it would seem explicitly enabled in this path, unless they appear to appear in a normal folder. if nothing appears, it is likely to be found in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows you to be displayed or re-issued text for templates in this folder. this could be general header or footer for all templates for a specific project and allows copying of contents into a folder with special headline / footer a whole presentation already with the suitable headline / footer lines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (pointing to, right mouse button) above a complete instructions for adding-folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; source editor that can be reached via menu view. the first mode replaces the source editor through the VPL; Editor and the second divides the editing window in two parts: the source editor and the VPL; Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL Editor functions as follows: it invites a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and an cursor will appear. then you can edit and reset to the source code editor, in which the amendments are displayed in the VPL file.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; Editor on a document that contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; file editing. to edit & PHP; there is no plans to change this behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first one, except that at the same time, changes both in the source editor and VPL; -Editor synchronously are activated, this mode is already active, transferred the key printing the active cursor from a window to another, where the position is preserved in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; Editor and the source editor can be set adjustable via settings Quanta.... It can be automatically set between synchronisation after a click or automatically. in addition, the recommendation can be set automatically. in principle, the recommendation can be set for fast calculator and a great span for slow calculator.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so it is possible to choose the title of the web page. this is also called the document properties tab at work with the VPL; editor is also called, as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; -Editor, this is used to reduce the binding tissue. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags allow the storage of information on the document itself e.g. buzzwords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pushing the two buttons below or removed. a click into the list allows the change of the inhaled, such as keywords on the column name and keyword key word2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the presentation of pages in the browser. you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete. a change over the list is possible just as with the meta-elements. the edit of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to bind an external CSS style template by pressing the file button and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor is like in a word processor, due to moving with the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor will behave like usual. the markings works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and can be deleted by button or removal code.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags will be done in the same way via toolbar, as in the source editor. it is to note that the insertion of tags are previously inserted an existing identical tags, if an anchor-tag, is enclosed with text, every other surrounding anchor must be removed.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphics tools to compare. why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated, because one of the contributions had changed a lot of changes, and at the same time it had changed a lot of changes. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">This program used to me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within this lines. and there was no clues on the places where perhaps only the decline had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could result differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, any quantity of additional useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare quickly text, simply copy it into the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made much work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function transformed & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful if two persons are working independently of each other one piece of code and changes the original file. in this editor you can even edit the result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. in this editor, you can download the result directly. the screenshot shows three quell files to merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you with the same and merging complete folder. this screen picture shows & kdiff3; when folder:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and also include the capabilities of today's colour monitors. if you have frequently check code, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no trouble more if no one changes the integration.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If one file is equal, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files are in the same name, but in different folders, you can use the Tipperwork by creating only the file names in the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog allows manual entry of file names, selecting the file browser (file...) or select an last open file from the folding list. you don't have to specify a third file. if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences are performed with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">On the knob folder... you can also select a folder. if you choose a folder, the comparisons or merge of folders will be selected, for B and C, but a folder, then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When connecting, the input field is active for the target and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily necessary to determine an output file immediately. you can also do this step later.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The button button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting with the comparing / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare the whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparative window. the comparison starts immediately. in opening dialog, you do not need to select files easily with the break button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and dismantle: simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall in a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would have to compare two corresponding files to it in & kdiff3; download and then compare the relevant sections, and then compare it.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: there is currently nothing out of & kdiff3; out. only the text box is supported in a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and dismantle the text into another program as output and insert (instead of copying and insert). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text box there is the Info line. the information line of the source window contains the character A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that windows C is optional). (if the path comes to a file, let the mouse take a while over the row. then a small charity window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three sources of the source are the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these settings can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is recognized, one can differentiate on the color which file differs. if both files differ, the colour scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that's in the next section (merge) good to see.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links to the text is the summary column. when differences were found, the column displays the appropriate color. with some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, B. are white characters only in string strings and comments, for preprocessor and in a few, rare cases relevant.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, dividing the merge column, is interrupted at the digits, where the respective source file has no lines. if the line of line is activated, the line is shown in broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The results window (among the comparisons) also has a personal Info line with the inscription:, the filename and [and change] if you have edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, the store is disabled!!! (use the buttons to nächtigen / unresolved conflict to find the still remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons can be used, each difference is also necessary to solve the problem of manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the first row of the group is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. (this is also a jump from the position in the windows, where the beginning of the group is not visible.) This group is lifted up with the color background colour for current area and on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes it will be left out by automatic merge or by manual editing any further line more in the group; but this is only a placeholder for the event that you can change your opinion, and perhaps again another source. this text appears neither in the final stored file, nor in a selection you might want to copy and insert something different.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; summarized; however, it appears in the clipboard when you copy the text from the results window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the sources select the options, ignore or Ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the image sequence and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are using in one of the window, you can also use the arrow keys at the beginning, beginning, end, trl-beginning and Ctrl-end, siw how you can also use it from other programs. click here to Navigate navigate.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other keys to edit. using the insert button, you can switch between insert and overclock mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchronizes the view of all windows onto the beginning of the respective group (as stated in the section and the editable explorisation window was explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture upwards / Strg-picture downward) or to the next / former conflict (Ctrl-picture upward / Strg-picture) or to the next / former conflict. therefore, there must be differentiated between deleted and unresolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker in the clipboard, you'll need to automatically copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-insert). if this is enabled, whatever you mark, automatically fallback into the clipboard. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally write the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line end are stored according to the initial operating system\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the last files used will be automatically stored and restored with the next start. (menu entry &gt; KDiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a script by fixed width. (on some systems, dialog can also use more variable width on a selection, you should not use this.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you activate this option, differences are displayed in italic script. if the chosen scripture doesn't support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors may not be available in their pure form but would be rendered. on these systems, the button preferences automatically displays an odd colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the tabulator button will be inserted into the appropriate number of spaces. otherwise, a tabulator character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you push the input or return, the default line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection will automatically be copied to the clipboard. the manual copy into the clipboard is cancelled then.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which tick-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files try & kdiff3; first, all fully identical lines in the source files can be ignored. only during this first step you can ignore white characters. the second step compares white characters. in this step, white characters will not ignore.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a car type '\\' and a line slot '\' at the end of one line, but then you could only store files with different sizes at the side-to-side comparison, however, if this option is activated, a white character will be handled. during the merge this option must be disabled. in default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis you will ignore numbers and related characters ('0' -' 9 ','. ',' - '). in the result the differences are still shown, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive to smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automation mode, this attitude will determine how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next Hungarian conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solves automatic all conflicts in white characters by selecting the chosen file as a source. (default is manual selection). if you need this only of time to time, use better the functions of voters in numbers or comments, if the options are to ignore or Ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options will be treated in chapters to scan and execute merging. look for details under documentation for directory comparing and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, the original version is done by the Suffix .original version, if already a such backup file is done with the Suffix .original, this will be removed without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of user interface. changing this option does not change the current running program. you need to end and restart the current program. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set up globally across the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry. if you activate this option, it will be used for all entries the top setting.</seg>
<seg id="2340">About the selection process for encoding appears a short notice of what is local encoding. (this cannot be changed here and has a informal character here.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences such as special characters treated and interpret. since encoding for each file is individually adjustable, files can be compared and merged with different encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited one file, you can specify which encoding will be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing command, they might not work with your codec. (e.g., your files can handle 16-bit Unicode, but the process command can only deal with 8-bit ASCII files).</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress highlighting changes in white characters in the text or oversight. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments, if the options are activated or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences may see between two of three files. by selecting A & lt; -gt; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed next to the normal still a second excess column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. see the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Orders the same window next to each other or overlap. this can also be useful to ads from long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and decide so suddenly, when you compare only two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as pre-set name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, the name of the last used output file is maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">In reading one file it will first pass this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor, which is precisely your requirements. for example, you can use this function, for example, to remove interference.</seg>
<seg id="2350">In reading one file it will first pass this external command first. if a standard pre-processing command is passed. if you write a normal pre-processing command, you can only write your own preprocessor, which matches exactly your requirements. each input line must have a related issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind it is to allow users to enable more flexibility when choosing the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users want to program this. however, the good news is, however, that in most cases, sed or perl completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some key words to paste the generated character strings (info: / cvs / keyword\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While experimenting with sed experiment, you may begin to understand it and perhaps like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar stuff.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring numbers of numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of a further processing command for ziggur. sed 's / [0123456789.-] / / g' Every sign between '[' and ']' is a key, and each hits will be replaced by nothing, so quasi deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several encourages at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the needs of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed, you can also use something different such as perl -p -e 's / REGEXP / replacement / switch' allergies are different from perl some details different. where used\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 's) needed.</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor are maintained for viewing and interaction. the further operations change only data, which sees the line-off-algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-off-preprocessor look the output of normal preprocessor.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences, you may not notice certain differences in accidental and worst important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge using & kdiff3; complete folders.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for every object; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and displays the simulated changes without it really carry out,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... carry out selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparing and merge of individual files. you only need to specify a file on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are assembled, folder 1 is used as a base. if no target is specified, used & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start to merge the merge. to select the merge, select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During the folder, you will inform you a small news window about the current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folder, only the files are listed, which have been compared until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, & kdiff3 shows the window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Any file and any folder was found during the scan, displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouseclick.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is normally folded, by clicking on the + / - click on the object or by clicking on the object / click on the left / right. the directory menu includes two functions of all subdirectories and open all subdirectories, with which you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the column Name reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folder, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane on the selected object. in such a case, the merge operation can not automatically be selected. if the merge is started, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, the color is identical, even when the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders will be identical as the same as their whole content is identical. then, folders is the same color. in folders, the age is insignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a sheet again, which is only green, then yellow will be and later, when it is old, red is red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy from B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy from A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g., if a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types exist. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g., if a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types exist. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronize mode is active, if only two folders and no explicit targets are provided, and if the option is synchronize, then select & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that afterwards both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical are: merge and the result in both folders. (the user watches as visible file names for output file only B; copied directly after the merge & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders will be merged, and select the newer file instead of merge (unsafe), then examine & kdiff3; the date of files and suggests a error message: files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such mistakes can not be fixed, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merge, one file is working according to the other. it shows the status column being successful, and according to other messages when something unexpected was done. if the merge is complete, you should check out a final review and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog, the file comparative analysis is selected, KDiff3 will show more columns. these contain the number of invincible, dissolved, not white and white conflicts. (the column for dissolved conflicts is only shown if three files are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge either the selected entry (file or mercenaries), or all entries at once. if you have selected all merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can initiate the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no target user, then it will be used in the Three-file merge mode C as a target, when using two-file merge, B is chosen as a target and used to synchronize A and / or B as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you select a target user, please check if all entries must be displayed in the objective folder, even in folder structure. there are some options to be skipped in the certain entries. check out these options to avoid unlovable surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To summarize all entries: select directories and continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the key shortcut). in order to bring only the current item: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If by conflicting file types still exist invalid merge actions, a message appears on the defective elements. you can then select a valid action.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialogue window appears with the options, simulate and abort.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose Simulations if you want to see what would happen without the really changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (see the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select another directory together / continue or press F7. if you still haven't saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then & kdiff3; his work continues with the next story.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a mistake, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list you can relieve some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem. thus, you have the opportunity to select another action for the entry or solve the problem, before you proceed with the interaction.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, & kdiff3, these entries (in the current session) and performs it later in later, these entries are taken or not stored again. only if you change the merge action, these entries are regrouped again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3 setup...) has now a section called Directory-merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified patterns are shown in the element tree. separating the pattern with a semicolone; a valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not comply with this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern, are not shown in the element tree. it can be used more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern, are not shown in the element tree. it can be used more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignore files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autosmatic files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be specified with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, you have a hiding place attribute. in other file systems, a previous score marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the Elementum or not. this option is switched ON in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic link will be compared. if the option is switched on, the files will be compared to the links. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is switched off, the links below are switched on. if the option is switched on, the links are treated as normal folders. (note that & kdiff3; not on possible recursions. a link to itself would lead to a final loop and run & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and shows the statistics columns. (the number of redeemed, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower if they are applied to files that do not contain any text. (specify an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large files across a slow network, it may be faster, only the changestion and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain measure of security. please use caution. this option is guned at default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to Confidentition date. there is no real comparison rather than it is identical. this may be useful when copying the changestion date. please use caution. please use caution. this option is guned at default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronize mode, if two files are compared and no target folder was indicated. in this mode the proposals are identical to merge. the results of merge files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences instead, the copy of the newer file is proposed as action. (this will be considered unsafe, because it will not change the knowledge that the other file is not even modified.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder will be replaced by another folder or delete the extension .original. if an old backup file is deleted with the .original extension already exists, this will also be deleted without further backup. this also applies the normal merge of single files, not only the merge complete folder. this option is switched ON in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merging view is visible in the merge of single files; you can switch the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want this, you can turn the window into the window menu and switch the change between directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file via double-click. however, in the directory menu, you can also use a single file directly. if you store the result, the status will be done directly, and the file will not be fed again if you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">But this status is lost, however, if you need to read the directory: directory menu: new</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with help from Kio Slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders, which are located on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local file.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has other syntax as local files and folders. a few things should be observed:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path may be relatively expensive or.. contain. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, blank spaces &gt;% 20, etc.) for example, has a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes, due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol. it follows a brief list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link will be on a file or folder. then a file will always be accepted as a link goal. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no option to edit permissions or change of change. hence, the permissions or change date from the original. (please refer to the confidentiality option.) (This is only possible at local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop starts to start the built-in differences. in order to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the difference and then select In KDiff3Part show from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally requires & kdiff3; two complete input files, if it is used as a substitute, take & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. then it will start & kdiff3; the patch program starts to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu look inside - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since creating the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merge or comparisons is not supported in part mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">There are already tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it's Kompare) already. also, the name KDiff3 indicates that it can merge like the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs very long and have learned a lot by using other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or get it so.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have probably compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure script for the configure script in / usr / local, but then KDE can not find resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only one non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not as identical. iF similar lines: next to Each other, this duis, but this is more often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is noticeable for any difference in the files where he starts and where he finishes. this is necessary to simply remove a conflict through the click into the source text and select button A / B / C. however, this important information is easily stored as text file, and it is too much effort to design an additional file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was so far too big. you can recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to edit larger quantities on text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text, no src left; appeared and the text cannot delete. what does this mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; many colors used to create lower differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use an editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports come from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the functions of & kdiff3; you need & KDE; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">For information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the last changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the Changelog file in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">Around & kdiff3; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder installed in your system, installed in the KDE. if you are unsafe, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automaker are used, you shouldn't have any problems with compiling. nevertheless, trouble occurs, please report on the & KDE; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) in the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift) add the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replaces the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files are identical in all folders are not in folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current version version you will need to upgrade to these options to the folder with the function Refresh.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries to show the differences that are not included in the target file. if the target of these files do not already contain these files, they are missing after the merge. (behavior will be cancelled later in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose from the source with the certificate A, B and C below the menu bar. if you are installed on one of the buttons, lines are attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed in the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">By default, this option is disabled. the differences in different characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a miniature preview of all virtual work areas. it is quite practical to view the ongoing programs on the workspaces, to change its size to end them or postpone. this works both within a desktop or even at several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can view all virtual work areas as well as applications. applications can be selected and even be moved on desktop and other applications.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible in both desktop and other areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: on the empty background of & Kpager, the context menu has only been clicked on an application within & Kpager; but if there is also the symbol and the name of the application and the entries minimize, maximize, on desktop and view.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when it was clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is marked, windows can be moved within & Kpager, with the middle mouse button in mind and also to other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in & Kpager, the names of virtual work areas are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field allows the & Kpager to display the numbers of virtual working surfaces. it is shown together with name indicate, the names are provided with ordinate numbers, eg; 1. mind.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background every desktop is displayed as background in & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the current programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager. otherwise, only the empty workspaces are displayed in order to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its standard symbol and pixel. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very quick systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager can be determined: traditionally lets & Kpager; in some other windows managers appear in some other windows; horizontal and vertical in a vertical range, which is very good for viewing sideways in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager miniature program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, displaying the windows as symbols or with their content. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right click the right button within & Kpager; and followed by switching the switch... allows the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this can not be changed in the dialog Settings... but you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you don't need a write permission for the file, you must register as user root or apply to your system administrator. in this file you need to sign the windowal mode and point to that value. possible values are:</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & Kpager; part of the package kdebase is, you need a working installation of the KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click once the mouse pointing a while on the same place. it is thought to help people who emulate the repetitive strain Injury (RSI) Syndrome and those of each mouse click pains. however, this requires a bit exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can cope with the pain when clicking on the mouse and helps to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also suffer from the naked desire of the mouse. do you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer, if you need a doctor if this is not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify it once more: even if & kmousetool will avoid pain, which arise when clicking with the mouse, it is against pain that are caused by moving the mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can be turned out differently.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click once you interrupt the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the smart relocating, power & kmousetool; a break after the mouse button is emulated. move now the mouse, wait until the end of the motion. in this way you can run the drag by pressed mouse button. in this way, you can insert the drag by pressed mouse button. in this way, you can use a little exercise, but you get used to it fast.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This break-time has to be stiffled after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; one mouseclick.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If the intellect is switched on, the filming time (1 / 10 s) is active. here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after lowering the mouse button, before leaving the mouse button, the mouse button is made again.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports the click through mouse displacement. this function is activated, followed by a break, a click to the right mouse button. a slow motion to the left and back leads to a double-click. these movements are saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt when the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can reduce the reaction time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, choose sound system and here the rider general. there is a shift sound buffer, which you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response time.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, it will start & kmousetool; starting in every start of & KDE; this feature is currently only available at GNOME or other window environments, in order to find out how you automatically start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">If all the settings were set on the values, which were set when opening the dialog. have you already pressed the button on users, the settings will be reset to the last drop of users.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first use the preferences. in particular, the smart relocating should you first off first. if you then used to get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later take the smart shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response time of & KDE; if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of what places a mouseclick without effect remains: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that do not pose a link, you can park in such places until you would like to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually rather simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come with the mouse ball in touch.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you have to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse is different from mouse. but it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rollers. these are attached to the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and dirt can easily scrape you with a flat blade or finger nails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you just started using the smart shift, this means that & kmousetool, which can stop the operation no longer by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use below another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you run yourself a mouse click. here is the status of & kmousetool; reset, and you can rework as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: when you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another spot.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to take it. however, use the mouse to a neutral area of mind if you are looking for a button. secure zones for the mouse pointer is & eg; the grey areas around the toolbar and menus and front lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart shift, but I don't make it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart relocating is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it needs its time before you can handle it. it's very probably possible to attach it to the clipboard or move it into the clipboard or add any other action. however, it will probably cause some problems:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart relocating if you just start using & kmousetool; click the following text as follows: take a mouse click and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointing at the other end of the text and again the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will always be played when & kmousetool; the mouse button presses sound like a mouseclick. so, you know exactly when the smart relocust begins. later, you can use the smart relocating without the audible mouseclick. but in addition, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; use the Xtest extension for & X Window; it should be installed on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The audible mouse clicks only is available if the system has a sound card and speaker, and are set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; put the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointing out. this program has been developed for people who suffer from the RSI syndrome, and that the betting of the brickest pain is prepared.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured that a certain period is waiting that a pulling process begins, before the mouse button is let off. in this way, pulling and dismantle with the mouse can also be done.</seg>

<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages like & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning has priority and holds the output of messages and normal text. these orders will continue after the release of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next great priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; a long text to read on a website you can welcome you with & kmouth. & KDE; notifications are also news. read about this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every order you encounter orders on the card order is a text contract. KSayit is an example of a applications that are used for text applications. text orders are intended for the output longer texts that have no special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders will be operated in queues, except the output of Screen Readern. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one such pre-reads will be stopped and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters will never be applied to the issue of Screen-Readern. they are applied to normal warnings, messages, and text applications as well as on & KDE; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text, and enter it on the next filter. currently, there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are implemented as modules. in the future, there can still be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Drawing parts of a text by other text. the resulting parts can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions. the creation of chat-cheek-cheek will be delivered with text or formatted messages; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; Modification use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to another format. in scope of supply of & ktts; some XSLT files are used for the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">You can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program, which send the text to & ktts. for example, if you have set a female voice, you can read text from KDE messages about it. Siehe. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filter has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied to a speech output. if the filter sets that his rules does not apply, he continues to keep the text in the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & KDE; notification to & ktts; it will be edited by all activated filters, which have been installed on the page below. editing the filter is made up in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of inserted normal filters. if a filter isn't checked, it is not enabled and is not used. filter will run the range from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filters, and it will be displayed next to the following setup dialogues.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting of character coaches, you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparative patterns. if these patterns are exchanged in the text, the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text. large and small-text is not considered.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name if you just need to distinguish themselves from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column formity, replacing it in accordance with the string from the column list. the list is executed in the displayed order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can store a list of words or regular expressions from a file, store the current list or delete. download a list of a file, the entries from the file is attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Here is a language registered, the filter is used only if the speaker for the text job is one of the registered languages. click on the button to view a list of the languages. you can also press multiple languages if you press the mouse click the & Ctrl; -button.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is registered here, the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">You can use the qdbus program with the qdbus program; the & DBus; numbers have to leave you. if for example, qdbus; the application ID copied-3432 can only be copied.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The drawing filter is applied only in the text, if all conditions apply to one entry in the box diesen filter if match. are all input fields empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">By comparison, the character filter is used regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. words have to be limited by separating characters (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual, you will find no guidance for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; for & # 160; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; expressions can be found in the parambigtils package.</seg>

<seg id="2650">Specify the path to the program xsltproc. if xsltproc is accessible via the environment variable PATH, is also enough xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2651">You can send texts to a particular speaker with the speaker selection, which is set up on the map card speaker, or by a speaker with certain characteristics. you can designate the text by kmail from a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts a text to the filter, it is searching for a speaker for the text. the speaker is displayed on the basis of the speaker features that send the text to & ktts; sends, and select the features of the speaker's speaker. speaking with the speaker filter you can overwrite the chosen narrator.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Here is a value registered, the filter is applied if the text contains the given regular expression. is installed on your system of & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Select, you can call this button on the button to get help in the input.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve a faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Here, place the properties of your desired text editor. if the text fulfilled the above filter conditions, the speaker is selected to preview the desired requirements for the test. click on the button to display the dialog talking.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your interferences, or delete all settings.</seg>

<seg id="2676">The list of the above languages can be incomplete or obsolete. therefore, drag the description of Synthesizer to the supported languages. look at the website of ktops., according to information, which are not included in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The program "speech-dispatcher" uses a customizable module architecture for speech synthesizers. if you want to expand & ktts; for use of another synthesizers, you sit with the developing team in connection.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filters is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the command apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile & compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (Version 3.4 or newer) including packages of cdelibs and the development files for the program "speech dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from the source code, from the source code for kdeduct or to have downloaded a tarball every night, please translate and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you & ktops; use, check first if speech-dispatcher with your language synthesizer correctly works. in addition, you can use the Shellskript SPD-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & KDE; 4.4 is the first version of & ktops, which is used to develop the program speech-dispatcher. the program kttmsgr should be developed so further that the device of speech-dispatcher is directly possible and the script SPD-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is decomposed into individual sentences. the user can restart - or drop-off, repeat the output or break off.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application has an application to & ktts, it can request a female English speaker for example. if you have set up a speaker, this is used for example a female English speaker. if you choose a speaker, otherwise it will automatically choose the best appropriate speaker. if you want to learn more about how & added; a speaker chosen, see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">When you click on the map speaker, click to add or edit a speaker into the list or to edit, the card interface setup is displayed. as an example, the module is shown in the module for Festival Interactive. details on modules will be found below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable events program. if the path is included to the festival in PATH, you just need to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text, which is handed over to the festival. it is true that western languages are used to use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak languages (ISO 8859-2).</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders, you can adjust volume, microphone speed and pitch of synthetic language. if you can't select some regulator and display these grey, you can't choose this settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like multi-syn voices need to be loaded for several seconds to be loaded up. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded with the start of KTTSD so that (in higher memory consumption) the first set is synthesized.</seg>

<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application to read the messages. if you & eg; just a long text on a web site, you can welcome you with & kmouth; nevertheless, to meet someone who enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen-reader, add & ktts; the audio output in the queue long.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both introductory sounds are active as well as introductory message, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card card are only valid for normal text-orders. for messages, warnings, and the issues of screen editing, there are no special actions, if this is interrupted by a higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktts; KNotify messages, start kttsmgr and click notifications.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for a voice output. this standard contains trademarks for controlling the voice and pitch. in addition, trademarks for controlling the pronunciation of pronunciation, for example, abbreviations. SSML is a part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following limitations are present:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male) as this is the standard voice which uses the SSML output.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100lt; SSML text is usually spoken very monoton.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and punctuation recognition filter (SDB filters). SBDs must be synthesized, as only the first set will be synthesized, not the whole text order. so you can also stop or break down and break down, even if the speech synthesizers does not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the propositional recognition filter. at the first start of & ktts; you can change its settings or add a set of punctuation filters, but it is excessively distorted.</seg>
<seg id="2729">In the easiest way to check out the selection of speaking selection by selection. place the speaker selection contracts, what speaker & ktts; select some features and check out how the selection of microphone has changed. you must naturally have more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then can start to read faster with the pre-read, since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then subscribe to the card ticket orders or break down, even if the speech synthesizers does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal punctuation filter is set up automatically when you start mtsmgr for the first time. it can not be switched off, only away. change nothing at this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In terms of proposition identification filter, compare the text with a regular expression of proposition (Decimal code 8) to the set limits. (tabulators are automatically removed from the text). note that the standard-punctuation filter is retains the character recognition filter.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filter will never be applied on & KDE; messages (kins), warnings, messages, or the issue of Screen-Readern.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal punctuation filter, you can insert it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2736">You can overwrite the archive settings for the application. the card card is displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speakers (the top on the card card). in other words, there are no speaker characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the appropriate speaker, which displays all characteristics of a speaker speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings; otherwise chooses & ktts. otherwise chooses & ktts; the speaker made at the beginning the original set features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method for entering the desired alarm properties by clicking on one of the select buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If this feature doesn't matter. if this feature doesn't matter, you don't give anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box when the property is supposed to have other features. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in the issue of issue, this property is always treated as priority. the only case if you may want to specify the attribute language, lies ahead, if you know a specific application will be sent out in another language as the language of the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all characteristics in the field, the closest speaker is to delete, click on the select button, and then use the speaker, which is the closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (no order number is required 0).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately if it started. I have compiled Debug support but I don't get any traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and & ktts. probably, you have to register GStreamer. at GStreamer 0.8.x is the command GST-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved, you may not install any compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work when I play with another application of music. if I stop a text contract, freezes & ktts; a message which says: to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, the problem is that conflicts with ALSA will prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. references for possible solutions can be found on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) under www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an additional voice for the internet from the internet. I have installed it and can use it at Festival, but kttsmgr this voice doesn't show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / vocals the new voice. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; where you have found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">At the card board audio, there's a setting speed. so this works, the program SOX has to be installed and about the ambient variable PATH. some synthesizers such as Festival Interactive offer itself on the card card for speaker equipment. depending on the chosen voice, this actively or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speaking speed will be ignored when & ktts; & HTML; (this is that the HTML in SSML is transformed.) Deactivate either the filter for conversion of & HTML; according to XML; (see) or if you are quite courageous, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -to-SSML conversion filter, and set up the microphone speed up.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't make it that web pages are read with a female voice. I created a female festival speaker, but & ktats; reads the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the day Sable GENDER does not seem to work. this makes the xsl file for converting SSML to Sbut the GENDER tags. it also applies to VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a custom custom filter filter, and now I can proceed in & ktts; no longer a full way or go back. on the box orders the order is displayed only from a set. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Intersection symbols (point, question mark, exclamation marks, comma and semicolon) you may not filter out. use a filter for propositional recognition for these characters instead.</seg>
<seg id="2757">Alsa (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). Alsa is installed on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure the modules are registered for GStreamer by calling the GST register. (HTTP: / / gstreamer.freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts in the audio issue. if your system is counting, you can't play music and read a text. & ktats; freezes another when you start a text job and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">With as of July 2005, aKode does not support real breaks. if you have a text job in & ktts, the current proposition is still read.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The SOX audio program is used for the general setting of speaking speed, but otherwise not necessarily necessary. Debian users can install SOX by command apt-get install SOX. the program is already included on most & Linux; CDs are already included.</seg>
<seg id="2762">If you downloaded & ktts; as tarball (with tar packages archive), sign up as a normal user and unzip the tarball into a matching folder. change to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & KDE; 4 is the module & arts; probably from or at least only a requirement is created.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for language synthesizers are created by default. some of them have a run-time dependency of non-free software. (non-free after the directing of the def distribution), the configure parameter indicates the configure parameter, which causes the transition.</seg>

<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizer whose source code is revealed. quality of the voices is generally good, and there are multiple voices and languages supported. with many voices you can adjust volume, microphone speed and pitch with & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. help you find in the instructions that are delivered with the festival. would you like to read web pages, you need to install the (male British) voice Rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice sets the Festival 1.95 beta or later. the voice is still in an early stage stage. unzip the software at festival / lib / vocals / russian. if you enter the Russian voices you need to enter the votes msu _ ru _ nsh _ diphone. select a Cyrillic acid (8 bit-) coding such as KOI8-R.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; that allows administration of network interfaces, the routings and the DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting K menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to enable users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; create a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module interface will be displayed in & kcontrolcenter; the network settings (knetworkconf;) can be launched by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & network networking settings in & kmenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and its drivers have to be operational, so that & knetworkconf; the device at all indicates and the setting of network characteristics enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases drivers are installed for the network hardware and other devices for installing and Linux; installed and set up. network appliances will be added later, drivers have to be loaded by adapting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network Settings module is loaded, if the network settings will be selected in the & kcontrolcenter; the module interface will try to automatically detect the platform used by the module.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the draft option is offered. it is the platform from the list, which will meet the distribution and Releasestand best. by marking the setting non-again questions can be hit permanently. at the next start of the network settings, this selection will then be pre-set.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode. before, all options are displayed in grey, meaning the settings can only be considered, the change mode is not possible at the bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password mode at the bottom of the module.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The module's functionality is available in the system administration mode. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interface interfaces to manage network appliances of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from the tab network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">Setting up network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click of the button... in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. clicking on the Advanced Extended settings displays the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection Automatically the TCP / IP settings are collected by a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP address will be provided with the startup of the system. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection manual, without DHCP or BOOTP, the TCP / IP address can be specified. in the input field IP address the required TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field network maske is fixed the subnetmask.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is marked, the system initialize the network interface in boats. if the initialization is not allowed, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address will not be used in the network. entering a already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console; you may find if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network appliances can be switched or switched off on required. switching on a network device is done by selecting from the list and click interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network appliances can be switched or switched off depending on demand. switching off a activated network device is done by selecting from the list and click the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host in local subnet, which mediates the physical connection to remote networks and is provided by default for TCP / IP communication with machines in other submissions.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than a network interface, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain extension through the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the computer calls http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will solve this name into an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator for the namespace solution enables a simple administration of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed .DNS entries can be arranged through a selection of a contract and executures in the list with buttons or shutting in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Clicking button Add... from the group's host solution can be added to a DNS server. it will add the New Nameserver dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, you need to enter the DNS server address and then click the button Add. the entry is then inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group's group to name resolution, select one entry and then click on the button.... It will edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of nameally known hosts observes computer-to-IP address links for TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily when boats are available, if no DNS servers are available. in small, enclosed networks it can replace DNS-server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list contains the list nameally known hosts some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. these are still in the current version of IP should replace in the future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known host and click Add.... The New Adalias will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known host and click the button. if the well-known computer has several alias names, de button add multiple times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a well-known machines from the list and select Edit.... The dialog Converts Calculator is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">You can run one of the following tasks, then click OK to get the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings set in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system. to activate the changes must be set in a & console; the following command must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & KDE and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in one & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphic surfaces such as kpackage or installation tool of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, Qt and & KDE is sufficient for this case; not, but in addition, development packages are required with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">Only experienced users are recommended. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should afford this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic network technology are given, in the second, all of & knetworkconf; change configuration files discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section can not replace good knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PCs are mediated into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never expected large spread. this description is therefore concentrated in the near future. therefore, this description focuses on the spread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the note that IP address can be connected to a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace is the network administrator if available, DHCP can be used. definitely, the IP address can not be chosen as usual!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When replacing a own small (home) network should be selected the IP address from a specially designed for this purpose to avoid IP address accounts with the global (Internet) network. addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, therefore its any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a Gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks usually use addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask will usually be set at 255.255.255.0 so that all machine participants are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = of its own host). the standard route is required for the IP continuation.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface that works like a closed loop.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files are located, which are affected by & knetworkconf; where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed in DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if in the case of active DSL connections, another content is defined as specified.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE, it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand can be seen as expected.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& dat; is a ensuring program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the opportunity to create multiple archives on a band. the first was the capacity of dds2tar for quick, selective outpack. the second goal was to answer a question that made my wife: how much longer takes it when you secures?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be tied by & kdat; it can happen on three types:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; do the band back and reads the prestressing of the band. recognize & kdat; the pioneer in the band will not be asked if the band will be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognize & kdat; the anticipation, search for the appropriate index on your record. can't be found, you will be asked if the bandindex is to be re-created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol changes for the tape drive to indicate that the band was tied up. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the content of the Bandes can now be searched by the entry of the entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In front of the discard of the band, first integration must first be solved. there are three methods to achieve this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& dat; gives an amendment to the tape for the band that the integration of the tape was solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be cast out without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat; can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band species must be formatted before you can use to save data. this process does not correspond to the formatting at & kdat; this process needs to be formatted before using the band by & kdat; formatted. Floppy tape drives are usually formatted a form of tape ahead, DAT drives.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the tape called and the capacity drives & kdat; with the formatting tape. all data on the band are lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically bound and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the securing procedure, you must select the safest files. it can happen on three types:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only be saved in this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a safety profile in the tree. only files are stored in the profile specified.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in local file tree with a hakite. only the selected files and / or subfolder are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right click on the local file-tree, and select in the Sheches menu.</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was initiated, the settings will open for backup. in this dialogue, you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog appears. the dialog indicates the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the files for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the files for the band with a hakite. only the selected files and / or subfolder are checked.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to recreate the band indexfile using the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two kinds of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This will create a safety profile with the just selected files and default settings. you can use the following settings for a safety profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current workbook in which the backup should be made. the list of transparent files is automatically updated according to the correct working order.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders, which are listed under backup files, is that only those files are stored on the same file system, such as the folder. folders that are on other file systems can be ordered separately under backup files. every entry is considered by tar independent of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental Backup, a snapshot file will be used. only files are saved since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used for determining the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling the tar. this causes all files to be saved and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; gt; and; lt; files was not completely implemented at the time of the creation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up via the KDat menu option... in the Settings menu, you can use the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / Tape). this path must refer to non-rewinding option of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transfers & kdat; before the band is tied to load, it is necessary to load before reading or write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, tries & dat; to lock the throw at the tape drive. possibly, this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, when loosing the integration of & kdat; automatically the band will be cast off. do not use this option with Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, try & dat; the hardware block size for tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drive provides information.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & dat; a band formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only prove a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band-ID. the format of this string is host: seconds, whereby the name of the full name of the system is formatted on which the band has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds since the epoch has been formatted in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives created directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incremental fuses.</seg>

<seg id="2942">In addition, offers & kssystem log; experienced users for quick access to information about problems that can appear on their server. & kssystem log; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features which can be filtered and evaluated using certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksos log; a number of useful functions. among other things, include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included, and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen photo, features & ksystemlog; functions available, with whose help the single protocol-lines of a protocol-file easily filter and sorting. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & kssystem log; first the main protocol-file of the system - to open the system protocol; it will not be opened as a small news window, so you have started using system verwalterright. usually the protocol files are normally found in the file / var / log, for the normal user usually don't have any justification for reading.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar, in order to filter according to a selected criterion or in the filter bar. in the default setting, the drop line will be displayed next to the selected filter. then a protocol-line is displayed only if one of the columns contain the string of the filter pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another associated entry at this site. in the protocol-file system protocol, select the column process, and wear it in the filter bar called the name of a process, so shows you & ksystemlog; all the protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you identify the key protocol lines. protocol-lines of level errors are displayed with a striking color as a protocol-lines of the level note. the color display of the protocol-lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show certain process (for example, in the system protocol or the cron protocol), so you can select the process identification (PID) in the column process. that may be useful for example if you want to investigate the output of a certain command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option on new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new upcoming protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate bases. to open this feature, use the entries in menu window to open up and manage. once you have selected a sub-window, select a protocol for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website based on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.or.Dort. you will find more recent information about the reference sources of & kssystems log.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& kssystem log; also find in the following folder of the & KDE; -Subversion-Archive: kssystem log; in & KDE; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & KDE; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also so called) as & ksysv; this section shows a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V Init quickly evolved into the standard for control of the program starts when driving the system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD -init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about this: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is why somebody could try to expand a machine on System V Init without creating a reinstallation and re-format. therefore, you need to secure that the old init was removed from there, if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are in a subfolder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort is rc.sysinit and the following further folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot scripts. in principle, you need a script for any system service which you want to launch on a other Runlevel. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setset, which will only be launched. such views belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be used under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it does not have much use for it. you can also run a rc.c. in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places following the program init and starts the first he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you would like to change it, then you can restart / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have done something, then you will start to reboot the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this file are no correct files. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stops init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written so that there is an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start this scripts out by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the K includes, the script will stop the argument stop. if it contains a S, the script will start the script.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to build machines for many purposes. I could be & eg; a server-runlevel have to run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; additionally, I could also have a user -Runlevel, that & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starting.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another index is simple, to be trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of availability Systems to one of the six runlevel to start this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also shift scripts between Runleveln or change the position within one level by changing it somewhere else. this will only be done when it comes out of its original Runlevel (or its position). this will not happen if they have an entry from the field of availability system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you move these into a new field. to copy them only to a new Run@-@ level, you need to select copying from the menu Edit or select from the context menu, and even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Sometimes the sorption number of an entry may not be calculated. in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries, before you can try again to include the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is no option to restore entries that were thrown into the trash bin. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to activate the various workranges (availability, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To shift one entry into another Runlevel, shift it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the button button to change the properties dialog. use the tabulator button to accept the changes in order to accept the changes, or press the Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu will require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets will be taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; changes will be saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the Standard Runleveling and now launching the machine remotely. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel on a reasonable value (3 should usually be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), then you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way, such as system services are started, simplify the configuration for proprietary components in these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution: please check if all configuration files are present, which are required from the respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just stop without message when their configuration files are not present or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about Runlevel, so that this manual may be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program, you can manage users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; read more</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save this. either use the toolbar symbol or entry in the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window is made of two carton cards, user and user list. to edit the desired user, or the desired group with double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog User and Group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some maps are displayed only if you have extended system settings (Quota) for users, a map card will be created, if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master.passwd are installed as specified in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card card password management appears, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as BSD UNIX.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card is only activated and initialized for at least one embedded file limits (Quota) and initialized (identifies the file ratia.user / quota a.group on the file system). here, users can be changed for each user, where the number of limitations are included in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using the help of the field filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The map groups informs about the users of the selected user. the default group to which the user belongs, you will find in the Primary Group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the big field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group's dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select adding the user or group or click the matching button of the tool bar. edit or delete the selected user or the selected group works similar.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO Bootmanager, add the bootpassword, remove and change the time to the boats of the default system, remove the default operating system, remove, modify, change, change and more.</seg>
