although I visited the US since 2012 at least once a year , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely big .
like many of my generation I grew up with American films , American authors have been dancing and operated with American movies .
in fact , this country had a very profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist , mainly because of an American film .
as 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gray Gar@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Letter , a fear@@ less rep@@ orters , who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of a oil Magn@@ atas , the Supreme Court of Justice to judge his interest , wanted to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
free to Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if this is the absolute truth , all others forget it is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admi@@ ration had only strengthened for the United States .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I &apos;ve ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming you can always be who you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people .
I had even written a very bad love story about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the tourism and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is to me , as he re@@ treats with his narrow @-@ minded .
he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks of a former college , and openly explains his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ American and Women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes , which he won with the republi@@ can election , was the highest number ever reached by the party &apos;s nominal candidate .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ lot person , I asked myself ?
I could not put Tr@@ ump and his voters to the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , takes people from all over the world , a deep believing man , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
Tr@@ um@@ ps are also not supported by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er , &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
the intoler@@ ance of intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity which I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr , who fights for life long , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
it fits to the dedication of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es who always with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped us to acc@@ ust@@ om us to the complexity of the American life .
then there were Andrew le@@ ak@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me a lot in my career .
these people and they em@@ bodied by them , they deep@@ ened my love for America .
while p@@ umping on his way to nom@@ ination Republican Presi@@ dential candidates , they offered me a stop and counterpart to its limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , white , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the argument with the idea that people have voted for tr@@ ump , because they were either shared his rac@@ ism and fan@@ atism , or because they were ready to over@@ see these things , almost the heart broke .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to describe the tr@@ ump @-@ voters as re@@ lie@@ ve .
to classi@@ fy the people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superf@@ ici@@ ally and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who deal with another way and think .
it shows people that their wor@@ ries and fears are not taken into account of the hec@@ tic changes in their communities .
could it be that those elec@@ tors , of whom most know are , for tr@@ ump , because they want to win the control of a country which she has disappointed ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to rise up a man who looks different with contemp@@ t on those who look different .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wh@@ it@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ m . ) . : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impact of white against all other eth@@ n@@ ici@@ ties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Word Game from white in An@@ mel@@ on to the White and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means so much as Sch@@ ej@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it was the big Van Jones , has exactly killed what America has done so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background is always mag , America welcomes everyone .
for this country , as his president , elected the son of an Ken@@ i@@ an@@ ers , whose history , as he himself says , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the choice of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is on the rod again , they say .
at all of this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a manifestation for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
the crowd responded with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ ared the crowd .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos play a square in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
have Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a man who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan chat@@ ted with the words : &quot; God be thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , the message said .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could find no more place in this new America .
and that breaks me my heart .

from the mis@@ ery to the stars : this Latin American children can &apos;t destroy their love for music by tr@@ ash .
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Instruments &quot; from Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero church in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
the music that is played at both places , not only the life of the children changed , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the refuse
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the outskirts of a large garbage dump just 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds apart from the nearby prehistoric ruins and of its world famous cuisine .
for some years the La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ en ) now plays in the community : a sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra , which with its musical instruments , has a possibility to overcome the surrounding poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the church , located in one of the poorest provinces of Mex@@ ic@@ os , is known for its drugs and abuse .
but this changed after a coinci@@ dental encounter with a French pilots who started a musical project and became a rare hope of hope .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , the local press not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laughing and playing with shining eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , Pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from garbage
more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village , which is practically on the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Turkey &apos;s capital - on instruments which are made of recy@@ cl@@ able waste material :
music with recur@@ ring instruments , which consist of local firm waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling works under F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez started to transform parts of the waste in instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate violin , viola , c@@ elli , contra@@ bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion that were all made out of the garbage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as the music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article by the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , reminds on the initial time :
first , it was very difficult because we had no space for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place where the parents knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was somewhat shown , which he had never seen before : an made of waste produced .
today , there is a complete orchestra , which plays with instruments from re @-@ prepared material and is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ mark Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) draws the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tons of tr@@ ash every year .
those who are living with him and from him are the poorest - like men in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
landing harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspi@@ rational acting from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
Pope Francis played his music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can fight illegal fishing effectively
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fighting wild fishing fights .
this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the publication is done within an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to joint use of contents .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already run illegal fishing in Liberia before the other coast of Africa visited Africa .
the East African countries were thus up@@ set up and slightly slo@@ ping , a criminal law of this species to their co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and Seychelles mobil@@ ised rapidly against the ship . they refused him to share one of their har@@ bours and refused to share it a fishing permits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that you just refused , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authorities . it is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it didn &apos;t manage to catch fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia , due to pill@@ aging of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 was founded by the N@@ RO stop illeg@@ ally fishing ( Il@@ legal fisher@@ y ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that were exp@@ elled from their waters back then .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries , who are inn@@ ed and work together . they share information and stand for each other , where it is illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught , is hidden due to it extremely difficult to resolve . thus , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
by deliber@@ ate mis@@ regard of existing laws , which should be protected by certain habitats and species , illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems may harm a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing once were hin@@ dered by bureaucra@@ tic hur@@ d@@ les , and also through the sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , these events occur nowadays in real time , with trace@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange or exchange licenses for example , breaking news to susp@@ icious activity or details that you notice or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very alert when they move on the open sea , via satellite data .
this enables the authorities to identify ships that fish in banned areas - such as such that suggests that a ship invites its caught fish on other ships .
ideally , such tests can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the way and perhaps , whether they have a criminal record .
countries who are against illegal fishing can be refused on the basis of such information , then that the ships cannot sell their cargo to their har@@ bours . and that they could not be forced to sell their cargo , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is financi@@ ally worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant dedicated to combat illegal fishing in Africa and also supported F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to win an estimated 20 million USD to lost revenues , which lose the eight members of the H@@ ISH trade show every year due to illegal fishermen engaged in East African waters .
East Africa has become one of the most productive tuna fishing items that attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world , including those such illegal fishermen .
these practices include actions such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , speci@@ fying imag@@ ery names , fish @-@ protected species and fish in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you utili@@ ze the lack of international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ disp@@ atch control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier a ship was illegal and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must@@ n &apos;t run my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and this leg@@ ale m@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
the closed front works so far .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ icious ships .
it has been exposed to criminal networks , which had spread lic@@ ences in Tanzania . there were ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has persecuted and found volatile ships .
due to its co @-@ operation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority on the fight against crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information about illegal fishing over large distances .
some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
he builds a system that should help F@@ ISH @-@ i , susp@@ icious ships in more precise locations .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed , helps maintain the illegal ships that love to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Duncan Cop@@ eland , Chief analyst at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO , which also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn off for example their automated identi@@ fier systems , with which they can no longer be accessed by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that connects various sources of information . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ ating ships with larger precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team from African nations actually influence over the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ anus Marine Reserve : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through the position of any trace@@ able ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sp@@ amm@@ un with the neighbors , to get a better picture of what is doing - that &apos;s simply meaning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and consoli@@ date their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts have to run a similar project with which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only det@@ ective , but they also re@@ loc@@ u@@ sts .
ships that were f@@ ished with license previously without license and barely related with consequences , now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have now accounted for a 33 % increase of fish@@ eries , since fishing boats have more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow@@ ing , whose use is forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strongly that we now copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually disappear through illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , six countries have joined together to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they now combat illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the aim of leaving even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ ISH could report his first big triumph in Somalia : in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the road without a false flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and were not allowed to use tow@@ ing nets , which are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also prohibited in prohibited waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Acc@@ ept@@ ing of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they put forward a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collabor@@ ative work for protecting the oceans actually works in the entire world . Emma Bry@@ ce is freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about the subject of environment , technology and nutrition .
her articles will appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , T@@ ED Education , The New York Times and The Guardian . situation in Venezuela is now escal@@ ating : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of taking &quot; the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are considered to protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the revival of the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela had rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Vene@@ tians responded to the political and economic crisis of the country in which they were gathered on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( example : the response to Venezuela ) can be found in both images of these demonstrations and arguments against them .
the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ lands of MÃ©@@ rida and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the centrally @-@ north in the federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation deterior@@ ates continuously , making it noticeable in everyday life of the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans through an acute short@@ age of food and medications .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change , but ultimately , a re @-@ election of a re @-@ election was blocked by official authorities .
Mari@@ anne DÃ­@@ az , tribut@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the government &apos;s context in their latest articles :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , which is estimated to be the highest level in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and extensive lack of nutrition and medicine was considered to be the only way to return the country to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and close a new government alliance .

the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
it is far from Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil war and on 3 November all to Caracas at Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace .

the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Program &quot; Ret@@ rie@@ ve Venezuela &quot; was held on Wednesday , 26 October .
the pictures of the fair@@ yt@@ ale , published in real time , bear witness an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disp@@ utes with polic@@ emen as well as supporters of the government .
one of the most often shared images shows a prot@@ esters that calls through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me , because I have hungry ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I have hunger ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he cri@@ es in the Vene@@ tians . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , images that speak of disp@@ utes , as well as reports from oppression and abuse .
especially large waves beat the news about pol@@ ishing oppression in the central north @-@ north city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , the prot@@ esters moved back into the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed advoc@@ ates .
hours later , they could safely leave the cathedral again , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police force , including the wife of T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not wear a skir@@ ts because you could see anything else that many nation@@ alities have not seen !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic illustrates the round , which forms the extent of supp@@ ression per day :
so the dictatorship re@@ pressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a request procedure - this was now proved in the eyes of many of the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ d@@ ado claim that 1 % of the signatures are fake .
here is your official revival !
on the road !
other notable protests as further step in the fight against a government carried out little against the disast@@ rous economic crisis , making it rather busy as critical voices :
they took us so much - but the fear !
the fair@@ yt@@ ale are increasingly taking more frequency and intensity .
some Vene@@ tians reported the media , they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

this is an adap@@ ted version of an interview of Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argentine news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of CÃ³rdoba .
meanwhile , in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in Cordoba , Qui@@ j@@ ano said to his father .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , were committed to crimes committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not find his life .
starting with the burden , the same name as his father can carry up to brutal military operations at the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years , he retained the confidenti@@ ality for himself .
in the situation , I believed that it was fine .
I felt like a secret .
as a child , 15 years old you don &apos;t notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time , I could not realise that my father was a thief , the Fol@@ terer and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano , was G@@ end@@ ar@@ eri@@ e@@ official . during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , his father was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in the La Per@@ la prison .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor , who is charged with kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had seen the extent of atro@@ cities which he had seen as a boy , and who testified before a Federal Tribunal for his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent over his child and how this child chose salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there , I had friends with a boy who made mar@@ tial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you were delighted with one of the ERP .
don &apos;t mind that they will not run one day and I must save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation supports Ej@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers &quot; Party in Argentina .
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back into the sports hall . some days later he took me with the work on the military base .
he told me , I would become secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . because so my father moved me .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : University notes , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , propaganda amat@@ eurs , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ the prisoners are tortured &apos; .
my father took me four times after La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
during the first time and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he ordered me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great c@@ lot of silver .
on that day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ rack where the stolen objects were shut down and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed at an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I saw in , and saw a song , being tortured on human beings .
it looked like a field bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they secured an end of a cable . the other end of the person was strengthened on the body of the person who was straight there .
they gra@@ bbed a person with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ threw him with water and hunt for a load of 220 volts in the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch inside was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty win@@ ch .
years later , when my father was placed under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forgot this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much harm to another man ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were fitted with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and bore eyel@@ ids .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who also was charged in the process ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a series of matt@@ resses , on which naked people were bound up with the face - all were bound by hands and feet .
near the entrance , people quietly placed on the matt@@ resses .
when my father re@@ marked that I saw about the prisoners , he said , What do you see , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why did you kill me otherwise ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and was buried by soldiers .
I know this , because my father told me home .
besides La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms , which were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed .
( according to the survi@@ vor of the civilian , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who also was indicted on the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera Process , the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emilio Fes@@ sia , the leader of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the path that you came in here is also the way where they came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this route and tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed , and they were assigned to a number as part of the process .
when they survived the acts of torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order came from above , that they should be moved .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; Mar@@ ks &apos;
my father brought all the possible stolen things home .
at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later on the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war yield is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps number of military signs that one assumes a enemy who has fought .

but if one walks into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then it is not a war yield but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the head of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything therein .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a crime , and I answered and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Are you looking for cars on the road ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded anger , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and embrace you .
we don &apos;t need any others !
so my father was .
I have not a very good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photograph of that , on which I wore a jacket and a wheel pul@@ lover from wool . I had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothing to home .
at that time , the defence accused me to have been a prisoner of this crime . I said no problem , they can put me on the burden of what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to tell it .
&apos;@@ The disappearance of the body is the last vile act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . if one has only children , you see the value of a life .
one develops and recognise that it &apos;s wrong to kill .
I even went to say so far :
well , so you expressed ex@@ ek@@ u@@ ated during the dictatorship . but why leave the bodies disappear ?
why to release children ?
one day , my father had brought a girl with her home , whose mother had been killed .
it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
they could simply have put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why leave their bodies disappear ?
did these people not also have families to whom one could get their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ h@@ ous act , which one can do to man .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they sent machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
they were dist@@ ressed and somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything remains of course always .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clear it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the idea , signi@@ fying my father , was created during a conversation , when he was placed under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities which I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt very embarrass@@ ed and asked me what the entire patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; western and Christian emotions , &quot; which they were supposed to defend themselves , were actually good .
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crime , and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , I show myself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I made the first display .
I was finally recognized that he was a criminal .
no one can submit to me that I am pre@@ heated . I finally told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest still before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , un@@ lawful ar@@ tis@@ ation in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 cases , torture with subsequent death sequence in five cases , and a case of kidn@@ apping under 10 year old child .

the jud@@ gements in the &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the mag@@ nit@@ ude of the judgement .
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera Process ended due to crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August and December 1978 .
43 subjects were found guilty of crimes against humanity . the court hang@@ ed life sentences in 28 cases and in nine cases of prison sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ al .
eleven of the 54 accused died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ sia judgement : murder , torture and rape by officers . # Es@@ war@@ heads
all the accused were members of the military , including former military nationals , former senior citizens and civil employees .
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kidnapped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human minds .
the tribunal is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years for justice for years .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the 1995 Argent@@ inian organization , H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , representing the children of people who were killed or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ in@@ ean government adopted the country on which La Per@@ la was a memorial to be built there , which is now managed by human rights organisations .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot;
the sign with the translation error on a Centre in Kyoto , where you can extend his driving licence .
the photo was spread in the social media .
processing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving licence in the last month of witnesses , a very special translation .
on a sign the Japanese word ( co@@ rei@@ fen@@ sh@@ a ) , the &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; means , fal@@ sely - but perhaps also with mal@@ icious backgrounds , and # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; translated .
the wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September to read all electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
machining the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was divided in the social media .
the mistake had fallen to the translator Julian Holmes , a population of Ky@@ ot@@ os . it was also that the Lok@@ al@@ lo@@ ids attached to it .
the daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n in Kyoto wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation .
this is an ins@@ ult for older people and in an international city as Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; Holmes said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the defective English translation was removed initially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the expression &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture denied to the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the mistake had already been included in the text that they had received from trans@@ lators and that the translation was not checked up before it was published .
a blo@@ gger was reported as follows :
&quot; we are sorry that older people felt uns@@ us@@ eless ( the translation ) in our part , &quot; said the police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News sat down somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ orists . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are deeply involved in accidents , but certainly cause to worry .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example , 1.@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents by senior citizens . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , the sen@@ iors 1.@@ 80@@ 3 caused a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of sen@@ iors caused accidents in the same period have increased .
the rep@@ lic@@ ally called rep@@ orters led to the published version of article Comments on the light which show pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese seem@@ ingly against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo on the translation error received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; dre@@ ad@@ able mot@@ orists &quot; ) about the reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why is &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; in Asia so widespread
translation errors are widespread in Japan and in Asia .
the page En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for this bizarre bug in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of trans@@ lators are diverse .
for excess , one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source language and active language skills to transfer him to the target language .
the latter requires the active behavior of the target language - something that is in the case of native language . in general , the conviction that trans@@ lators in the target language should not be in the initial language .
a French mother tongue should translate for example from English into French - not from the French into English .
photo by Flick@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese firms do not employ workers with English as mother tongue , who could make translations into English . this may cause lack of understanding of the surplus , expense , or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies that have no foreign employees do not leave translations , but then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , become a translator , no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo by Flick@@ r user Karl Baron .
mach@@ elle translations are also widely distributed - often with fun results .
those wor@@ ries and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences develop through mach@@ elle translations , show that this technology can not replace a human trans@@ lators for a long time . this applies to some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English formulation in Japan , among them also the en@@ ig@@ matic prints that often have T @-@ shirts or po@@ ckets , are only used in cl@@ ist reasons - not to read or even understood .
photo by Flick@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable as jewelry still acceptable or at least harmless . but of big companies or from the government who have the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
in the future , Kyoto uses a serious source of translations in the future .
Venezuela : protest and interest action on Internet and television
Home page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Frei@@ es surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ elan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online transmitter Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later on , other user wrote that the Internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV are also not accessible .
other online stations have also recorded recordings of the protests in Caracas , organised by opposition groups that opposed the Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
the protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos DÃ­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out to take advantage of users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Z@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ elan providers are locked once again .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ers with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since 2014 , traditional media has been hes@@ itated on protests since 2014 . back then , the Commission plans to report with money fin@@ es and closure , if they continue to report on demonstrations by the Commission , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Call for Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without a cable TV and informative national television channels I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is surprising that this is still cheaper than to buy two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO De@@ ad@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online transmitter . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly carries their meetings .
earlier studies of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet operators can sometimes use DNA . this is a technique that answer the DNS @-@ server requests of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by DNS , the server respon@@ ds or ref@@ uses the request to call such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ ap@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the transmission was stopped on Thursday , April 6th , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cameras Elvis Flo@@ res , who had survived the protests in Caracas , was taken into custody .
Flo@@ res was defeated , while he was in police custody .
eight hours later , he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again .
although some channels still have access to YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : the Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ men will continue to make access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls are invited to slaves to get an apprentic@@ eship
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta child . now she visited the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collect Zeu@@ s of other Cri@@ adi@@ tas who were just like they were victims of mis@@ use and discrimination .

the following articles is the shortened version of a copy of a copy , published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , &quot; falling schools &quot; ) produced by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , in which it was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before gradu@@ ating at the University , she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride on her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas are called in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 young boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is quite simple : a big family with little money transfer their under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , more abundant family . in exchange , the child eats food , training and one roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned is that the children need to afford countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse are - and all this in the context of a contract you cannot raise .
this as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , practice is widely used in Paraguay because of its involvement and acceptance by large parts of society and despite many complaints of human rights organisations .
after completing his studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - he gathered witness , re@@ cher@@ ished and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call the things by name , as the feeling of gratitude , which is vacc@@ inated by Cri@@ adi@@ tas , will generally be silent in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double illusion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
then , on the other hand , the family , who close their daughter in faith that they improve their training , improve their position in society and can &quot; do something from themselves &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family that takes up the girl with him and justi@@ fies that it would give someone a chance that would not receive any training , and perhaps could even be hungry .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience many years later .
sometimes they never know them .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon that takes place in secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº arrived in the hospital , her body showed traces of heavy strokes . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the ex @-@ affiliated Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an officer at the population .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with 3000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ on .
by the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira suggested to Mar@@ Ã­n until it suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they empha@@ sized that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen society of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go company responsible for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest protests and demanded that there were no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she compl@@ ained Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the sp@@ ar and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded an investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was Cri@@ adi@@ ta was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes from court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be landmark when the first time in history is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go to court .
everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited for workers , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , she had to sign the bank@@ rupt@@ cy and lost his father his work .
their brothers had to work out all , and began selling sweets on the street or on the market of sweets to make money .
they went all further to school .
only Tina has been sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the capital of As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of its employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
so she had to share the time so that you still remained time for learning .
every morning , she stood at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
on Fri@@ days , she puri@@ fies the fridge , cleaning the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ infected flooring .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time for learning .
the sooner it was done with learning , the more free time she had .
but this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the househ@@ older than food from the fridge , &quot; she remembers .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the househ@@ older , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings , the house@@ keeper Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a came to stand next to him and leading articles from opposition magazines such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince her to give the reports of the official media on the regime of dictator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held them for intelligent , but not with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the master of the house had found someone who , while he spoke about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t allow me to visit my family , because it was the opinion that I would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; so they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ to speak at home again their native language of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they had the formation that they had made , again , explains them .
it was completely clear , however , that she had paid for everything they had paid for them with their hard work .
even in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; a thing that is almost never talked about , mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who cri@@ b@@ ans are exposed to school .
because the other children parents have , they immediately recognize that someone , who has no parents , is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I could not invite one to me home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clearly that I belonged to no group .
isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the company appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can view job advertis@@ ements for cleaning personnel and nursery schools in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administr@@ ator is P@@ EPA Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city dream in the district of As@@ unci@@ on .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter , who plays in the morning and afternoon with her .
learn to learn .
please tell you .
starting on Monday , if possible .
the display received five &quot; li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a fine @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman who came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
the third commentary was written by &quot; a girl from the national inner that wants to work . &quot;
then the author returned the display once more :
dear friends , I have found one . I look at if it works with her .
thank you very much , I write again when something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the Cri@@ adi@@ tas report , Â¿ Was ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long still ? ) , a collection of testimony of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ tiz :
in the course of our history we managed to abol@@ ish systems like slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( an economic system while the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ania ) and the native population of the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ als ( where the labor@@ er had to be considered a Hal@@ b slaves ) and to provide Spanish in@@ oc@@ tr@@ ination . therefore , it is not to justify that many girls and boys slip into a system of slavery during which they become easy victims of abuse and exploitation .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and that pose in power are the key to understanding the phenomena known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
draft bill writes Egyptian users social media to register with the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections recently agreed to &quot; agreed on the regulations concerning the use of the use of &quot; social networks &quot; on the use of the use and utility of social networks .
if he is accepted by the Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government agency to use social media , including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up to share social media to citizens and citizens .
within six months with acceptance of the law , users have to register with their right names and number of personnel numbers to use social networks .
if it fails to do this , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six par@@ agra@@ ph@@ s , and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which is running and used by others to communicate with other voice , video content and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced , because the draft is no indication of how Egyptian authorities should make the registration of the registration . it is un@@ clear that the Egyptian government does not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation at level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , par@@ liament@@ ar@@ ded and promot@@ er of the Law , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and password &quot; by the Fire@@ wall to get the Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to those would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians , information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not known to date that such plans exist .
experts in front of the site are skep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Technical Research ( in German &quot; Intro@@ duc@@ tive Research Technology &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt strongly of the technical capacity and understanding neither the authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine how to control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take it seriously , then it means that they contribute to a strong surveillance system to request citizens or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to carry it to a trial process .
that is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must initially be discussed at the legisl@@ ature of the Parliament and the Constitutional Com@@ mitt@@ ees , before it comes to the plenary debate .
whether his acceptance and en@@ forcement has been successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image of the image , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legislative flag against cy@@ ber crime committed in which a life imprisonment for those planned to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order to thre@@ aten &quot; and &quot; protest &quot; to protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north east of Iraq , the animal shake H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists from the NGO &apos;s non @-@ governmental organization work on protect the er@@ red Persian leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of leop@@ ards that strike through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are based on Wil@@ der@@ ei , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and as they find less prey .
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
as R@@ aza shows up in the video , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ ory in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a big pir@@ ate is present .
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ard in the wild game is low and goes towards zero . as the team has therefore noted that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza passionate likes to have a different side of their country , which consists of war and conflict .
it has been involved in field studies for wild animals and an educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is making itself that protection zones for wildlife areas are set up in the Kurdistan region .

in early March 2017 , the pro @-@ government daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress carried out in the past six years , were affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 , a massive earthquake , a tsunami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture was one of the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s North East that both had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbor@@ hoods of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced , because the tsunami had seized whole coastal cities by the map .
on this occasion , Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture experienced a nuclear accident , so that they had to leave their homes for 160 000 inhabitants .
the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local point of view , which progress made six years later , to establish the life of the local government .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( air @-@ conditioning , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to list 80 percent of the planned spare parts .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hima is the final light at 70 percent .
still , even six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald ( mar@@ tial , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) is still trying to re@@ settle in final spare parts .
almost 80 000 people were forced to live in discipl@@ ines after the triple catastrophe .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate .
almost 40 per cent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emer@@ gen@@ cies , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , who died after the disaster in heating plants , were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number here is 34 percent .
the stand of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours its operation resum@@ ed .
in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land , the tsunami and nuclear accident took place in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , but only 66 per cent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agriculture in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic accident , because only 690 hectares of 5@@ 400 hectares of ar@@ able ar@@ able land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the nuclear power zone .
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely again , but also Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains un@@ defeated .
tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back up to 90 per cent at the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , however , can offer only 75 percent here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is harder to earn their livel@@ ihood .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
to determine a total picture , the newspaper introduced numerous surveys under the native population and the ev@@ acu@@ ated by . she asked them about the state of re @-@ building and , as you can find out about the tsunami risk .
in her introduction of this article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the tsunami awareness among the native population in experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local population has taken measures to be prepared to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and tsun@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respondents think that there was still not enough disasters with disasters .
how it stands for those who ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture
in their edition of the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention as well as the position of ev@@ acu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima had also been a witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident , in Japan .
from 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were laid out in areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , slightly more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , had been res@@ ett@@ led in permanent spare parts .
after 2017 , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their country pre@@ fecture .
most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation areas are most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation areas that are still in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ son@@ hausen , older than 50 years old . it is more than 50 years old because the efforts for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are competing with massive construction projects . it is a construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that are to be held in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people find people from other countries that speak a different language , differences even seem to be larger than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one recogni@@ zes that more links than it appears at first sight .
these global connections are important as they demand our pre@@ judi@@ ces to expand our perspectives , and remember that the world is ultimately very small .
in this sequence of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely to these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast , we treat subjects who often get less attention than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders .

Brazilian activist in the artificial coma , after being assembled by police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva had a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit . last Friday , a police officer had sm@@ itten him against the head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s has suffered a skull @-@ trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on this Saturday and now put him into an artificial comm@@ a .
his condition is considered a critical .
the local sculptor Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures also the face of the police officers , who attacked with a striking attack . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
following the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announces that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the end of the incident of the incident from active service .
the pictures show the police officers like he strikes in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia and his impact on the face of the Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer ruled by a prot@@ esters and land on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen for six months in television and the entire oppression would be justified with that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ ul@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared video on the net , where you see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers and several param@@ edi@@ ts shortly afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another video with the same scenes , filmed from another perspective , is also immer@@ sed in social networks .
in the shown clip one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family , living in another Federal state , Internet users have donated more than 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( approximately 2.@@ 700 Euro ) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
to the police age . &quot;
the drawing has been shared several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activist in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political violence : here the activist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated . here , the military police had joined a What@@ s@@ App group , and now we have attacked the very sad case by Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who was attacked on the intensive care unit , after being attacked by a polic@@ eman , who struck him into the face with a whi@@ p .
police access
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police sales on Friday last Friday .
polic@@ emen were protests at the protests in Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
S &amp; D Euro MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to aband@@ on violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again the Brazilian media road prot@@ esting , the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ists l@@ acked : a window wind@@ shield .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo are targeted specifically to design a broken glass window to illustrate with a photo of its cover pages .
by contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred the title story with a brand @-@ standing coach .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken wind@@ shield than the protests of thousands who serve the defense of a special cause .
this must be recogni@@ zable if you are stri@@ ked against any form of atomic damage .
here too , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives a absurd , non@@ sense significance and the typical violence of the military police are caused by headlines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confron@@ tation with the police . &quot;
the Ab@@ ri@@ cul@@ ation of forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane mills contributed to the whole of Cuba &apos;s doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) .
the community community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known that there is no notable sugar@@ be@@ et on site .
it is two years ago , when the activities were laid down in the sugar cane mills .
after replacing the sugar cane industry in the region , and the factory lost after and after its facilities until just the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to be re@@ inv@@ ent .
some changes the work .
other autograph@@ ed and comm@@ utes to the factories , which are still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a sol@@ dat@@ env@@ elop@@ an , which is open every day at 4 : 00 AM , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not smoke his sleep .
he heard that there are in operation in the east of the sugar cane factories , which are still in operation after a long time , because they were preserved .
that was something that he was not expecting .
N@@ ene remembers exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar cane factory but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already with@@ stands the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the I@@ ne@@ ff@@ efficiency , the bad administrative decisions , and climate change .
production of 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the message would have been a motive for a few decades ago , but the bad earth@@ ed are no more news .
why was the Cuban sugar cane collapsed ?
the old railway platform of the church saw already better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar@@ cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar@@ cane mills were technically dep@@ rec@@ ated , and barely competitive , they were im@@ measur@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories , annual production targets amounted to 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories , which can produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar@@ cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis in the world market .
however , the sugar price increased again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 Report , &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; of the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and food organization of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately $ 85 million for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s Day will go into history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from there , the process of re@@ structure in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane mills , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as a soldier , is known about the closure of the factory , the word that he repe@@ ats most , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all of those surveyed are : not one of them informed that the factory would shut down .
so the place is preserved , they formed a full time - working group .
prior to the first year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially registered documents that would only be removed from parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ac Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve every dis@@ miss@@ al .
from then on , responsibility and letters were becoming more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the set @-@ down factory for two years , and he was one who had received the letters . &quot; the country had no money in operation for which was still in operation .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another complex , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he participated against his will at the de@@ commissioning of the factory , in whose construction he helped , participate .
with each part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and its main workplace was extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the work@@ places and services produced in the communities in which they were located , were created .
we will never know whether during the Mamm@@ ut @-@ speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then President in the eyes of present persons saw that he guaranteed for the opponents whose factories were no longer in operation for five years .
the price of the population for closing the sugar cane mills
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned to change many things , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane mill was closed , or even better , when they began to stop them , they also stopped to asph@@ alted the road to asph@@ alted , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories .
they have to spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region too .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production doesn &apos;t even serve for the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant remains impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma factory , the ruins of the place where he started working .
nin@@ et@@ und@@ forty years old men bring a retirement of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years retired in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr N@@ ene , a man black skin color , small , with a few teeth and clear@@ er voice , is not a rebellious person , but still for@@ gives the lies that they told him .
they have tor@@ ment him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes into retirement by 65 years , not because it is lacking in power , but because he is bit@@ tered .

first Nations Youth people use hip hop to express themselves and get their own culture
photo of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photograph used with permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
you@@ ths of the First Nations communities in Canada deal with topics that are important for them . they do with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour , mobile audio studios have been working directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked with the Cre@@ e hip @-@ hop @-@ group The North@@ stars .
the workshop increases that the young particip@@ ators in our conversations as &quot; cultural identity , language , argument , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; or whatever they will find in the sense .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where the young people are the leading actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia , and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the area of the pedi@@ gre@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; in which nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mostly not clari@@ fied .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video player to conv@@ ey how important to maintain traditional customs and customs , despite the influences by the glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always rule the languages of the First Nations languages .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ lean stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation was recorded , the refra@@ in will be sung at Cre@@ e .
the young people received a little help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars hip @-@ hop group that talked to them in the dial@@ ect of Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
at the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ site of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the St@@ anz@@ he is available in the inscription , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel , as nobody ever would be interested in me
but I try to go on earth for my days
that &apos;s the day you will take our terr@@ i
because we lost our way in life as a youth
but I think we will rise to one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and lead to our youth .
thus , they can do what it is intended for the creator

in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers that stands exactly on the menu , will be close to the entrance to sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( cleaning , &quot; plasma models of dishes &quot; ) of each dish , which is served in this restaurant .
the customers look at these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an entire industry dedicated to manufacturing this plastic dishes .
in the to@@ ki@@ oter district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there is a variety of these small companies that produce the plastic dishes , which the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so usual , they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is trans@@ forming today in show@@ y mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i series published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in the special sale : new with plastic shred@@ ded cell tapes as they are shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collecting objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in the ess@@ ences is increasingly cum@@ ulative .
in this case , a cave @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phone support .
we also have this part of the Tokyo train station .
and here is a Apple , which covers your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile @-@ cell support and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or nit@@ ro@@ l@@ lover is used , a popular bag , served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wow , cool , right now I can che@@ ated my mobile phone with laughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appeti@@ zing form , to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .

in reports , domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking &quot; in Mexico do not appear regularly in statistics . however , these reflect at all not the extent of the human tragedy that this battle brings together .
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , urged the stories of the conflict completely in the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the funeral or to the municipalities which have learned to live with pain .
standing behind every ly@@ re , behind every bone , in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never heal .
this is why the Mexican news portal animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ un@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug traff@@ icking &quot; ) that give this victims a voice and stories of people who advised the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime cannot only fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
for example , if business exclu@@ des because they are threatened by drug dealers and the whole municipalities have to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk .
pain of the Vic@@ tims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear life &quot; ) tells the stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who is hidden every weekend hidden graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost her father and two sisters , her husband and two of their neph@@ ews .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we prepare for the task of us again today , which we have asked to go , and to graves , by the people we loved to look for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an apprentic@@ eship .
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment , it has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t get paid out because they demand a death document .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get there ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid of fear . we have to show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
illness and Sens@@ ational journ@@ alism I already know for some years .
I pass every day at newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with pictures , which are actually only from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or ac@@ companies from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only person who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it acts as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if it is large . and it &apos;s also not normal that people listen to songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; from offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is , as if they have lost those who have lost someone , and those who are afraid that they had happened something like that .
I see our weakness , when stories become too naked in a statistic .
the alleg@@ ations of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village , that they were &quot; waiting . &quot;
I think they try to agree that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four Days Er@@ press@@ ung in the main city district : &quot; as a family has been pl@@ under@@ ed with threats for money from their business , until it was not only destroyed business by the end , but also their family torn apart .
you think about everything you lost and remember how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never passes away , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again , when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are removed from each other , the better .
she concluded its report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will ab@@ duct or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days if crying would dissolve my deep root up feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how to weep . I have to learn how to live with pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of the honored Generation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions such as : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
what is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Bryan is a father@@ less and he tells that he had to teach himself how to make an egg coo@@ ks , potatoes , tortillas , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells about the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom the whole lives of violence exists and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years ago , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father who had been shot by armed men out of a passing car .
when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Bryan was born in 2006 as a force by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of kill@@ ings according to the citizens of the National Security Council and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone the Prosec@@ ution counted 3@@ 103 murders per day . this equ@@ ates to average 8.5 murders per day .
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that organised the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the country &apos;s soul .
few stories are still living in the face of becoming a new headlines . this project reminds us of those who don &apos;t want to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ un@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; the data journ@@ alism project is called Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose goal is to illustrate the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traff@@ icking that has tortured the country in the past four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Sh@@ aring is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flick@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages about which he is linked , include images , on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment , in which it comes to elev@@ ate a rum@@ or or any fake .
but how is the years after something has appeared the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , ten@@ ds to pass on .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication , it has been used to conduct trage@@ dies that took place in Nigeria or Myanmar in fact .
this false copy of image and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - Do not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in the DRC , Myanmar and Nigeria .
however , questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank @-@ car ro@@ ared the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pping around and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country has been neglec@@ ted for years , thereby devast@@ ated . the roads in the region have become a dangerous arrow that had become difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the tan@@ ker dropped to the victim .
master@@ ing representatives described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses , including a movie near , which was full of people that illustrate the football world championship .
homes aver@@ aged and ble@@ ached bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were being burned with the uncertainty .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur users My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 2011 5 more pictures of the incident form the atro@@ cious scenes of this day .
above is an example .
it shows rows of stolen body , which are sha@@ ded on the ground while people are watching them .
but here the story is not her end .
over the years the same photograph was rec@@ ti@@ led several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but it may not be written in the context of the trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote ni@@ otic towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically of atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bus@@ hes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; nobody stayed behind to count bodies , &quot; said a inhabitants to Human Rights Watch .
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
based on satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be portra@@ yed .
the reason for the attack remained un@@ resolved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the Military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win B@@ oko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DRC occurred again , as it was wron@@ g@@ ly presented as proof for the fact and the extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ chief use of the picture from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mal@@ ting descriptions ; Africa Check has documented violations of Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a proof for mass kill@@ ings .
another step further bring personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in relation to supply arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge also joined the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar in Myanmar .
according to a ligh@@ tening , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported from the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following ones who brought these descriptions with photos from the DRC :
this picture comes from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab news page , which was fal@@ sely claimed in 2012 , the president of My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ an Being , monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , it had used the picture from the DR Congo to account this information .
the original contribution , posted on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organisations , the AFP as its source , had also wron@@ g@@ ly attributed to being this statement , but did not have the picture taken from the DR Congo .
the world wide range of false information
traces of this wrong coupling until the years 2011 and 2012 are back and actually come from all over the world .
using a &quot; reverse picture search &quot; you can see how much information can be exceeded .
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search@@ engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 images below 18.@@ 8 billion images , which are similar to 344 images , which are very similar to that of the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mask private pages , platforms of social media and communities as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded false reports , others have tried to un@@ mask the fake .
we have been using examples of mis@@ chief use and associated with the respective countries , on which side them had been published . by doing so , we want to represent the range clearly than by the language only .
several examples of the listed below are listed in some cases ( which were also associated with each other ) , several examples of mis@@ leading use .
here are some cases that can now be viewed completely ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : News Fra@@ mes .
country examples of wrong cou@@ plings of the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ coloured countries refer to pages or servers , on the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ si@@ tions are still available .
the countries in grey are examples that are available according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing samples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts Against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this post , a blo@@ gger from Quebec City does not only ren@@ ounce the mis@@ use , but also discussed the abuse of the picture from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria and further questions concerning the Inten@@ tions of the persons and the related trage@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ Ã¡n qu@@ em@@ ando a los Pot@@ ti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria , they burn the Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , the part of the Christian region is identified as the Christian region of the village .
La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica cited as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( whereby it is not known if the original report contain the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions according to the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , like this one who used the picture from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; have clearly seen any pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster , which contra@@ di@@ ct this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the f@@ law@@ ed use of the image since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , then transported by a post of US American , anti @-@ Islamic comment@@ ator Pam@@ ela G@@ eller .
Germany , 2017 . &quot; genocide against Muslims continues to be silent in Myanmar , Nobel Peace Prize winner . &quot;

even within Nigeria , the photo of the DR Congo was as a proof of the B@@ oko Har@@ am bombing squ@@ ad in Kan@@ o in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of an abuse of the picture from the DR Congo , on its part one Twe@@ et , the sympathy opposite the Nig@@ erian massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blog , the claims , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , as del@@ ectable , since the photographs were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government published a judge for what it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional messages and photos that came to create international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions concerning Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this correc@@ tions which only appeared in English only includes references to fake pictures of rum@@ ors that operate the H@@ ate speech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to put that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and elsewhere ( which is widely used by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which highlighted the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , is clear that the picture of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims , Christians kill .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ a is in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story out with the image of San@@ ge .
the article was updated 2014 and at the time of this publication , the image is still included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by now deleted , the Catholic near @-@ standing news page An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly stated that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims it was a &quot; similar fighter attack . &quot;
when the picture ran into circulation with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to contra@@ di@@ ct that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ j@@ ery@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ th@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning that sleeps ) .
the DR Congo has di@@ pped , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and caused a discussion among Muslims according to the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities took these events that were suspected in the name of the Islam@@ s , a greater attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was swe@@ ating as proof of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times saved ) . but the messages that were associated with that were no religious context .
instead , the goal was to raise attention to the relative numbers of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnamese ) , 2014 .
after a message that allegedly was written by a &quot; god@@ father Juan Carlos Pascal &quot; about the Nig@@ erian massacre was put into circulation , discussions like this here on Vietnamese and declared it to the point of fal@@ seh@@ ood .
from the message where the picture of the DR Congo was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ Ã­n Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Martos .
there are further confirmed examples of a defective use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
other accounts , ag@@ gregate and sites across the following countries ( at the portfolio in grey ) also shows the Tin@@ Eye , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entry with UR@@ Ls and Time / Dat@@ ak@@ st@@ empel exist on the Web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and occasionally they have some image files in relation to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared not only after the original disaster of 2010 , the image is eventually perhaps a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and Pictures
there are two strong topics or fra@@ mes ( ir@@ radiation ) that go through this po@@ ds . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in terms of greater discussions about the silence of the assassination of Christians by Muslims or Muslims - the assassination of Muslims - the murdered victims of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how African life is under@@ valued at a European or French life .
religion you want to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worthwhile to investigate how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when reading these images cannot give a longer faith .
with social media , there are zig people who un@@ intended to share the water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of false and counterfeit information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and lubric@@ ated the actual horror of what is actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar in Myanmar ?
the spread of non @-@ violent images has already been deb@@ ated extensively ( for example ) .
an argument is that the re@@ jection of images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern that non@@ violent images readers and audience Des@@ en@@ si@@ bil@@ ites and to take them the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study , who searched carefully , how to help violent media to help others ) .
while there are some to discuss the news media in terms of non @-@ violent represent@@ ations , the fact that it is essential for today &apos;s news coverage .
techn@@ ologists have experim@@ ented with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; you will have to think about situation in which a picture is slightly sug@@ ary , which can actually be replaced by context or in totally mis@@ sive way .
however , every study of false assur@@ ances should also be considered as international they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Simmons is used according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name of Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. in@@ explic@@ able ) stri@@ ves to offer voice enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world who are difficult or not to translate .
such words are available in every language : they are certain situations , or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these unnecessary words are already well known today ( such as the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example , Spanish so@@ y@@ esa ) .
but everyone resi@@ sts stub@@ born every attempt of simple translation .
one word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation , and sometimes somewhat context are necessary to understand what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a long time in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and Lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog you can find the example words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ch your parents in recognition of how you stri@@ ve for yourself in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ afe language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness that one feels , after the sun has become dar@@ ed in cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog above :
they create other cultures , reveal other thoughts and wake our curiosity .
sometimes , you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even more of these &quot; irre@@ cover@@ able &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
Red@@ ner of the &quot; Treasure Languages , &quot; which are greatly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favourite music here .

like Sri Lanka with the worst flood catastrophe of the decade
the island nation of Sri Lanka is at the moment of the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slides in this decade .
triggered by mon@@ sun , which usually ends at the end of May are caused by strong ra@@ ids the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya stepped into the south and west of the country over the shore .
following a statement by the civil war of Sri Lanka , 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people are killed because of the floods and mud stops .
over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe stay types .
the rainf@@ alls were left slowly on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waters dropped slowly in some areas .
health and hygiene rati@@ os represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still un@@ appro@@ achable areas .
the following images and videos conv@@ ey a impression of the extent of the flood catastrophe :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et deliver regular updates to high water situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s fatal floods wor@@ sen the crisis , warns Save the Children , after more rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood at high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also flooded because of the water buff@@ ered water level of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force took five planes for rescue activities and five five are made to transport staff deliveries to the flooded villages in their flooded villages .
various organisations and star@@ tu@@ ps have also declared to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od V@@ ICT@@ I@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about flood and humanitarian aid .

last year after the disaster of the trop@@ hy Ro@@ anu , Pick@@ Me brought a &quot; flood relief &quot; button , which allowed it to retri@@ eve a vehicle to pick up the aid of assistance and donations . these were then sent to the Red Cross for free .
similarly , they launched a &quot; SOS button , which resulted in more than thousands of requests and 150 successful boat @-@ actions for high water and land@@ slide included people .

use appro@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March 9th in San Francisco with a neighbor and love girl .
I trust her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts her children . she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we call for women &apos;s rights .
in the next season , we reserve rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ inn@@ ate par@@ ol@@ ises against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
my friend looks at me and says , &quot; These things do not relate to you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people , with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that built up in their performance .
they shook me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims around the world .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be Muslim on different art . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim shoe .
this drawer is designed in our collective imagination as soon as Muslims , who , as I do not fit there , had to be de@@ fied .
de@@ for@@ cing to be de@@ pressed
I do not stand alone .
this is even the poet that poetry in America is most sold : Rum@@ i .
which images come in a sense when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I was now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day that he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the western idea , religion is deleted by Rum@@ is , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this extinction makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of Muslims in the re@@ ac@@ tionary pictures of Muslims , which have led western books for centuries .
this cur@@ ative aspect is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the landmark Palestinian scientist Edward Said , in the 1970s , laid the story behind these images .
but these images are still visible today .
they continue to continue our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood .
I have worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I &apos;ve seen how this powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous nar@@ rative is domin@@ ate our new@@ s@@ feeds .
this nar@@ rative represents the reality that nine Muslim women have led their lands in the past three decades , while the United States did not even choose their first female candidate .
this nar@@ rative approaches to recognize that when French , Muslim women are ham@@ mer@@ ed to carry their head@@ scarf in public buildings and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same medal .
a powerful group prac@@ tising his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this powerful nar@@ ra@@ tively weak@@ ens Muslim women to guide the movements for change .
it sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American territory of Afri@@ cans , which had been taken here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer @-@ Muslims .
this nar@@ rative has occupied our collective pre@@ hen@@ sion , deeply and f@@ law@@ ed , often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children become the aim of an@@ tim@@ ental attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ans .
because of these stories , we tell us and due to the kind that we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
among the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry , we are doing more than just stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rative that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to en@@ force the nar@@ rative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here where seven million Muslims comprise the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the total Muslim population are African @-@ isch@@ em@@ ic Americans .

back then , when Khan was re @-@ thought to the world of Sky@@ lines , my parents were uns@@ ul@@ led Muslims and Americans .
but am I not the Muslim but American ?
sometimes , if people wonder why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes or make my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; made of respect of Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I am j@@ esting , we do not carry all T@@ ash@@ k@@ or@@ ans with us .
we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts in order to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected for additional safety checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who endeav@@ our to fight in widespread lies over Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ bia with money , think tanks and experts for counterfeit information , which is our already f@@ law@@ ed picture which is a Muslim ; or what Islam is manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell us and due to the kind that we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in more than just a fore@@ ig@@ ner , who breaks the head scarf with a woman .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ugly forms are attacking our affili@@ ation .

I want to explain that .
I was born as a Muslim , but was born to the Muslim , but I was four years old when I was four years old in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavi@@ ours are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , my neighbor , my rock in the surf spot that I am Muslim , when they could look through the 15 @-@ metre concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I kept them in my arms and you are called the Arab verses to protect the Koran and the Q@@ at@@ uls .
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask therefore that it is protected from evil , evil which can see and evil which cannot see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Muslim faith is possibly not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow .

to be , Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had said to me , if I have a bad day .
to be Muslim , as she taught me to relate to God , Allah Mi@@ an what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who , - over centuries - created by a &quot; Empire , &quot; which has formed a company with the name of ven@@ erable British Ost@@ ini@@ ums @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , has a deep meaning to call my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
approved use .
affili@@ ation means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see my beloved grandfather cri@@ es .
in the meantime he writes books about the modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan was forced to rule his family in India with his family , K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he had not allowed to close into his arms in half a century .
belonging to know is that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , whose families were disper@@ sed in my grandfather , col@@ oni@@ alists who shared the Muslim world as the risk of risk .
the Muslim Brotherhood means to know that in the past two centuries Europeans have been &quot; colonial &quot; to four Muslim countries .
it means to know that the first fly @-@ in @-@ bomb history has been thrown over a Muslim country in a century ago .
it means to know that at the same time , Grand@@ father of my grandmother , a Swedish , k@@ asch@@ mir@@ y of the British Empire , called &quot; dangerous &quot; from the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he was the first mosque in England .
even before they had planes , he travelled to more parts of the world when I was ever and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion , we are going back into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ invited history .
it means that four@@ teen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were spread over every continent apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , to pursue mass destruction in Iraq that did not exist .
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an American Muslim Brotherhood means to know that the suicide rate of veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that when a tragedy is home to the United States and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a history with a white assass@@ in .
it means to know that four hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al from a free black slaves .
it means to know that two hundred years ago , an African Islamic schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad , and brought into this country .
it means Malcolm X call an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people filled the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the nar@@ rative of 1.7 billion is more possibilities than a magic cubes , but is represented in the reducing branch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and to care all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals build on this branch of structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim regions that began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it is in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration , who takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that connects its borders to people from just the countries that it bom@@ bed .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which takes largely Arab and Muslims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are the wars we run and the bombs we cast to Muslim lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell us and due to those who don &apos;t tell us , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University showed a scientifically unknown picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 concerning the evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation we have to lead
we are too deeply dar@@ ing to reveal the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
we stand for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the er@@ ron@@ eous and dangerous expression , which we ste@@ er in our news inter@@ actions .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims in the media industry , tried to record our many times with con@@ jun@@ ct identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Some@@ thing , Say of Some@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ ano ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim Bad@@ Muslim ; the Fre@@ el@@ o Square about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , increased Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IST@@ AN@@ ISH , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

coll@@ age of the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global point in which we are in .
and this moment has consequences , which go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House .
they are exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown , because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other &quot; .
a few years ago she had not yet existed ; now they control large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the re@@ alities and the history that I was not aware , as I was so old now , as it is now my daughter , but that made me today in an unknown Muslim .
things I left here like a bre@@ ach track in my speech .
things that are perhaps rec@@ olle@@ ctions , because in all the inter@@ sec@@ tions that makes our humanity , likes to listen to a story where someone is made to another .
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversation in the framework of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia are held .
more than a hundred acade@@ m@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; structural rac@@ ism , &quot; and &quot; American milit@@ ar@@ ism . &quot;
however , these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools or we read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward Said , the man who has shown us how wars are led to be revealed to people through the affairs of the &quot; other &quot; in public imagination , four decades ago even Scienti@@ st of Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions , after the role of being aware and un@@ consciously doing the &quot; other &quot; as it is my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because he has no President , the chocolate cake is bom@@ bed , while he already has broken countries and &quot; to other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for nar@@ r@@ ator wants to preserve urban lingu@@ istic diversity
stor@@ yt@@ ellers , by Flick@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility , here and now , despite a speech barrier with someone in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the story of stories in their original language is a possible response .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird , the impossible blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve the language variety of great cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia , or Oak@@ land , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not to be passed to the new@@ born children .
for the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the world &apos;s languages can be avoided , if we create cities , accept diversity - safe rooms , in which inhabitants must not forget who they are to belong to .
while &quot; listening often to understand , &quot; check these events instead &quot; to listen to feel , to connect . &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ eller introduce their story first in their own language before and translate or explain it in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their dev@@ otion , and their representation that the listen@@ ers can be insi@@ sted on it .
they cry out laughter and emotions , as the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional history from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ ale R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou also takes the opportunity to explain typical customs of stories in their country .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the be@@ ak of the bun@@ ny and the P@@ avi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona of Zimbabwe :
after expl@@ aining the meaning of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked , &quot; How is this to speak to an audience that your language doesn &apos;t understand ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of in@@ genu@@ ity :
they have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organizers are hoping to expand this . everyone who are inspired by the project can contact with T@@ LS in order to organize their own history records .
Puerto Rico also calls for the US re @-@ en@@ forcement of sovereign debt
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , focusing on 72 million US dollars , various religious and bourgeois organisations participating in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the pu@@ ert@@ event@@ ual Capit@@ ol , the capital building of the capital , and went down to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was called by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the ne@@ ural examination of the debt ) and the Ã@@ kom@@ en@@ ian church of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ate of the re @-@ en@@ forcement of the debt also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico also calls for the politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies which are responsible for the debt of their corruption .
we call for a financial audit and an Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debts , with a firm , our working conditions re@@ mun@@ eration which acts in favour of the economy .
we will press and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found with sin@@ king retirement payments .
we require immediate action .
the island - not into the country &apos;s integrated territory of the United States - suffers from a serious financial crisis .
thus , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on the soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law relating to state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing public view .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the outside , measures will be turned without the participation and conviction of the citizens of danger to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration carried the name &quot; Night@@ ry for Light and Truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

the sy@@ mm@@ etry @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi is known for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , supporters and members sit down the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions which he has done for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference of digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , dedicated a event of the # Free@@ bass campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a researcher in France based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara RÃ¼@@ hl@@ ing , Managing Director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; ready books within three to five days , l@@ ases excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ ner ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) .
the book , published last year and is free here , contains a number of approaches to deal with the free culture in the face of the oppression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
this book would like to explain how mot@@ ions will be built for Free knowing and what the real cost is associated with which this is associated .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors , who are involved in the movements of open knowledge have worked on page to view over the ne@@ b@@ ula who gives us our new@@ s@@ feeds and to create something from our different experience .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteers , who has been detained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was painted by the Ad@@ ra prison in which he was sitting on October 3 , 2015 .
we have since then no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own fate , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we abandoned in this process of temporary fluctu@@ ations in this process ?
the Web@@ developer of Open Source and digital activist has been in custody for Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the Ad@@ ra prison , a non @-@ military facility to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court of his cell in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted by persons on November 12 , 2015 , who used himself as the insi@@ der of the Assad government and put them in knowledge of a alleged death sentence against her husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs and state remain unknown , however .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in creating access to Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project which founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps there was none of Bass@@ els cultural prototypes , more than the work that he started with a group of ar@@ che@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ wise of numerous civilians and mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time Bass@@ el was unable to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture that is not only em@@ med the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this stri@@ ving into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be inv@@ al@@ u@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el was able to un@@ lock this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life in order to dream of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el was brought to me English , even when he was already in custody .
I &apos;ve learned to read and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he has taught others to read and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other imprisoned men , as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without making them one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Warten ) , a commission that she wrote in 2012 to her husband when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together for a year together in the book .
she s@@ mu@@ g@@ ted the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arab into English .
the book is licensed free .
book cover from Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens at every visit ,
that in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace us ,
that any of the dangers are no matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I forget the pris@@ ons of prison
and I went in every detail of your voice and words .
whom I carry with passion for me ,
when your eyes say Le@@ be@@ am
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to get all the moments ,
and about your absence to weep and smile .
I convinced myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of Bass@@ el &apos;s arrest , G@@ ha@@ zi wrote :
a year passes away , my soul

I am in your cage ,
and you still are in the cage &apos;s monster
Bass@@ els story is not unique in Syria .
since the start of the protests in 2011 against the regime &apos;s regime for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , more than 6@@ 5.000 people have disappeared .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence by the regime , tortured or even executed .
until 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in prison since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
since 2012 , the Global Vo@@ ices community demands the release of Bass@@ el .
we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time .

the money came from public funds in the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately requested his re @-@ setting to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which issued the motion , there was no obstac@@ le reason for Cam@@ ar@@ aza , again to refer to its old item , as the company was no disciplinary procedure in his detention .
however , many citizens are not good for action .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned in an interview with the German Wave decision to set the director again :
it is a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP .
what we take note is that the company should have been a discipl@@ in@@ arian procedure against the contra@@ dic@@ tation .
the company seems , however , and caused no appropriate legal steps to use the relevant functions .
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behaviour as well as &quot; conflic@@ ting &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to one sentence and half of them served .
he could hold paid speeches and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
but as he is in@@ competent , he has unanim@@ ous to re@@ integrate into the company , which he helped harm .
consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly pay for his silence .
resi@@ sting !
bit@@ one Vi@@ age , Young Mos@@ ambi@@ ans and Student of Political Sciences in Brazil , the director cons@@ ulate no moral :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted it , I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded with such a way that the state has already been insul@@ ted so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ ality and serving the state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead of serving itself on the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state when hand@@ some it has become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source and the state itself , this man &apos;s tired , the pre @-@ charged and finally was sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was really rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ t pre@@ fers to remember the prime minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , remember that a thief belongs to prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison , not only for ever being as the first independent president in memory , but also as a sharp , cutting @-@ cutting and - next by said - proph@@ etic or@@ ator .
one of his most famous represent@@ ations , when he was energetic , confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man would be able to sell his own individual interest , even the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
an ambitious man is criminal &quot; criminal . &quot;
in Twitter , reactions also were le@@ aning :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment , he sat 10 years and came free .
and today it sets him the company in which he is losing money back , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Frederick Î±@@ d . ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 . may 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored lots of users to wrong
the Bur@@ m@@ ical word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means ch@@ ick peas or le@@ ases .

according to data from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social Network received their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ jec@@ tiv &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook makes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or an all @-@ out ( in bur@@ mes@@ ischer script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate language in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the as@@ cen@@ sion of radical nation@@ alist movements has given an extremely low con@@ notation in the word .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight for hate language in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word in itself is not automatically ev@@ oked by hate language .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that there were also po@@ sts in which they have discussed the use of the word , or doubts the use of his use , have been cen@@ sored .
beyond that , there are several bur@@ mes@@ ic words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spl@@ ash &apos; ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; cal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ zer A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a spiritual manner , whether they would like to use his back pain by making a word play .
the phrase ku la - &quot; Cure &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will reduce hate language , radic@@ ally nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook has to be analy@@ tic before it kills all po@@ sts that will spread rac@@ ism in sus@@ pic@@ ion .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it fil@@ ates the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing on Fac@@ eb@@ ook .
what it should do instead , analyse the post carefully and check it by checking the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spl@@ ashing belts ) .
the good is that these three nation@@ alist nation@@ alists , the hate language , will receive a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circum@@ cise their nation@@ alism .
while the action likes to send a powerful signal to all the hate language , the efficiency of this strategy may not hold long .
the experience of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ orship is often called a cat@@ ch@@ - and mouse game , where users can simply start social networks to express a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to er@@ ase his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned by the social network :
... when I was aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I got the li@@ ken , post and sharing content for 24 hours , because the Post &quot; says the Facebook Community standards . &quot;
Facebook has a wide variety of posts from people who have no negative inten@@ tions or just try to show their opinions against the Hass@@ elt radic@@ ally nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed , which has nothing to do with hate language :
next post @-@ hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are po@@ or@@ ly in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook before the initiative were to have done more , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community said to ask :
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work .
those words to zen@@ ith is only bringing even more hatred within the various communities .
in addition , it seems as if they have started without local context or technical support , and have banned words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; her@@ edit@@ ary cur@@ ry . &quot;
even when they found out that they had made mistakes , they tried not to rec@@ ti@@ fy the f@@ eit@@ ful post@@ ings .
if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits offered to them a big turnover , that would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship has donated for much mo@@ ck@@ ery among the users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now aware of Facebook and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook post@@ ings that contained no hate language , but nevertheless removed :
permission to use .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch peas cur@@ ry and watch an Indian movie .
just to try out if Facebook removes the post which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot;
screenshot is used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate language in social networks may include violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the territory of Rak@@ h@@ ine where the conflict between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to bring out the out@@ dated Hass@@ elt on his bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control , critic@@ ised .
but instead of zen@@ ith the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to learn more in context than in code concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is at the end of the day@@ time
a wedding ring in sand .

the children &apos;s toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament &apos;s parliament unanim@@ ously agreed a law , which is to offer this practice , so that the hei@@ ght@@ ful age is now 18 .
prior to this change of marriage and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 there came to a large public out@@ cry . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state could not inter@@ fere when that , at age not the maturity . &quot;
this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contrac@@ ting partner of the United Nations Children &apos;s Rights , the min@@ ors as , to every man under the age of 18 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 indicate that the proportion of children who had already been married at 15 in Trinidad and Tobago were 2.8 percent , and 18 were 8.1 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , the country was confirmed that by 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online peti@@ tioning and social media movements that endeav@@ ours to abol@@ ish laws to children &apos;s before , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced by great support . without doubt , they helped me to bring this result .
nevertheless not everything went smoothly .
a Hindu @-@ guide , for example , had no concerns about saying the critics of the child , they ought to take care of their own matters . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition advoc@@ ated for tension in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and eventually some doubts came to agree whether the opposition would agree to the bill of bill .
but in early 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite four sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent that could be discussed - so that it could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
only the president of the country must agree and declare the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave us a status update which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted again on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill of draft against children was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and none of them decided .
after he had previously decided in the Senate , the design can now become a law .
the majority of social media users was thrilled , because the laws have been changed to children &apos;s before .
Facebook member , Lov@@ ell Francis , who used a minist@@ erial Office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary stuff needed , which has failed the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s love is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now , and that is nearly worth every price .
while Abel Jackson was in mind , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed to make the day finally arrived :
public Status Quo Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent news !
the sp@@ ouse has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , an civil society , which said quite openly about how important the adoption of the law is , noted :
the sacred age in Trinidad and Tobago is now ir@@ respective of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft for the change of marriage was approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives and were present 35 by the vote .
all members who were opposed to the law have voted for the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children &apos;s before is in Trinidad and Tobago no longer allowed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ fish .
many thanks to all activists who have fo@@ stered him .
congratulations .
thanks to our members .
but a possible h@@ ooks comes in the form of satellite Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary @-@ General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hindu organisation of the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and it seems to rede@@ em his promise .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney General Al @-@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law , thought that Mahar@@ aj would be justified against the law , the majority of social media users would wish to go differently to the debate on the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rell filed :
dear Sat , if we can say instead of discussing the discussion , in a way that can cause only panic and arro@@ gance , so that we , to safegu@@ ard the state into our bedroom , that they may be able to safegu@@ ard our daughters that they may be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ minded men , who are to be ab@@ used , would you then be willing to continue the discussion ?
or do you think it is not a problem ?
but if it comes to a court case against the law , or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children &apos;s children are legal or still remains the norm , although there are laws prohi@@ bit@@ ing them .

thanks to the reflection of websites , Turkish users can watch Wikipedia content again .
the Wikipedia page was published on January 18 , 2012 , against the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA copyright legislation in the USA .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month the Turkey is now making the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day for day is more clear , how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and fans and fans of TV series fight against the lock .
although many techniques have used to use internet users ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN reward in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users will not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been subject to Wikipedia for 2008 by Wikipedia , as recently published in an published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University have been adopted since 2007 , after Internet Act ( Nr. 56@@ 51 ) , the Internet Act has been adopted .
in China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ orship by Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , several Mir@@ r@@ or@@ pages ( pages , which are mir@@ ro@@ red the content of Wikipedia and often is updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator machines ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus making a complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult .
the content is rep@@ ain@@ able despite legal ban .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( about the di@@ stortion of Wikipedia ) we put everything on snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so , the opportunity to read the content on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed way .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the site www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.org .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was run independently from the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ pa@@ pe@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror site of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to ho@@ ist similar to Mir@@ r@@ or@@ pages if it is locked in the respective country Wikipedia .

it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
it is access@@ ing another URL that is not the original one . that what you can see is from Wikipedia .
essentially the server re@@ direc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to attentive to the need for nature conservation .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly placed moti@@ fs and full colors .
the motivated him to wear a camera and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nept@@ une , stri@@ ves to bring to the international stage .
and his home village next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that drive attention to Nep@@ als .
he described on Facebook as described this first @-@ class situation in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) had called me . he had a call from my father that would be a Leopard on the sho@@ res of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river D@@ am is just a few minutes from the tourist resort Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him , and showed me the place on the other river , where the leop@@ ard was and I immediately started to kne@@ eling pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar is stri@@ ving for cooperation with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ als Nature and wants to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not so frigh@@ tening as they look like .
and he should know it , for he arose from face to face to face :
a tiger can &apos;t inter@@ fere with the opinion of the sheep in sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
even I was at home because of the darkness in the way home when the King of the Bu@@ ec@@ ks appeared . he immediately sets up , and he st@@ ains away by the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) to his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als Nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent in order to make in Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ ter . it lasted until 12 days until he was able to photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist arri@@ vals .

years after the wedding was Indian women for the first time to pron@@ ounce the name of their husbands

this post was written by Kay@@ on a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India .
a revised version was published here as part of an content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , avoid women with greatest care , the names of their husbands , or even of older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns , or say &quot; Father of my child . &quot;
Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h give women that they should respect the husband due to social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences , they should su@@ stain the norm , this practice is alive .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced from the Indian state of O@@ sc@@ a by a p@@ seudo @-@ court and rep@@ ul@@ led by their family and the village community , having addressed a secret relations with names .
the tradition of their wives also not to name them by name , is also common among men . however , they have much less to be feared if ever , they shouldn &apos;t come to this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health professionals as well as house@@ wives , got a unique club and thus became a major theme in the city .
it is a place only for them alone , to discuss and discuss the enemy of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and sets up for the mining of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working for seven years with the help of their vide@@ oc@@ am@@ era at the coverage of practices , such as children &apos;s homes up to the prohi@@ bit@@ ing of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and direc@@ ts these clubs .
they reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women , and they played at the same time as ambassador of the wall@@ els .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion round , acted by women who did not call their husbands by name .
it has opted for this topic , because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
not to express the name of their husbands , it is a ro@@ man to keep it guilty to all obligations and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wish him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t hold this is considered a post@@ erior , as a woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never thought about this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who previously named her husband , had never been named after the name , try out at home , as it is running .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband are silent for a long time , after the video was at the end .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me , and said , I should name it from now on his name .
Roh@@ ini left her first discussion lu@@ b with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; nor before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , were protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , lov@@ ingly and so on .
then asked them all , &quot; If we can &apos;t say the name of our husbands , but they can call us as they do , means that they don &apos;t respect us ?
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of her husbands on the lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was out of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition who married women the name of their husbands &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that , during the whole exercise , it was so shy , and another decided to release the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family , to curse him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
in addition , in the ad@@ renal@@ ine exchange , to have broken with an ancient Br@@ ass , the women decided that they would actually try to name her husbands in their name .
and they held their word .
in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in the head : his wife could not stop to tell his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she was stub@@ born , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said that I should do . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understand@@ able and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini tells how women tried to stop other practices , such as the tra@@ verse of the no@@ d @-@ red dot on the forehead , which shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would carry the zin@@ ap@@ point , if he would do it .
he laugh@@ ed only and I listened to him to bear him .
the other women did not complete with them , but they think they are now in a better position , even to choose him not to wear it in some days .
for many women , the discussion group lu@@ b is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we do a trip at every discussion club .
we usually pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want to worry about women who could hear what could hear , &quot; she says .
in the last months , she celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in her life ; they danced , sang and talked about things that they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on this problems for so many years and I also have some things , for example , as our identi@@ ties are knot@@ ted on our husbands , never to be honest .
it feels great to say certain things to say loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we have talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have borne only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most is the okay , but some wanted to carry an Sal@@ ad @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a tro@@ users , they don &apos;t have we@@ eds .
after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes @-@ election , mor@@ als linked to the Sar@@ is and much more , un@@ g@@ gel@@ Roh@@ ini her own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round so that women could carry them .
next , they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will make it .
at the question , whether in the five months have already changed a little bit , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly getting into rolling :
we have made only small steps so far .
some women tried for a few times , but then we stopped to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , make it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands ; only one or two women are now wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead .
women in the discussion lu@@ b know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the rot@@ ting to more freedom of movement or their own clothing - at the end of a hard to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , you will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
as Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also there .
but this club gives us the confidence that will change something .
and I know it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if any woman goes home and other people what we speak about what we &apos;re talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

a new system of kidn@@ apping people for the organ shop , probably for aber@@ rations , wor@@ ries the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations into life to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and a part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and in the after@@ math they stood that the organs of Sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
it gives the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a bald man &apos;s gold can be revealed or wealth , the police officer of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia was the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks were registered at Mozambique &apos;s people in Mozambique .
another group , the aim of assass@@ inations for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , particularly in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and pre@@ judi@@ ces .

Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Ad@@ amo , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane in south of Mozambique said that the local police already lost the case :

a photo by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of prison@@ ed Chinese dis@@ sidents Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o held attention in international community , after his lawyer had announced at the end of June he had been hosp@@ itali@@ zed for liver cancer in the end of June .
in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison because of &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state threat ) , having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o which calls for the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Department in China described Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spokes@@ man told that he considers it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China will continue to call up calls from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , ti@@ mid@@ in Liu X@@ ia , or allow him to allow for a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out of the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
index R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu .
a speaker , however , refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to facilitate the treatment of Liu abroad .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Bren@@ de have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway , when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu , even though the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations continued to be resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to restore the salmon factory to China , as the exports have been blocked since 2010 .
after the news had spread that Liu knew seriously , the Nobel Committee brought his hope for a conditional release and invited Liu to pick her prize in Oslo .
due to his detention he was unable to opp@@ ose his price .
Liu was represented by an empty chair during the ceremony .
European Union
on 6 July the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was promp@@ ted to free Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allowing him to seek medical support , where he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for China to release the release of Li@@ us as they announced in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we anticip@@ ate that China lifts all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all visits , which they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States
us ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad told that the Americans said &quot; him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad , if it is possible to help him in his satisfaction . &quot;
a spokesperson for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the message agency AFP on June 27 that the message to release Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also to free his wife Liu X@@ ia from her house arrest .
the US Embassy &apos;s request drew a ra@@ ging response from China to himself , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department , that &quot; no country has the right to en@@ force and do not answer any other comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom such as travel agents and access to medical supplies of its choice , which they have chosen according to Chinese Constitution and legal system , as well as international comm@@ itments .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision on Congress in order to release the Chinese government to un@@ load Liu and his wife .
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally , so that it can &apos;t be used in proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany , Germany
on July 3 , Berlin , the German government loud@@ speaker Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote that Liu &quot; has received all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot; should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on July 7th and 8th at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing the news agency Reuters , that China had great concerns whether the turbul@@ ence could be over@@ turned by Liu &apos;s visit in Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China promp@@ ted to provide Liu a reasonable medical care and to give him the opportunity to worry about his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AFP that Li@@ us wife , Liu X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that Liu &apos;s not allowed to contact with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um rec@@ alls more :
Canada calls on China to under@@ take its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , to preserve the rights and exercising this rights .
France , France
French Foreign Ministry required China in a statement on 29 June to release Liu from humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o gets all the treatments that he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family may have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country , the State Department announced that France would have no further information on whether France will eventually receive him .
Taiwan
the council of foreign affairs in Taiwan called for China on 27 June to release Liu and demand a greater tolerance towards those who demand peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling party party also called for China to allow the ill intellectual Liu to treat himself in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself in a statement on June 28 at Liu very worried and gave evidence that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us Well@@ being .
he said about Liu :
it is my faith that the initiatives he took , and for whom he had been punished , led to a harmon@@ ious , stable and weal@@ thy China , which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt personally really moved and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
Singapore is a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid , since Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state .
but according to the Ministry of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am should visit Singapore as a town .
this remark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the Minister said that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supported that Singapore was to be considered a town .
... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy ...
this is , where most people go a mistake .
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rotate the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing Auth@@ or@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable land , we say that we finally have no country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the note of a flight before the responsibilities , a must @-@ bre@@ ach .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons led by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very noble : he defended an idea , according to which one could measure the political system of Singapore not with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of its , he appeared un@@ objec@@ tively un@@ democratic .
in contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco , or New York should be compared , alike cities which are run permanently from a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re from the authorized mach@@ inations , the proposed demo@@ cr@@ ats , abandoned logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the end of the last week , the Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ g@@ am last week were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judicial system , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he clo@@ aked appropriate questions with non @-@ replies .
Rachel Z@@ eng tells Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am to illustrate his mind as they did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , so the country belongs to our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
I would be very grateful if our wer@@ der K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take on the effort to clari@@ fy this point if it was paid up , in order to be part of the government of Singapore .
by posted on the blog his comment , he points out about the reviews that it should start to read the entire presentation of the conference , so that one could understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am better in which Singapore was a town and no country .
read the tran@@ script .
when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he declared that the elections in Singapore were so un@@ equi@@ vocal , even if we are looking forward to open and just elections .
he moved to Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
when he said that Singapore was not a country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t believe it in this sense !
Cle@@ ment T@@ an illustrates his dis@@ appointment of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who is a leader of a her@@ edit@@ ary generation that makes such pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I &apos;m talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said very much ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Guard which expected me - do I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes it is correct , and what he is aware of what he defended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review proves the vulner@@ ability of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams Arg@@ uments :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; credited a mistake &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ dle ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are considered as independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country the sovereign rights of the city go back to Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equal to land and city .
as he plays an important role within the government office , the statements by Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapur represent their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay our prime minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of one country , or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to visit Singapore , the journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade is always a town :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this proposition seems to have a lot of Singapur to have anno@@ yed ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a town .
we were always a town / island nation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that &apos;s not quite right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should say more of the defence of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the My@@ th of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screenshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ sive aspect about your home or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of a ongoing series , being revealed by rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world and a other fac@@ et should be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thompson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is asked to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , sorry , I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation is taking place , it is considered polite to show interest in his conversation partner by answering personal questions .
in my clari@@ fication then the standard answer is : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook perhaps even in anger when they are kept for Americans , but anno@@ ys me not .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag visible well on their ruck@@ sack if they are travelling .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
by contrast , Americans ... .
so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always worn small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
gay mar@@ riages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everybody seems to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada also applies to ethnic groups as the toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like those types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends I admire very much .
it would make me nothing , if one would change me with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first : as &quot; nice &quot; to be called , is basically to be sp@@ inning - like the good@@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has a very own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) .
if Canada would really be a nation of people like N@@ ed Flanders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing at which one can pier@@ ce .
be harmless , means in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous , and un@@ interesting to earn no attention .
that can be something good , if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , far from the things that are going around .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and to be alone , a master of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own matters .
as an out@@ si@@ der than &quot; nice , &quot; maybe just cool pol@@ iten@@ ess .
Canadi@@ ans do not talk about the fence with the neighbours .
we are missing the warm , open kindness , which I now connect with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Justin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice &quot; and our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zes Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop band has released a music video that took power the Jun@@ ta to restore power in 2014 , despite their promises to restore civilian government .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells his rules his girlfriend .
although not expressly politically , the music video refers to the persistent military power of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other sites for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for the song was a huge success .
within the first three days the video was posted on Facebook uploaded video 1.@@ 254 and received 8,@@ 800 lifts .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin Video &quot; dictator &quot; in Thailand had even blocked the public after a group of activists presented the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai politics , as special as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
check out these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand have been be@@ ating in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which makes the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army &apos;s absolute decision on important national issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; establishment of journalists &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are regarded as a critic by the jun@@ ta .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminal , whose vag@@ ue and un@@ clear provisions are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , providing online content and individuals who were accused of having s@@ lan@@ dered the monarchy , prosec@@ uted criminal law .
Thailand sets a strict observ@@ ance against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ esty &apos;s Under@@ standing ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the mar@@ tial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that Jun@@ ta continues to purchase their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts are warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax v@@ eins .

the post @-@ war society is re@@ covering only very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district .
now over 20 years have passed since the Georgian @-@ demo@@ lition war officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still very visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , atro@@ cities , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together for Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today live the largest part of the Russians and the ch@@ ases in the area .
such settlements are also called pi@@ ous cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here . today there are only a few hundred people in these viol@@ ins .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of 16.000 people had risen after over a decade .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey detached blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , which are called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ ch@@ ai@@ kov@@ sky , are symbo@@ lic@@ ally of the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it &apos;s difficult to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why ?
it is nevertheless unique . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens , which served all of the community .
now there are only paved street with amazing spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place , and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have now left the district .
in the town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live about fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages , it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v &apos;s K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , who still accommodate one or two families , can be seen in the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover the camera in the hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden ourselves to let us take a photo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers on her girlfriend and suddenly aband@@ on them demol@@ ished buildings and van@@ ish .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining companies called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in sub@@ sid@@ y ( cultivation of scenic products for the self @-@ demand ) such as livestock farming , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable construction .
it is difficult to get over the laps .
the District Administration is delivered in winter for free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ cchini &quot;
some ten years ago , an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
in spite of her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ es to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina wants to receive no financial assistance from her daughter and insi@@ sted that she does support her young grand@@ son instead .
g@@ inas &apos;s monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya tells us that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet a regular meeting and holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit us .
but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears in the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls her to T@@ aun@@ t G@@ alya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build cour@@ g@@ ettes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ cchini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children living in their house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she remembers the village of Dor@@ mit@@ es .
despite the relatives who live in central rus@@ sia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia only broke out ) , they did not leave the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently purchased land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administration city in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) recently .
we want to build a house there , but that &apos;s going to last another , &quot; she explains .
Nat@@ ascha is spending approximately $ 9 children for each child .
her husband works in coal pits .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens once was , they hold pigs , cows , chicken and chickens .
she tells us that at first , a very frigh@@ tening situation was , when many people left the village after the war .
but during the time , she lost her fears .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t be afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that this buildings were destroyed during the war .
but it actually has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone lived as it was right .
I remember every day , as the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation is bowed down , a little boy is passing over us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window , and another boy hun@@ ts him .
he plays with the ball , which then rolls down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
as they run , some of them cast stones to the falling buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , who care for uncertainty in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa is home to their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ ck was published on 19 April 2017 at our Partners PR@@ I.@@ org website and published here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Bra@@ ach@@ ula , he is located at the border of Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ erin , a small woman with a coral pink light frame and gold coloured ear@@ rings in ted@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Bra@@ ch@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian , who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ ble walls and beds made of metal .
in the entrance there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - even hundreds of African and hai@@ red migrants come here .
sometimes , Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells the people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; m@@ um Africa !
where are you in Africa ? &quot;
at present , it &apos;s more quiet but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside of boxes .
they don &apos;t want to reject anyone .
she also helps them to hospital , if they are sick , they buy them medication that they do not pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived before a short time .
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he respon@@ ds with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her , as African women are very nice women .
very loving .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have lived in Brazil , however , it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
the family had heard of other companions from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together the track and that , the Afri@@ cans already speak on What@@ s@@ App by Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
as many of his signs , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he began his journey into the United States .
he has been a member of Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez contact with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; he said smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests to send her often text messages when they have gone to salute them or to report about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have been taught to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only spark hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city leads a cu@@ l to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valencia .
this winter , Valencia and his family contributed to the migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and found that bus tickets will be sold to numerous African immigrants .
he started to help them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his home for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly shar@@ ti@@ ans .
some sleep on blank@@ ets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking area outside .
Valen@@ i@@ ela , he knows that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his work .
the majority of migrants traveling by Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to press money without a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he was asked for an accommodation and an unknown , an all @-@ wing , has offered him a roof .
a few months later , the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next step is going to go .
back to the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses the trav@@ ellers consult their teleph@@ ones .
today a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a majority from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but it is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
she leaves her album with a lot of photos in her album .
there is one of her daughter with African hair bra@@ ins that you made a client , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sad , while she introduces me briefly .
&quot; Ya &apos;@@ fu@@ eron &quot; is repeated every time every time . &quot; they have gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication equipment in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users , and that of the well @-@ known tur@@ ists
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July , the cell phone users received a mobile phone call in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi a cell phone notification , in which it has to install the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) .
in the message , it is said that the app &quot; is to ensure access to terrorist information . &quot;
however , the authorities will also use the app for more than com@@ b@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture because they had installed the app using a private We@@ Chat group .
in the police report that the app would determine the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective performance with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is the block of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , Trojan and ph@@ ishing sites to make users attentive as much time they spend online and control their own home network .
this app with filtering for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can be naturally used in a variety of ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; government or even h@@ ack@@ ers could ste@@ er the home network of a person to manipul@@ ate or steal it .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly concentrate on the experience of the users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict regions , the authorities often classi@@ fy extreme ri@@ sts and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ely Internet laun@@ ts .
based on Twitter based media outlet , &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( An under@@ going ) , the cen@@ sored news in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where polic@@ emen trained to examine whether they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification requested that the people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected on a check@@ point using a device without this software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they are forced to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by regul@@ ating technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( A@@ du@@ ci@@ ph@@ ony ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of the fact that the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system , and therefore un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council , to minim@@ ize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
all government agencies , authorities and with the party connected facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in operation of their computer and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , a US American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the order to all residents and entrepreneurs , until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard@@ disks , not@@ ebooks , and media storage . &quot;
the intention is obvious to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; this action , however , viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is , three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible delay , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
one single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo of : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ cl@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you trem@@ ble and tells you that you are completely alone in one place where all the most important is gone .
everything changed after and after dis@@ band@@ ed and revealed a truth that is clearly recogni@@ zable , both inside and from the outside .
one that makes his name honor .
one that has down@@ cast into a list of feelings and expressions that allow no met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when you look back the reality and look behind the scenes - across the theater , the beautiful scenes and perform@@ ers - turn the characters in beings from meat and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubt come up in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even though the Earth is on the axis of the monster , that you are captured here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone are built by stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as chief of the security services it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he put his power on us by proof , making it even the easiest concepts we knew .
five young@@ sters were killed during a peaceful protest like dar@@ nel from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to make the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all the neighbor@@ hoods sought after , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , rainy , at the wrong time , even when I found no high demands on a city , which is to be assigned to the arter@@ ies with government security and their ac@@ compli@@ ments .
during the third night the things had cal@@ med down , after the power supply had heard in the quarter .
I broke the silence , I shou@@ ted several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice in silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to meet together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we beha@@ ved in a splendid picture that filled my expectations and filled .
in such a moment you are aware that you are delivered the Spirit out of the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the barley .
I received a call from my father : &quot; get ready , we meet with the military safety building . &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice , after you get the whole way to the office of the security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was there , as I was now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an began to say : &quot; let me hear as you cry &apos; all ahu &apos; ? or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not near . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ted eyes spread to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re real to look at me in the eyes , not to the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps at the revolution .
I was so sure when I answered , &quot; I didn &apos;t think you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I have never stopped to look in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation , which could have such disast@@ rous consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret my word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is in sol@@ itary and his father like this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father is equal with this . &quot;
the st@@ ank of this curse lies between me and today in the nose .
he was sentenced to a &quot; syndrome , &quot; an economic torture that I was suspended for months .
I cry out the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
thereafter again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the individual cells .
I character@@ ise all details exactly before I managed the room .
otherwise , they have turned into a larger cell this time .
I have to share it with only one another prisoner , and I must put it right away , without waiting to wait for her permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I went back to a well @-@ tested communication method : with the fist against the wall .
I learned that my cell com@@ rade was a &quot; pure det@@ ain@@ ee . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
apparently , in no one of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged , which seems to be similar to me and &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness there is no striking facial features , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice is like my sounds ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers connected to its existence .
perhaps he was moved into one of the large cells .
perhaps he will be interro@@ gated immediately .
the investig@@ ators had insured me , they would be che@@ ated if I stay .
li@@ ars .
I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all those crow@@ s , who lab@@ oured in the fruit in my head &apos;s garden .
from the distance I hear it still &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; to scre@@ am .
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that Black saw the color of destruction , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Thunder &quot; , reference to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; they are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot;
that was the mystery to protect us and prevent the secret safety in front of us and prevent the terrorists in us , they talk in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational exhaus@@ tive card and betra@@ yed the tight view of its world view .
this is no house , which is no country ; it is a curse to name them co@@ existence to transform the crime of their cl@@ an into a hero .
I cared for the hearing and meet at Abu I@@ mad , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least , he looks like that .
he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the expressions that escap@@ es him , &quot; My boy , you are still young , you can set up so much weight with your life than to protest against you and to protest against demonstrations , which will soon be an end . &quot;
I don &apos;t answer .
I didn &apos;t get used to answer me .
I can really no longer say when ins@@ ults and beats after a friendly conversation have become an ordinary communication tool .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me told that I had to get used to get used to get punished , although I had done nothing to make this sentence .
at punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to plu@@ ck me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; confes@@ sion . &quot;
it begins with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your hen gath@@ ers your cry to your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure with him , and you cannot keep your terr@@ ors .
my cry did not make him enough , so why they exchanged the tube through a cable .
at my first start , I asked if the investig@@ ator had been a garbage collector , or if that was one of the normal working equipment .
they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined , to present us the , from their point of view , great invention of a huge Cab@@ el .
within a single hour , three of them changed while I was still in the line .
I had lost all of my body in my body - and my voice , which is why I heard to cry out .
the Hen@@ ker noticed the cooling down and did not find an appeal against it , which is why he considered a neighbour to an electrically charged rod .
electricity flows my whole body , enough to supply my entire district .
my semi @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect circuit .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty to this night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep back again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed that came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I reply with the voice of an in@@ exhaus@@ tible young people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My lord , my father has to make fear@@ ful sorrow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and get away , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they were always free .
where are they leading me ? !

but what you can rely on , a cigarette between his fingers or his fi@@ dd@@ les with nic@@ ot@@ ine lips can be discovered .
he lives in the upper floor of his family house which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year where Israel had finished its occupation of the West Bank and fled to H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family in which they lived in Palestine as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : Farmer ) .
for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activist , who has been transferred to the conservative majority , and asks their original opinions about gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ ies .
with his music , who often deal with subjects such as Orient@@ alism , rac@@ ism , and the situation of Palestinian poultry . all of these issues are not only found in his hom@@ etown of Amman , but also in cities that reach Damascus in Syria by far to San@@ aa .
with his 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking through boundaries and he can feel the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not open it , he swe@@ eps against the US @-@ American foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b doesn &apos;t believe his sympathy for those who are trying to survive in war zones , anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian poultry man@@ ners of the second generation &quot; - so he himself , even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own lives , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b stresses .
then he adds : &quot; I think that because I &apos;m a man , &quot; while he poured out the nest cafÃ© in two cups . it is the sacred month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in that time it is intended for Muslims to fa@@ sten from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also says that public consumption of food is illegal during the Ram@@ ad@@ an .
obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for it to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ ate hot Jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the slaughter @-@ warm coffee and the swal@@ lows of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose are primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when one throws a look into neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an to drink water - to not land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of the Interior has cancelled the performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eila , already for the second time .
some par@@ liament@@ arians who support the Islamic Act - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual front @-@ army Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ dic@@ ts the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert tab@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MP and former press for the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was cancelled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the sake of sexual orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many claim that the commitment of the band in affairs such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which represents the well @-@ proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the entire region .
in a public statement M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila said the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continued to continue to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is unlikely to be sil@@ ky rh@@ et@@ oric , but is actually an increasingly obvious reality in Jordan which occurs in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Werk clearly .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b came traditional ven@@ erable sex car@@ essing , having formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently covered , unknown woman , whose arms and legs are stretching to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of them they should actually trust .
over the past few years , the number of &apos; honor &apos; has risen - the in@@ official outside left in Jordan .
on Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ orary Ci@@ vi@@ sts reached its peak in 2016 , however , that Jordan was lacking institutional infrastructure to support women who tried to support the victims , attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a law to Crime Squ@@ ee@@ pers from 1954 , women who are subject to danger of inner @-@ friendly violence , &quot; and for their release is often a years of bureaucra@@ tic effort , as well as the guarantee of family needed , that the woman will not happen .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for it , also not shy away from issues that g@@ low in his country as a t@@ abo@@ o .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , however , is a dream that he can separate his music , which is full of explic@@ it attacks on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , cannot separate from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in@@ ex@@ pressing politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of Palestinian identity in attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; we focus on poverty .
the list of songs , which are politically , can continue .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , verse is repeated :
&quot; you are free , and every other is it . &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , on which one can get , in his words , &quot; it can get what you want &quot; - whether it is faith or not faith , het@@ ero@@ y or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that little one in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on gender equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still strongly cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b introduced an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an On@@ line@@ age Ro@@ ya , to mention that his comments were torn from the context , twi@@ sted and cen@@ sored in his opinion .
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without in@@ cis@@ ions , but only one worked version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b ac@@ qui@@ res open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance about homosexu@@ als do not speak to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ ys , a poet of the eighth century who still remained in remembrance today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ ys , who should work even on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ anians do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , did nothing with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila or the fact that the concert has been canc@@ eled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom , there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are being put to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian News Service adopted several former government officials and members of the teaching association , with the reas@@ oning , which comments on comments in social media cri@@ tically related to problems linked to the deep in the country .
given the show of H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s opinion only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to influence a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ anians .
for him there is progress and take progress . Jordan has managed M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila again for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - so it looks H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , bed@@ time and internal changes . he is sure that these changes will be held every day at the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , such as millions of other Arabs also , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he does not just dream of bringing his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them to experience &quot; them . &quot;
perhaps the region is characterized by music , art and literature with real and fundamental op@@ enness - not by bombs , stre@@ et@@ uni@@ tions , and artificial kind of democra@@ cies . at least , he hopes .
until now , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue , and thus also resist resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these great , extravag@@ ant warrior d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is believed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival that is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . a further theory states that the fes@@ tivities , the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years came across and from one time desc@@ ended to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , to force the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab a couple of great seats , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a shared centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ t@@ l ) .
I have been looking forward to the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two bu@@ ggy are just visible .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only True - and a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of an 18 @-@ meter high festival was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , external appar@@ ition and body care were as important as in this history , because it helps to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hair of hair .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us main harbour , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima &apos;s capital Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where road crash@@ es and illegal drugs are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe .
during the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - rising demand for men &apos;s aesthetic services .
the trend , the appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles by famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , led to the experienced hands of hairdres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elabor@@ ate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the utmost limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hairdres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there are experts against each other to show those who can create the ex@@ cent@@ rist L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions there is on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to exchange young people against bar@@ ber tools and instead of bad advice to find a training in hairdres@@ ser architecture that enables them to find work .
motivated by this activity and offer possibilities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job , who is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year , and reported on some of her achievements :
in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the community and the district , which we are very proud , because of love to the children we built this educational community .
Colombia : love of love to guer@@ ri@@ llas
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following articles is the worked version of the &quot; Liebes@@ bot@@ anic &quot; of guer@@ ri@@ llas , &quot; which has published an international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here in a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important , people who are extinct , aff@@ ection to this aff@@ ection ?
this is exactly the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , and inspired her to write his campaign &quot; cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconc@@ ile ) to write the young people .
only recently it was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace agreement with the guer@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was considered the signing of peace agreement as so significant that the Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
before Colombia is still a long way until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
Guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ ak@@ ras , who lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to a rh@@ et@@ oric of war and , around the clock , they have to integrate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , strug@@ gled to life in constant fear and in some cases , deep@@ ened hatred toward guer@@ ri@@ llas , these have to support them in their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that young colum@@ nist could join together and would have to help the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ llas , to welcome them back into society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ ri@@ llas - who will then be handed over .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation was made at the World Summit of Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there were Leonardo and Cris@@ tian the opportunity to talk to Kail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this declared that we love the people we love to write on the day &apos;s Day of love letters , but those who forget them need much need .
he plane , he continued to share his love with people this year , which needed in the most urgent need .
so the plan was created to write letter full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , which will now find their place in society and create a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Mani@@ z@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ I never thought that someone would be forgiven &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ i@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ art traveled to the camp to make the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC felt so on how they had done before in order to meet the orders of their leader .
but this time they had no orders , but letters full of sub@@ sid@@ y from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all those involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings come through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is in between , &quot; said the President Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after we had handed over the letters , a former fighter carried me through the camp of guer@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of cottage in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla struggles ) saw , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ llas who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because besides him on the bed a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ egran@@ ate , a le@@ thal weapon in the thorn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reply to a letter which somebody has written . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life , somebody has written something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I reply to that . &quot; suddenly I ran our tears on the che@@ eks .
I embra@@ ced him completely , and set me beside the pom@@ egran@@ ate .
perhaps he was sorry for war , it was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighting , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected something different from life than war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would be forgiven for my mistake .
but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have learned how I need to deal with weapons .
but now where peace rules , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
for the kick @-@ off students and some leader of the F@@ ARC joined a discussion round .
the students were all raised as early as war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC proclaimed the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insights into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years , we witnessed the opportunity to develop a political party , we can also contribute to the society in this country .
for a goal of this figure , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people who have never found hearing , and had no electoral law , and that people who I often had seen as a monster , and even hate those who were turned around by their lives and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , will hurt me .
but it comforts me , that all men - including those who have caused , and caused much harm to us , and give us a smile and hug .
many former fighters responded to the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the camp of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example , Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the City of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the column was made , according to the dis@@ armament of peace .
but that is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to attack and prot@@ esting the weapons and that &apos;s totally justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we from the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifice , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . among us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be coming .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

homosex@@ ual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
in the past months , activists have witnessed the reporting of the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , that depends on the LGB@@ T@@ Q Church , did not appear just over night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a tran@@ ss@@ ex@@ ual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the LGB@@ T@@ Q system in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international headlines in several months ago , after reports were published , which were the deteri@@ oration , torture and killing of que@@ erer men in the Republic of them@@ ati@@ se .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; it threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who took suspected que@@ ens and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which was why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ ya had experienced the sexual har@@ ness of their land , the hunt was opened to Sabrina .
from fear to life her life attracted it to the United States .
Sabrina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day , I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who checked in difficulties .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , he did a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere in the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen Friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate these dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the round about the whole of What@@ s@@ App .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
when I was doing just a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a men &apos;s voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt a bit in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt me .
then I heard a set , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long do you still want to honour the family , you sne@@ ak ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t recognize the person .
I only know that there was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and woke up last end in the hospital .
apparently some women had heard everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two cores in my right lung wings .
OC Media : in which nurse were you laid - in the men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor stood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for this .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he has changed resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
in the last February , I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some remote relatives .
the desired to send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they stood wei@@ rd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by using the streets ; others wanted me to show up my family in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my gender that everything was only bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have bask@@ ets size C - what would I have to say in television ?
OC Media : how does your family have to deal with this print ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s always hard for them .
some older people spoke my mother on the street once .
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the whole republic .
we can &apos;t touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much , and she took a rope around his neck .
fortunately , the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with a dark@@ ened wind@@ ow@@ ls and a plate shield with a 95 .
after the third time , it was clear to me that something la@@ zy was la@@ zy .
my human rights friends checked out the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how are you fled ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to offer their names , but I will say that I remember all of them . they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought it without registration , without identification , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the garbage .
came and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a fore@@ ig@@ ner .
I checked the SIM card to my mobile phone .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you do not believe , you warm@@ est in safety , just because you have left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you wake up . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about sexual activity , however , this is a table theme .
some traditional Cau@@ c@@ asian elements are still alive in me .
as much as I desire it , I cannot overcome this sec@@ ular barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we ch@@ att@@ ing with camera , I actually give up trouble as the person seeing them from her past - so on my male form .
but that &apos;s very hard .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who have stayed ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for the needed I needed more information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked with somebody who has a one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during the Ram@@ ad@@ an were not arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of the Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait to wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely , they are now concent@@ rating on family and relatives .
so I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person , and at the end demand an evidence that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood gen@@ ug@@ g@@ ation .
OC Media : are males still held in these secret pris@@ ons now ?
Sabrina : a friend of me says that there would not be many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relations or were dropped from their relatives to put Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they will be held there , so they can present them later as terrorists .
say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim they would have attacked any village or military base .
you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically di@@ pped to radic@@ alise itself .
OC Media : is that only a assumption or have you a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote somebody who was imprisoned in Ar@@ gun for a half months .
he says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard had grown .
there was nothing new of them ever since .
they simply took them away .
and so called Lord , this person himself was , when these men were taken away .
until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there were no reports so far . we suggest that such actions are quite possible .
why else could it not allow these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation already in the past ?
Sabrina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think , even before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ y when I lived there - and I never had trouble .
seriously !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia was initially wanted to bring us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ci@@ vil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately cast us back into the stone time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyeb@@ rows were sli@@ pped ; I had coloured eyelashes , wearing tube jeans and short tops .
the safety of the Sch@@ aria has never touched me just a hair .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ y there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people as me met .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and all the city knew it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a language of speech : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
they often say it often , when they are fun over the sick .
OC Media : so they simply shut up their eyes in front of you , because they believed you are sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they have never been off@@ ended , never hun@@ ted and never ro@@ uted .
OC Media : how long kept this mercy time ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about mor@@ ality on television .
he did not talk about us by se , but rather over the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel like people started to change in the city .
he who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at once , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic could steadily be worse .
OC Media : what activity do you move now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US are not much .
apart from that , I still worked as an activist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I agree with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , gath@@ er@@ ings , I join them to the hospital and help them to get dining out cards .
I don &apos;t have a cent for this .
I discovered these people myself , when I ab@@ ap@@ per@@ ched a flu@@ ence .
I am Muslim and would help those who need help .
OC Media : wear a Hid@@ al@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that is al@@ right .
so is nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
that is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya that you want to know with foam in front of the mouth , that there is no gay among them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have those who have the Cab@@ ard@@ iner , those who have the Russians , on the whole planet it is , but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , that &apos;s why it is unpleasant to hear something .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ed Muslims who go to the mosque and during the Ram@@ ad@@ an fa@@ sten - live together with men .
do you know , many think about Transi@@ tional identity to men who love men , and they believe that you &apos;re going to transform his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a gu@@ ile .
these are two different things - two different types of emotion to be accurate , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body .
don &apos;t know if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m here personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am myself myself .
local groups war@@ n against an increase of self @-@ mor@@ den within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
for the past few months there is a strong increase of self @-@ mor@@ nings .
the photograph of the Arab worker in Iran was provided by the patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the in@@ ability of his family to come up , such as Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video filmed on YouTube was the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
some people quickly made it quickly to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ ant hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the internal combustion were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide which happened in August within the Arabian Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists war@@ n the place that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month , some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - heard this month .
their stories have one thing in common : all the family fathers , who felt because of persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and unable to pursue their families and pursue a safe job .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a majority of Iran live in Iran , was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to deny their livel@@ ihood of living .
in a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power and took a great efforts to finish ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most populated and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , regional economy continues to be slow , and the local population receives only little of that wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and discharge .
the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ Ara@@ bians systematically tr@@ usses local jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also built a variety of com@@ bs , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om are diver@@ ted .
these dam@@ s have led only to destroy the devast@@ ation in the region , causing local agriculture , as well as fish and palm trees in the region .
the unemployment rate among Arabian A@@ haw@@ zi &apos;s adolescents now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director of cooperation , work and social welfare , announced that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who completed primary school , completed 55 % of a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; System@@ atic strategy ... which aims to destroy the mind of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights activist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of self @-@ murder under the young Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ men .
Do@@ him@@ i said that especially unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic ethnic Per@@ sians and anti @-@ Arab Dis@@ crimin@@ ation in the setting process :
since officials and institutions do not prefer the Arabic workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi is de@@ ferred access to labour services in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of ruling regime which aims to destroy the mind of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their lives outside of their home Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their ancest@@ or and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to Ah@@ w@@ azi , and so that the Arab names will not be toler@@ ated at the workplace , the speech of the Arabic language or the Arabic language of Arabic .
given the conditions given to Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi , human rights activists beat the alarm before the situation is explosive .
it remains to wait , if the world is w@@ aking up and knowing thereof .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why not I identified myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion that was written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website . this article was an object of several discussions where many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
if I say that I am not a feminist , many women , especially white women , who represent themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
you are wonder@@ ing why I am not part of the movement .
they even do well @-@ reas@@ oned scientific and social arguments from me why I should be a feminist and why we generally do all femin@@ ists * .
for example , women still earn less money in spite of the same education as men .
that women still stand under strict observation , when it comes to what they are allowed to do with her body .
violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women are sooner or later in various areas of life to a gl@@ ar blanket , and that discrimination based on gender are still across the many different countries and beliefs .
all this is aware and known .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old .
I am a black woman .
and yet : if I have to talk on skin color , rac@@ ism , black women in black women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women , on what kind of we have been mis@@ used , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white femin@@ ists were silent to mention many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; sing their voices and &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya , &apos; to sing &apos; their vote &apos; to reach Gender equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , a institutional form of rac@@ ist motivated violence , which we are exposed to black women on two times .
or above that black women and women of other ethnic and country of origin earn less than white men and women .
the fact that black girls and girls with mig@@ rant backgrounds are more often condemned to school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spher@@ es and women with mig@@ rant backgrounds are exposed to higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women .
on the other hand , I want all women , all men and all humans are not connected to the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join a movement as a black woman , who ref@@ uses to consider un@@ just in@@ jus@@ tic@@ es in their thinking that relate to the gender as well as to the skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and I will not have to fight my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist sphere that always has rejected me and countless others black women and always rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compl@@ ained in 1851 in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I refuse to maintain a ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a human and mar@@ g@@ inal beings &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to connect my group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs , in order to drive your eg@@ o@@ zent@@ ris@@ ky program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will not try to lay white women the importance of the gro@@ unding of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to revi@@ ve them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to limit women of different information and limits itself from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to release myself full and full of femin@@ ism and decided to insert the movement of the Wom@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of a white @-@ feminist para@@ dig@@ m that is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women in our own ideas and give us into the spher@@ es that will be created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book of African wom@@ an@@ ism : Rec@@ ord@@ ing O@@ ur@@ selves ( e.g. : Africa @-@ Wom@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves , in which they are perfectly safe in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed to the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are immediately sum@@ ming up , separ@@ ating these lines , please let me know about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contra@@ dictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this para@@ dig@@ m I existed .
I will be recognized as part of this para@@ dig@@ m due to my dark skin and due to my existence as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment that doesn &apos;t exceed my life nor ignored , nor rejected .
Pad@@ del@@ ici@@ ously against pollution : the man &apos;s mission , the rivers in Iraq for future generations to protect

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and worked version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; of tur@@ ally . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # ref@@ uted ) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected people .
a police officer said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that she had nothing to do against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her former partner who had become violent .
since the end of their relationship was past and the police said that their testimony would be laid to the acts , but more could not be done .
when another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena was charged with mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the acute display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez did not use anything .
a few days later , the second wife moved their display .
breaking up the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women have shown at all , they will generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women also are financi@@ ally dependent on the men that they abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who have to admit victims of violence against the law en@@ forcement authorities .
accounting and Statisti@@ c 2 In@@ visible mi@@ tig@@ ation and a legal system , which is nothing less di@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 levels of laws : good base , def@@ icient implementation b@@ lows and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really mis@@ used , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Document@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the Office of At@@ tor@@ ney General Assembly imposed 9@@ 600 ads because of domestic violence . at 70 % of them it went to violence against women .
86 % of ads came by police .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence among the peace parties . 86 % of the ads came from women .
in the ads , 40 % of women said they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse .
this statistics , however , do not show the true mag@@ nit@@ ude of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di actually displayed only few of these offen@@ ders . &quot; on every woman , who will be ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who is ref@@ unded because of physical abuse are two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained to the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the murder of women in Paraguay was not an independent attor@@ ney , prosec@@ utions authorities cannot be documented every year from their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the Co@@ ordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman dies due to violence committed by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that takes nothing
before Mariana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the fixed friend of Carlos Vera , insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends .
in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but after that , it should repent .
today , Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos , but for two years she endu@@ red the psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and simultaneously the most severe recognis@@ able :
I never thought that I would become a victim of failure .
when I read about it before , I always thought that only women are going to be sub@@ mis@@ sive , because they are fool@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mariana is used to report social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated it .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos myself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ isch , whether he ever raised the hand against her , and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked to Mariana why she had fallen so long of Carlos and left him not earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have some complic@@ ity in mind .
Victoria Santos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner did abuse them .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te CRE@@ O network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse .
in the group , they can speak with others about their experiences , listening to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case , everything began with psychological mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
her weal@@ thy partner even managed to convince her to convince her that it was worth@@ less .
then he started to beat them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as advertis@@ ements in the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , she did not receive assistance .
it led a trial against its former partner who developed into an un@@ search@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country , in which it mainly concerned money , power and the influence of their former partner .
ways : a good approach , def@@ icient implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws which are very good , but not used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ad@@ vert of Mis@@ uses is a way full of resist@@ ors and a struggle against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , sees great problems with the use of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ E@@ lla ( # interc@@ ept ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ e@@ Wen@@ ier ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
in the original design of the law , fem@@ izi@@ d sees to explain and har@@ dening har@@ dening as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legisl@@ ature has changed in some points to win the MPs to the law , that feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , currently banned in Paraguay , will be banned in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had intended to take the majority of the ( bureaucra@@ tic and economic ) travel costs that have to carry out the victims of violence themselves if they simply want to refund , and wish to receive a safe accommodation in the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri , argu@@ ing that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not have sufficient financial resources available :
Paraguay is seen as part of human relationships as part of human relationships .
here , a change must take place , so violence will not be viewed as a bit noisy .
those who remain silent in the facts of this facts , and contributes to the off@@ ender of the perpet@@ rators .
we have to refund so long ad , until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer valid .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been changed , however , a passage that the partners were called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section regarding reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for ag@@ gres@@ sor to attack his victims .
the submission of the words &quot; sex , &quot; &quot; political violence , &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a big set@@ back .
this article is the shortened and worked version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; of tur@@ ally . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # ref@@ uted ) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .

independent media in Oman a year after prohibition of a newspaper continues to ban attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a decision of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the om@@ an authorities have closed the independent Arabic newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sult@@ ans .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he served a year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and confirmed on trial later .
Oman has been gover@@ ned by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Said , who came to power after he had his father , Sa@@ Ã¯@@ i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , by a coup .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Lieutenant Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the sult@@ ans of the Sult@@ ans is characterised by the adher@@ ent efforts of security forces , the public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including freedom of freedom , including press freedom , viol@@ inist and human rights def@@ ending , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists .
the authorities restri@@ ct peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and foreign citizens , including activists , remember their views on public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , as well as offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and detention three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on corruption in Oman since its founding in 2007 over corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , announced an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking Parties &quot; hands of justice . &quot; in this way it went to corruption in the pyramid and the mixing of high @-@ ranking officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a verdict in an inheritance .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , member of the committee on the ISS , was charged by the special department and was arrested by his arrival of security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS Vice @-@ chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j announced that he had appointed chief editor for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the newspaper was closed on un@@ specified time after the information Minister had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on every way , including online , from August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial in M@@ ask@@ at took place the first negoti@@ ation against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri .
the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j both were condemned to dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; sub@@ gra@@ ding of the press of the state &quot; .
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violations of an audience ban and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of prison sentences and fin@@ es of each 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a year@@ ling prohibition against the two journalists was rejected .
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to a year of jail and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 U.S. dollars ) , after having used the use of an information gri@@ ds to the dis@@ sem@@ ination of material that could pose a danger to the public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , a deposit was fixed to 5,000 om@@ an Ri@@ al ( 13@@ 000 US dollars ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ al Court acquitted Al @-@ Ab@@ ri on 26 December 2016 , condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j , however , to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari sentenced to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after a prison sentence of his six @-@ month prison sentence in M@@ ask@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his sentence in jail .
the Appe@@ als Court also lifted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper sees themselves exposed to attacks by the om@@ anic government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information received an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further instruction in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , making the Minister for another time against the decision of the Appe@@ al Court to restore the publication of the newspaper .
the constant closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press freedom was injured in Oman at most recent times .
other injuries include , for example , the closure of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and exercising pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to set up their operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ an authorities are still not willing to prepare an end to an extensive violation of the press freedom .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ an authorities to :
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j would release promp@@ tly and un@@ condition@@ ally independent ;
2 . make a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists can pursue their work .
3 . protecting the press freedom in the country and
4 . under all circumstances , human rights def@@ ending and journalists in Oman have hin@@ dered their right human rights work , and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial ver@@ ic@@ ans , ex@@ ert .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ state organisation , the rights of human rights ( including independent journalists , blog@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries , with funding of Mein@@ education and freedom of freedom to assemble and provides protection to them .

Africa &apos;s medical research : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his permission
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need of medi@@ cally medi@@ cally medi@@ cally medical research : for one of them missing in the offer of global healthcare , many medicines and vaccines which cover the special medical needs on the African continent .
diseases like AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria have a major problem in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investments in the research of these diseases caused by the pharmaceutical companies .

Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Centre for research regarding infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic for first gra@@ ti@@ fying impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched himself at the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and on mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ arian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I also launch a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB , and other relevant path@@ ogens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about major scientific topics in your country and in general Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only employ solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always stay recipi@@ ents , instead of being M@@ acher .
the solutions we get , often are not good in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
g@@ v : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from USA and Europe .
projects are well @-@ funded differently .
it is difficult to find people who come back or want to move forward , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
g@@ v : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there are need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of the world , healthcare ( non @-@ transferable and infectious diseases ) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa from Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often , there are limited speed , things to do , and the value access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here .
the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds will change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been bred in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as out@@ red@@ der , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was made only by its own inf@@ ancy and the question of how many types of salads can get boundaries .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he realized that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to bre@@ ach them .
the patents are not only available for individual types , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or co@@ iled leaves .
over the past years , more such patents have been registered on ever more plants like grain or cart@@ ons . based on this trends , plant bre@@ e@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia tradition , Mort@@ on still takes a salad , but meanwhile he needs longer , because his work is still more difficult due to more limitations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like a rock bro@@ cken in a river in order to pump out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do this now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go well to salads .
and if they with@@ stand before the court , no one can breed a new salad variety because all the features are already patented . &quot; he makes as good as possible and tries to breed those features that he wants .
however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
he also joined a movement , which is getting bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; bre@@ eder ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the international space station ISS have bred red Roman sal@@ at of the variety out@@ red@@ dish in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and eaten . there will be tested if plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like it would come from the IT @-@ area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was set up in order to ensure that some plant species and land@@ marks are not protected as intellectual property and are thus used for plant@@ ations .
under the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ eder can under@@ take that others may be able to use far@@ med seeds free of them .
this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eder allow only others to breed it to breed it , and not immediately explo@@ it - two aspects that are banned by many plant pat@@ ties or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ties .
dozens of bre@@ eder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
ble@@ ak prospects
for the em@@ eri@@ als professor of University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i , board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds plays to him a role in larger cl@@ ashes such as biodiversity , rights of peasants , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eder would try to kill the latter not or only little , raising seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; Open Source &quot; movement is not employed with genetically modified crops .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; to achieve our goal of environmental sustainability , the recent examples of consolidation of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Monsanto and Bayer , as well as it is offered to farmers markets , should also know how this vegetables is bred , threatened .
food sovereign without seeds is not possible . &quot;
the members of the open source Se@@ ed initiative under@@ take a commitment to others their seed remains free to provide . so , as opposed to it , seed and plant features are patented .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i @-@ supporters argued that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gen@@ zep@@ ool is due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights to plant material , which is therefore always available , un@@ ce@@ forth .
Claire Lu@@ by , the director of the O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability . she found out that about one @-@ third of all competition features as intellectual property is protected , making it either not even usable for plant breeding .
for other plants , there are still no estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by suggests that massac@@ red plants such as wheat in even larger style are patented as salad or carrots .
a Question of Vis@@ i@@ als
plants are bred so they have targeted features - of such as their taste or their colour improves up to such , because of which they prosp@@ er in certain environments , and threats as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for bre@@ eder is increasing by ever more patents . genetic variety is currently necessary than ever before , since the changed conditions are worse than ever worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Monsanto &apos;s spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognise that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for monthly activities . with a total of four gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural company of the United States set the company for maintaining the genetic variety .
it contra@@ dic@@ ts , however , that the intellectual property could promote other bre@@ e@@ ders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant @-@ related innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken as a plan that everyone can follow soon as soon as the patent is expired .
often , these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
such protection does not support innovation , but support them by public more material and know @-@ how is provided . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees it &apos;s different : 20 years to wait until a patent loop , certainly no innovation .
and if you have to wait for so long to breed in plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the battle .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is , however , that genetic resource has always been a general well @-@ well and it also ought to remain : &quot; independent plant breeding have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incen@@ tives are not attractive for us .
we want farmers make their work easier .
that is what drives us , and it is impossible to use us if we don &apos;t continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on interfer@@ on with the concept to patented plant features : &quot; we are not creating the characteristics itself .
the plants form it itself and as bre@@ eder , we finally have no idea how plants do this .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; if anyone breeds a variety , its own values also in them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation you need to be needed by her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , bre@@ wing in its varieties of agriculture in agriculture .
my concept is exact . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but less than Monsanto are ) patents , there are most smaller seeds , even without any patents , either they reject the patented or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
Frank Mort@@ on &apos;s independent plant bre@@ eder is looking for salads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the opinion that bre@@ e@@ ders would be characterized by avoiding plant pat@@ ties : &quot; it looks like being with my efforts to produce new things , stronger than companies that are patented .
I constantly need new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties into a couple of years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent is protected for 20 years before the competition , where@@ with my opinion makes it very beautiful . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
although the United States appear to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading quickly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the area of resources , works in the centre with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that fulfill certain requirements .
it also supports it to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed to come and sell her own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which ultimately became a form@@ less and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bre@@ eder in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for breeding themselves distinguish themselves from country to land , absent by O@@ ss@@ i obligation not simply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
in early November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission declared that conven@@ tionally far@@ med plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks to the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allowed patents on conventional cultivated plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a statement is not yet no law ; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bringing the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on farmers , operators and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards the basis of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for the &quot; Open Source &quot; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds , explains that the organization is currently a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , for which scheduled next year will be the official starting signal .
a merger from environmental and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , international non @-@ profit @-@ development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group to ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) compiled a database about seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Ess@@ ence - a consortium of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - represent a report that farmers have to maintain , exchange , and improve the seed policy , that ensures a stable care of food products .
in the report , the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems is empha@@ sized - a connection , by Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i , hopes to see him soon more people .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has been thinking about where and how something is grown , and seed systems have barely played a role , &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; we now try to clear the people that there is still more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
still un@@ locking the Egyptian authorities content online .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ nist .
on the weekend of August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt , as well as the Arab world .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised and critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step , and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information blei@@ bt@@ - despite this attack and the violation of the Egyptian right and the Constitution to defend this goal , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirmed that all the technical possibilities will be exhausted to overcome the di@@ stortion and not to admit . we insi@@ sted on to fulfil our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cen@@ sored site of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after blocking the authorities more than two months ago 21 websites , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ speaking edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jazeera network for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

besides AN@@ HR@@ I also consists of the blog of colum@@ nist and Human Rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no access in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog on the spread of Colombia and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now , the blog , whom he addressed to circum@@ vent the interest apparatus of the Egyptian government , even target of an attack .
B@@ logger , the provider with which also Zi@@ adas blog is home , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and took a video how the police prac@@ tise physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly turning around politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment Zi@@ ada said to the lock through the government and reflected what this signi@@ fies for him :
the , blogs to un@@ lock is very old but has priority in the era of del@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi . and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaning@@ less for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It managed to give me the feeling of a siege resistance ; an arrest , an attempted murder , charge of the national Security Council , the blocking blogs and any other site , for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write free in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to the post of articles to avoid c@@ ens@@ orship .
now , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can change the link or create a second blog .
the brave are walking the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities closed their websites from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . these are technical tests on the networks of different Internet service providers ( IS@@ P ) , among others Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and Eti@@ sal@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the di@@ stortion of providers , through the transfer of internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in its research :
on Monday , June 12th we saw how the blocking of websites , V@@ P@@ N@@ s , began .
such practices indicates the purpose of the government to block content and filter content , to access the Egyptian user .
the situation is provided in addition to the fact that the decision decisions are taken behind closed doors , which the Egyptian population has no legal basis , through which they can proceed against this actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
argue the inhabitants .

day for day report newspapers in Brazil with a glo@@ omy headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to many postcard designs .
some of these headlines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Je@@ anne &apos;s second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ser@@ ve rough pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air Force to Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in an acc@@ ru@@ ed financial situation the violence wave of 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are all@@ un@@ acceptable and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
so , for the detailed reporting on violence in the Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16th August the Editorial &quot; That is not normal , &quot; in which it announced to establish a new column called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in town are now published there .
the motives for their decision declared the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes committed in any major city on the world as murder , smokers , sexual crimes , etc . everything that happens in Rio is published in the heading &quot; War in Rio &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that we do not close our eyes in front of the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , chief editor of the newspaper that this decision was no occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war in a country that does not know the war .
in the same video , a journalist wrote that it is according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro &apos;s 8@@ 43 territories that are controlled by criminal organizations .
in the Editorial the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war exchange rate , when it is dist@@ orted , can also be used to interro@@ gate gr@@ aus@@ al bodies of the police , who only shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and its partner .
does the term &quot; war &quot; more than it profit ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Brasi@@ l , the journalist C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira is argued that violence as &quot; war . &quot; in their opinion , it was a jus@@ tification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to put responsibilities at the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra during the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with inadequate investment in personnel , education , and historical and self @-@ counterfeit neg@@ lect of public service .
reminder : the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s state is greater than its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia , is false : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie according to statistics from 2015 to the north and north east of the country . these are the most recent data available .
no such cities is located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro .
when we look at the murder rate per state , Rio is on No.@@ 16 , &quot; she writes .

among these safety policy measures , the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to conquer a massive police force a fav@@ ela and to take a unit permanently there .
in the beginning , this was actually led to a decrease of non @-@ violent deaths . in some years , the U@@ PP has been able to protect against poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under fire .
on his Facebook page , journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charle@@ aux made from one of his article published in 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the designation &quot; Civil War . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio serves as a result of serious consequences for human beings .
for this calls for the state to use funds and ways that are typical for a war . this includes int@@ ru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral harm &quot; and &quot; dist@@ orted balls . &quot;
war , or ago , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ ela is still suffering in Rio .
a week ago it is now that the police have climbed up the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made headlines : an or@@ eller died due to shots that had fired the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syrians , plant mushrooms
screenshot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly through the Assad regime .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and surrounding country , Homs , D@@ eir ez , and Id@@ li@@ b currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege .
the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition , are based on the basis of UN sanctions and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these areas controlled areas controlled by Damascus under siege under siege , which led to some people related to rural areas or tun@@ nels and control points .
through the lon@@ gl@@ ade block@@ ade , traditional food products such as meat have become un@@ re@@ achable for large parts of the population .
in contrast , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ m@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ near and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i do not belong to the most common , in Syria , and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , its food@@ stuff makes them too an attractive source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the Direc@@ tly of the project , the Nabil Sanad , said in comparison to the French news agency AFP :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years , making this project acquain@@ ted and pressed his relief that it is now more and more &quot; to gain popularity . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ near as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to give 125 families to the plant@@ ing pilgrims , Dr. L@@ eila towards Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 , but will earn donations on Can@@ Do by Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity with 80 % .
because of the fuel short@@ ages , it is used locally manufactured from plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. L@@ eila said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production from the regions , the fung@@ al seeds , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a bowl . when this was achieved , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the start of the project and after 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta .
Dr. L@@ eila explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people of the fung@@ al for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
distribution of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , eating food ( such as paper , tea , coffee rate , cardboard , etc ) will be used to profit new food .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities , who are bound to their home .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world , so our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege will be visible .
we want our experience of people in crisis areas , and we can help humanity . &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people were prot@@ ested in many neighbour@@ hoods in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for victims of fires that gr@@ ated in the north of Portugal .
two @-@ two people died and about 70 injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the government out of solidarity with the victims of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions that spread across the northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande it occurred a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forestry surveillance system that monitors land surfaces by satellite photos , in Portugal alone around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of Lisbon &apos;s Lisbon district .
so you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 districts .
Portugal is burnt in the true sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017
some of Twitter users divided up pictures :

numerous videos are spreading in the web and show images that allow better insights into the events :
the des@@ ti@@ able tragedy
the objective of protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures .
people asked why the civil protection was not able to prevent the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
JoÃ£o So@@ ver@@ al from the Con@@ federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for anything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not find it anywhere : there are dozens of stories of open roads which were enclosed by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen in June , since the streets were very late . &quot;
in addition , construction permits will be consul@@ ted with a high risk of fire .
a broad proposal on the forest @-@ form , which had brought the government following serious bre@@ aches in the years 2003 and 2005 , was promp@@ ted by commun@@ es that the new rules saw an obstac@@ le to investment .
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the applicant of the case to self @-@ protection - that was an open back door , so that everything could be built , &quot; JoÃ£o Sor@@ val leads to the same article in the paper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the environmental organization Quer@@ cus made sure that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees made of slightly inflamm@@ able wood , as in a v@@ icious circle , is always spreading on the fires of this kind .
these problems come to the problem that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , were searching for information or attempted to contact members .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time over the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched by the developers JoÃ£o P@@ ina in 2015 to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ades and was so decisive in this fat@@ eful weekend in October so that the servers of the 400,000 users who pursued the fires stopped , there were more than half a million requests .
even the founder asked for help :

the way from refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepren@@ eur

in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group , which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . in this way , Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair .
just at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother doesn &apos;t say it then , she knew she would not see her son a very long time - maybe even more .
in the morning dawn , the boy was to break up .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the Schle@@ p@@ res .

CC @-@ 2.0
Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Haz@@ ara @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt shelter suddenly .
the Taliban were getting closer to the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in direction of Pakistan or Iran .
after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan again .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ h@@ ort . work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and tow@@ ed bags with mort@@ ar , who were heavier than himself to make his living .
at that time , as today , the lives of Afghan refugees in Iran was influenced by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af re@@ minded in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , which we worked well .
there was no services there and no heating . we hang@@ ed n@@ ylon in front of open windows , so that we cannot freeze in the night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without Pap@@ ers in Iran and made herself ready for the journey to Europe .
in the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af returned to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af homeless , walking alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church that divided twice on the day food .
it is true that Italy is due to relatively high awareness quot@@ as a kind of second chance for tim@@ ely asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions , the asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special events &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; this is an impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can then be allocated for asylum in a recording centre , if it &apos;s official request for asylum - which may take up for months after the registration of asylum seek@@ ers .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so also A@@ ha@@ af departed .
but his un@@ t@@ ear@@ thly life of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to free himself from these conditions .
after spending several years working in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af raised his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel , and opened a fast climate .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis Succ@@ ess Story now is the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award 2017 , which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afghanistan are living in Italy .
for many of them the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years some of Afghanistan @-@ driven companies developed , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Oriental Experience , in which the Kell@@ ner and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims to spread far beyond the Italian food industry and retail trade and aim back to the country that he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forget my country , and I can &apos;t live happily when I know my people suffers .
I plan a project for peasants from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of the company and have to get the same possibilities like everyone else . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af for@@ mi@@ ths also plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can sell packaging and preser@@ ving techniques . &quot; in this way , they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ ets on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but the end is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af did this trip itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this road .

the Egyptian parliament exam@@ ines a bill that sees social media such as Twitter or fac@@ ebook only after registration in a government authority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; users had to be able to use social networks within six months following completion of the authority on the agency &apos;s website under indication of its name as well as its ID number . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who have missed this step could be sentenced to six months in prison or the extension of a criminal charges .
the law , advertis@@ ed by sixty members of par@@ liament@@ arians , lies at the parliamentary report as well as the constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another member of parliament filed a bill , in which har@@ sh@@ er pen@@ alties would be introduced for the ins@@ ult of the President or high officials .
under Egyptian law the evidence of the President as well as government agencies are already fir@@ med . however , under the bill of law , a such act would act with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law should be passed , this can be up to three years &apos; imprisonment for sharing .
in addition , this would provide a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of expression has been in danger since many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud subscription Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , when he was arrested by Egyptian polic@@ emen , demonstr@@ ating violence against prot@@ esters that had led to the military coup that led to the minister of elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested during the same incident , four years in custody for a trial date .
recently , his negoti@@ ation was post@@ pon@@ ed on 20 May because the prison conduc@@ tors were s@@ worn by human rights groups claiming the def@@ endants of the prison in the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , hypo@@ cris@@ y from among other weapons land , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court said in G@@ iza , the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were accused of their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
tun@@ ic activists listen to a le@@ aked documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ g@@ ation of Sami Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly supported by the President of the Republic , which according to the plan was expressly supported by the President of the Republic , according to the plan by dictator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali who accused corruption of accused am@@ nesty .
the document published on 21 April on the Na@@ wa@@ at website , casts out a light on how to look the pre@@ si@@ al plans for the support of the legisl@@ ature .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of its sources , indicating Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press co@@ de@@ xes , which rep@@ lic@@ ts journalists to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the Tunis District Court on 9 May , as a witness in the case .
will China force the users to force social media to present their identification ?
according to new rules on the Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media need a permit in China before they write or share news in social media .
in the provisions , it is also stated that registration is required with the full real name .
analysts assume that by elimination of anonymous comments in discussions within the social networks , it is un@@ clear how the authorities will apply this regulations .
Chinese citizens proposed in the social media , these rules are only sel@@ ectively controlled to protect the civil journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we then see in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state c@@ ens@@ orship of Russia closed access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or failed We@@ Chat to register with the state government as &quot; organizer of the information spread . &quot;
this term is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government performs a list of online services , which allows the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make responsible services to remove contents and force them on request to interv@@ ene user data .
these websites currently include web pages such as V@@ contacted and Od@@ no@@ o@@ fre@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has inter@@ ruption Wikipedi@@ as
a Turkish court had the inter@@ ruption of Wikipedi@@ as in Turkey after Wikipedia administr@@ ators refused to delete two English articles , the data , Turkey support the jihadists in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication had been locked , the site was locked because they were working together to &quot; an source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to attack a political det@@ am@@ ination campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey blocks the website completely . it is , besides , among other things , China , one of the few countries worldwide , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
