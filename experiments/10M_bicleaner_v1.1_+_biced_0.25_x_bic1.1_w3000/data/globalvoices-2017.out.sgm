<seg id="1">Although I visited the US since 2012 at least once a year, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American films, American authors have been dancing and operated with American movies.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a very profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist, mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Gartham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporters, who covered the murderous conspiracy of a oil Magnatas, the Supreme Court of Justice to judge his interest, wanted to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "I was it, as if this is the absolute truth, all others forget it is what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration had only strengthened for the United States.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country where I've ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming you can always be who you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very bad love story about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the tourism and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is to me, as he retreats with his narrow-minded.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks of a former college, and openly explains his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-American and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, which he won with the republican election, was the highest number ever reached by the party's nominal candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this biglot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not put Trump and his voters to the people I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, takes people from all over the world, a deep believing man, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps are also not supported by Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer,"</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">The intolerance of intolerance is also in contrast to generosity which I experienced in Sandy Bahr, who fights for life long, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It fits to the dedication of Kristi Kappes who always with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped us to accustom us to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew leakey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and they embodied by them, they deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While pumping on his way to nomination Republican Presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and counterpart to its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The argument with the idea that people have voted for trump, because they were either shared his racism and fanatism, or because they were ready to oversee these things, almost the heart broke.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to describe the trump-voters as relieve.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify the people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who deal with another way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears are not taken into account of the hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those electors, of whom most know are, for trump, because they want to win the control of a country which she has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to rise up a man who looks different with contempt on those who look different.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "whitelash" "" "(Anm.).: as much as" "" "impact of white against all other ethnicities," "" "Word Game from white in Anmelon to the White and Whiplash, which means so much as Schejdertrauma), as it was the big Van Jones, has exactly killed what America has done so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background is always mag, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country, as his president, elected the son of an Kenianers, whose history, as he himself says, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is on the rod again, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">At all of this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a manifestation for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, captain Humayun Kahn, would have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd responded with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roared the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos play a square in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they called, and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if a man who is not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan chatted with the words: "God be thanks, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, the message said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could find no more place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero church in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaean city Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music that is played at both places, not only the life of the children changed, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the refuse</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the outskirts of a large garbage dump just 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -but worlds apart from the nearby prehistoric ruins and of its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years the La Banda de Música (Musikbanen) now plays in the community: a symphony orchestra, which with its musical instruments, has a possibility to overcome the surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The church, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexicos, is known for its drugs and abuse.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a coincidental encounter with a French pilots who started a musical project and became a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, the local press noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and playing with shining eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village, which is practically on the biggest garbage dump of Asuncion in Turkey's capital - on instruments which are made of recyclable waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with recurring instruments, which consist of local firm waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling works under Favio Chávez started to transform parts of the waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violin, viola, celli, contrabass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion that were all made out of the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as the music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, reminds on the initial time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First, it was very difficult because we had no space for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place where the parents knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was somewhat shown, which he had never seen before: an made of waste produced.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a complete orchestra, which plays with instruments from re-prepared material and is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landmark Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) draws the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of trash every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who are living with him and from him are the poorest - like men in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landing harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational acting from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can fight illegal fishing effectively</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fighting wild fishing fights.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The publication is done within an agreement with Global Voices to joint use of contents.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already run illegal fishing in Liberia before the other coast of Africa visited Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were thus upset up and slightly sloping, a criminal law of this species to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, Comoros, Mozambique and Seychelles mobilised rapidly against the ship. they refused him to share one of their harbours and refused to share it a fishing permits.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that you just refused," "" "Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fishing authorities. it is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was expelled from the waters of the region: it didn't manage to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia, due to pillaging of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protects resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 was founded by the NRO stop illegally fishing (Illegal fishery).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that were expelled from their waters back then.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries, who are inned and work together. they share information and stand for each other, where it is illegal fishing," "" "said Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending illegally fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught, is hidden due to it extremely difficult to resolve. thus, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By deliberate misregard of existing laws, which should be protected by certain habitats and species, illegal fishing ecosystems may harm a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing once were hindered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the snail-empo, with the information between individual countries, these events occur nowadays in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange or exchange licenses for example, breaking news to suspicious activity or details that you notice or experienced during a harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very alert when they move on the open sea, via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This enables the authorities to identify ships that fish in banned areas - such as such that suggests that a ship invites its caught fish on other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such tests can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the way and perhaps, whether they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries who are against illegal fishing can be refused on the basis of such information, then that the ships cannot sell their cargo to their harbours. and that they could not be forced to sell their cargo, as in the case of the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it's all about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is financially worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, Chief Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant dedicated to combat illegal fishing in Africa and also supported FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to win an estimated 20 million USD to lost revenues, which lose the eight members of the HISH trade show every year due to illegal fishermen engaged in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has become one of the most productive tuna fishing items that attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world, including those such illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">These practices include actions such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specifying imagery names, fish-protected species and fish in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "you utilize the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-dispatch control system," "" "says Long." "" "earlier a ship was illegal and a country could then say" "" "you mustn't run my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and this legale mhole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">The closed front works so far.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has been exposed to criminal networks, which had spread licences in Tanzania. there were ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has persecuted and found volatile ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its co-operation with INTERPOL, the international authority on the fight against crime, FISH-i can share information about illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">Some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that should help FISH-i, suspicious ships in more precise locations.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always developed, helps maintain the illegal ships that love to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fisheries data and offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off for example their automated identifier systems, with which they can no longer be accessed by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that connects various sources of information. it should help FISH-i to find criminating ships with larger precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team from African nations actually influence over the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceanus Marine Reserve: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through the position of any traceable ship.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "spammun with the neighbors, to get a better picture of what is doing - that's simply meaning," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and consolidate their resources." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts have to run a similar project with which a global system permits the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only detective, but they also relocusts.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that were fished with license previously without license and barely related with consequences, now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have now accounted for a 33% increase of fisheries, since fishing boats have more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia helped Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing, whose use is forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strongly that we now copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we have become a study project." "" "in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually disappear through illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015, six countries have joined together to the so-called West Africa Task Force." "" "they now combat illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH." "" "it is the aim of leaving even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH could report his first big triumph in Somalia: in October, there was Greko 1, a ship that was on the road without a false flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and were not allowed to use towing nets, which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also prohibited in prohibited waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the Accepting of measures against Greko 1, they put forward a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative work for protecting the oceans actually works in the entire world.

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela had rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum, the Venetians responded to the political and economic crisis of the country in which they were gathered on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (example: the response to Venezuela) can be found in both images of these demonstrations and arguments against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the lowlands of Mérida and Táchira, in the centrally-north in the federal state Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation deteriorates continuously, making it noticeable in everyday life of the Venezolans through an acute shortage of food and medications.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of the current President Nicolás Maduro the chance of a fundamental change, but ultimately, a re-election of a re-election was blocked by official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, tributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government's context in their latest articles:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, which is estimated to be the highest level in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% to the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and extensive lack of nutrition and medicine was considered to be the only way to return the country to regain its institutional structures and close a new government alliance.</seg>

<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old Luis Alberto Quijano was forced to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">Meanwhile, in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera process in Cordoba, Quijano said to his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, were committed to crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not find his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden, the same name as his father can carry up to brutal military operations at the La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years, he retained the confidentiality for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation, I believed that it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child, 15 years old you don't notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I could not realise that my father was a thief, the Folterer and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father, Luis Alberto Quijano, was Gendarerieofficial. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, his father was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in the La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>

<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor, who is charged with kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and the kidnapping of a 10 year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who had seen the extent of atrocities which he had seen as a boy, and who testified before a Federal Tribunal for his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power has a parent over his child and how this child chose salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there, I had friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you were delighted with one of the ERP.</seg>

<seg id="224">He told me, I would become secret.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. because so my father moved me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: University notes, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda amateurs, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times after La Perla with - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first time and last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, television, refrigerators - just everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great clot of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day, I went to the other end of the barrack where the stolen objects were shut down and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed at an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I saw in, and saw a song, being tortured on human beings.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal-feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they secured an end of a cable. the other end of the person was strengthened on the body of the person who was straight there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They grabbed a person with handcuffs to the bed, overthrew him with water and hunt for a load of 220 volts in the genitals.</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench inside was horrible... like a dirty winch.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was placed under house arrest, the same smell came from his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I never forgot this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a man can do so much harm to another man?</seg>
<seg id="248">'I knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were fitted with handcuffs and bore eyelids.</seg>

<seg id="251">In the background I saw a series of mattresses, on which naked people were bound up with the face - all were bound by hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">Near the entrance, people quietly placed on the mattresses.</seg>

<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and was buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this, because my father told me home.</seg>
<seg id="258">Besides La Cuadra, some rooms, which were designated as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero struck a man there and killed.</seg>

<seg id="263">When you look at the map, you see that they took about this route and tortured for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed, and they were assigned to a number as part of the process.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived the acts of torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order came from above, that they should be moved.</seg>

<seg id="268">My father brought all the possible stolen things home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time, I had no idea what the "war yield" - as they called it - was.</seg>

<seg id="273">But if one walks into a house and the fridge, the turntables, clothes, paintings, money... steals, then it is not a war yield but vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I have always wondered how my father, the head of security forces, could join this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was an officer at Gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything therein.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>

<seg id="283">We don't need any others!</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have not a very good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">When I said in the process, I showed a photograph of that, on which I wore a jacket and a wheel pullover from wool. I had my father from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still brought clothing to home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, the defence accused me to have been a prisoner of this crime. I said no problem, they can put me on the burden of what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">Anyway, I was there to tell it.</seg>
<seg id="290">'The disappearance of the body is the last vile act '</seg>

<seg id="295">Well, so you expressed exekuated during the dictatorship. but why leave the bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why to release children?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day, my father had brought a girl with her home, whose mother had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">It was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always asked the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">They could simply have put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but why leave their bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not also have families to whom one could get their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abhous act, which one can do to man.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when the democracy was reintroduced, they sent machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="305">They were distressed and somewhere - no idea where. "you never find something," said my father.</seg>
<seg id="306">But anything remains of course always.</seg>
<seg id="307">'i have seen how you killed people! '</seg>

<seg id="309">I was even at the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The idea, signifying my father, was created during a conversation, when he was placed under house arrest.</seg>

<seg id="348">On a sign the Japanese word (coreifensha), the "older motorists" means, falsely - but perhaps also with malicious backgrounds, and # 8212; as "terrible motorists" translated.</seg>

<seg id="352">The daily Kyoto Shimbun in Kyoto wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that nobody has read the translation.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an insult for older people and in an international city as Kyoto simply unacceptable, "Holmes said.</seg>
<seg id="356">"" "the defective English translation was removed initially." "" "the expression" "" "" "" "(German:" "" "terrible motorists" "" ") was later replaced by the appropriate" "" "Elder drivers" "" "(German:" older drivers ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto Prefecture denied to the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the mistake had already been included in the text that they had received from translators and that the translation was not checked up before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger was reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are sorry that older people felt unsuseless (the translation) in our part," said the police.</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News sat down somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was denounced as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are deeply involved in accidents, but certainly cause to worry.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1.941 were caused by a total of 19.460 accidents by senior citizens. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, the seniors 1.803 caused a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">Their share rose to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has fallen in total, the proportion of seniors caused accidents in the same period have increased.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translators are diverse.</seg>
<seg id="377">For excess, one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source language and active language skills to transfer him to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active behavior of the target language - something that is in the case of native language. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language should not be in the initial language.</seg>
<seg id="379">A French mother tongue should translate for example from English into French - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese firms do not employ workers with English as mother tongue, who could make translations into English. this may cause lack of understanding of the surplus, expense, or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees do not leave translations, but then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, become a translator, no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machelle translations are also widely distributed - often with fun results.</seg>
<seg id="385">Those worries and enigmatic sentences develop through machelle translations, show that this technology can not replace a human translators for a long time. this applies to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulation in Japan, among them also the enigmatic prints that often have T-shirts or pockets, are only used in clist reasons - not to read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable as jewelry still acceptable or at least harmless. but of big companies or from the government who have the means to guarantee higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, Kyoto uses a serious source of translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="391">Home page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Freies surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online transmitter Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later on, other user wrote that the Internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are also not accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online stations have also recorded recordings of the protests in Caracas, organised by opposition groups that opposed the Nicolás Maduros government.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out to take advantage of users, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are locked once again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the site of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>

<seg id="403">It is surprising that this is still cheaper than to buy two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO Deadfiltro confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online transmitter. this also concerns the website where the National Assembly carries their meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier studies of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local internet operators can sometimes use DNA. this is a technique that answer the DNS-server requests of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by DNS, the server responds or refuses the request to call such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elapoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third blocked channel, the transmission was stopped on Thursday, April 6th, when the VPITV cameras Elvis Flores, who had survived the protests in Caracas, was taken into custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was defeated, while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later, he was released and VPITV went on show again.</seg>

<seg id="417">The article is part of a series titled "Vacas que vuelan, escuelas que Caen" ("Flying cows," falling schools ") produced by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household, in which it was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before graduating at the University, she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride on her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one who has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas are called in Paraguay the more than 46.000 young boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The shop is quite simple: a big family with little money transfer their underage son or her underage daughter to another, more abundant family. in exchange, the child eats food, training and one roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned is that the children need to afford countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse are - and all this in the context of a contract you cannot raise.</seg>
<seg id="425">This as Criadazgo, practice is widely used in Paraguay because of its involvement and acceptance by large parts of society and despite many complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing his studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - he gathered witness, recherished and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call the things by name, as the feeling of gratitude, which is vaccinated by Criaditas, will generally be silent in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double illusion," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">Then, on the other hand, the family, who close their daughter in faith that they improve their training, improve their position in society and can "do something from themselves" to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that takes up the girl with him and justifies that it would give someone a chance that would not receive any training, and perhaps could even be hungry.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">If the girl is mistreated, his family will experience many years later.</seg>

<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the ex-affiliated Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an officer at the population.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived in her house in Vaquería, a small village with 3000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="440">By the end of January 2016, Ferreira suggested to Marín until it suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They emphasized that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deep in the paraguayischen society of the Criadazgo company responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They recorded the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came to protest protests and demanded that there were no further Carolina "in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"" "" "" "in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," "" "she complained Tina Alvarenga." ""</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control, under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the spar and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded an investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was Criadita was sentenced to 30 years in prison.</seg>

<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, she had to sign the bankruptcy and lost his father his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to work out all, and began selling sweets on the street or on the market of sweets to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">They went all further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina has been sent as Criadita in the capital of Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of its employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">So she had to share the time so that you still remained time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="462">Every morning, she stood at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays, she purifies the fridge, cleaning the living room, polished the furniture and desinfected flooring.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went home again and had time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner it was done with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But this time was limited, because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but did not get unlimited food. "I was allowed to get more books from the library of the householder than food from the fridge," she remembers.</seg>

<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay, changed by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections recently agreed to "agreed on the regulations concerning the use of the use of" social networks "on the use of the use and utility of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="503">If he is accepted by the Parliament, users must register social media in Egypt at a government agency to use social media, including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law, a job would then be set up to share social media to citizens and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with acceptance of the law, users have to register with their right names and number of personnel numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do this, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs, and in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt independent, defines social media as "jedwede application, which is running and used by others to communicate with other voice, video content and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced, because the draft is no indication of how Egyptian authorities should make the registration of the registration. it is unclear that the Egyptian government does not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation at level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentarded and promoter of the Law, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a user name and password "by the Firewall to get the Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on national level around Facebook. due to those would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians, information on their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known to date that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts in front of the site are skeptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technical Research (in German "Introductive Research Technology") of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian initiative for personal rights"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt strongly of the technical capacity and understanding neither the authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine how to control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take it seriously, then it means that they contribute to a strong surveillance system to request citizens or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to carry it to a trial process.</seg>
<seg id="517">That is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the draft must initially be discussed at the legislature of the Parliament and the Constitutional Committees, before it comes to the plenary debate.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and enforcement has been successful or not, the draft "is in line with a pro-military thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensured that no deviating narration is present on the image of the image," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, the Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a legislative flag against cyber crime committed in which a life imprisonment for those planned to threaten the "public order to threaten" and "protest" to protest. "</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north east of Iraq, the animal shake Hana Ahmed Raza and their team of scientists from the NGO's non-governmental organization work on protect the erred Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of leopards that strike through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). in total there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are based on Wilderei, loss and fragmentation of their habitat and as they find less prey.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza shows up in the video, "the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predatory in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the growth of the ecosystem also depends on that a big pirate is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild game is low and goes towards zero. as the team has therefore noted that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza passionate likes to have a different side of their country, which consists of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">It has been involved in field studies for wild animals and an educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the pro-government daily Kahoku Shimpo, the progress carried out in the past six years, were affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011, a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was one of the prefectures in Japan's North East that both had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighborhoods of Fukushima and Iwate were forced, because the tsunami had seized whole coastal cities by the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">On this occasion, Fukushima Prefecture experienced a nuclear accident, so that they had to leave their homes for 160 000 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local point of view, which progress made six years later, to establish the life of the local government.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts (air-conditioning, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">In the three prefectures, Miyagi was able to list 80 percent of the planned spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima is the final light at 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Still, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behelfswald (martial, casetsu juutaku) is still trying to resettle in final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">Almost 80 000 people were forced to live in disciplines after the triple catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 per cent of the evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergencies, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuation, who died after the disaster in heating plants, were resettled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The stand of work and everyday life in the three prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by misfortune, opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now back in operation, in Fukushima only 30 percent of the fishing harbours its operation resumed.</seg>
<seg id="563">In the three prefectures of agricultural land, the tsunami and nuclear accident took place in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, but only 66 per cent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agriculture in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic accident, because only 690 hectares of 5400 hectares of arable arable land of Fukushima, are located in the nuclear power zone.</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely again, but also Fukushima remains undefeated.</seg>
<seg id="567">Tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are back up to 90 per cent at the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, however, can offer only 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is harder to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">To determine a total picture, the newspaper introduced numerous surveys under the native population and the evacuated by. she asked them about the state of re-building and, as you can find out about the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of this article, the Kahoku Shimpo Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami awareness among the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local population has taken measures to be prepared to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents think that there was still not enough disasters with disasters.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who evacuated from the Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In their edition of the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened its attention as well as the position of evacuated Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima had also been a witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident, in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were laid out in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, slightly more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled in permanent spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their country prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">Most of the evacuation areas are most of the evacuation areas that are still in Behelfssonhausen, older than 50 years old. it is more than 50 years old because the efforts for reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima, are competing with massive construction projects. it is a construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that are to be held in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people find people from other countries that speak a different language, differences even seem to be larger than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one recognizes that more links than it appears at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they demand our prejudices to expand our perspectives, and remember that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this sequence of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look closely to these global connections. in our Into the Deep podcast, we treat subjects who often get less attention than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krivoy talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman says about the time where she worked with people from all over the world; Adriana Macias talks about the time where she worked with people from around the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back to his experiences he gathered in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Goiás has suffered a skull-trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on this Saturday and now put him into an artificial comma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered a critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local sculptor Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures also the face of the police officers, who attacked with a striking attack. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">Following the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás announces that Sampaio had been suspended until the end of the incident of the incident from active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers like he strikes in Goiânia and his impact on the face of the Mateus Ferreira (Photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer ruled by a protesters and land on the intensive care unit, his face would be seen for six months in television and the entire oppression would be justified with that.</seg>
<seg id="604">"" "the Facebook page" "" "Desulalizador" "", "a press channel of media activists from Goiânia, shared video on the net, where you see how Mateus is attacked by the police officers and several paramedits shortly afterwards." ""</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, filmed from another perspective, is also immersed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the shown clip one sees the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the Mateus family, living in another Federal state, Internet users have donated more than 10,000 Brazilian Reais (approximately 2.700 Euro) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Goiânia, while he is in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for further violence against activist in Goiás</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás experiences a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was assassinated. here, the military police had joined a WhatsApp group, and now we have attacked the very sad case by Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who was attacked on the intensive care unit, after being attacked by a policeman, who struck him into the face with a whip.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police access</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police sales on Friday last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen were protests at the protests in Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had a stage for speakers, rubber bullets and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">S & D Euro MP Flavio Serafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to abandon violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This also includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again the Brazilian media road protesting, the focus on another, unexpected protagonists lacked: a window windshield.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and estado de S. Paulo are targeted specifically to design a broken glass window to illustrate with a photo of its cover pages.</seg>
<seg id="621">By contrast, the O Globo preferred the title story with a brand-standing coach.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason, more about a broken windshield than the protests of thousands who serve the defense of a special cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must be recognizable if you are striked against any form of atomic damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "Vandalism" receives a absurd, nonsense significance and the typical violence of the military police are caused by headlines with the title "demonstrators on confrontation with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">The Abriculation of forgotten villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane mills contributed to the whole of Cuba's doors (photo: Julio Batista).</seg>
<seg id="627">The community community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known that there is no notable sugarbeet on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago, when the activities were laid down in the sugar cane mills.</seg>
<seg id="629">After replacing the sugar cane industry in the region, and the factory lost after and after its facilities until just the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to be reinvent.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other autographed and commutes to the factories, which are still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldatenvelopan, which is open every day at 4: 00 AM, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not smoke his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are in operation in the east of the sugar cane factories, which are still in operation after a long time, because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something that he was not expecting.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers exactly that in Mañalich would get the sugar cane factory but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already withstands the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the Ineffefficiency, the bad administrative decisions, and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">Production of 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for a few decades ago, but the bad earthed are no more news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane collapsed?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the church saw already better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugarcane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugarcane mills were technically deprecated, and barely competitive, they were immeasurable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories, annual production targets amounted to 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories, which can produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0,03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugarcane plantations and the sugar crisis in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">However, the sugar price increased again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 Report, "Agricultural perspectives" of the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and food organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate approximately $85 million for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's Day will go into history," these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From there, the process of restructure in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugar cane mills, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as a soldier, is known about the closure of the factory, the word that he repeats most, "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all of those surveyed are: not one of them informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">So the place is preserved, they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Prior to the first year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially registered documents that would only be removed from parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulac Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve every dismissal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, responsibility and letters were becoming more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the set-down factory for two years, and he was one who had received the letters. "the country had no money in operation for which was still in operation.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for the retirement in another complex, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He participated against his will at the decommissioning of the factory, in whose construction he helped, participate.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and its main workplace was extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives for the workplaces and services produced in the communities in which they were located, were created.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know whether during the Mammut-speech of October 21, 2002, the then President in the eyes of present persons saw that he guaranteed for the opponents whose factories were no longer in operation for five years.</seg>
<seg id="671">The price of the population for closing the sugar cane mills</seg>
<seg id="672">Since 2004, sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding.</seg>
<seg id="673">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="674">After two years the community of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich learned to change many things, but not always for the better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane mill was closed, or even better, when they began to stop them, they also stopped to asphalted the road to asphalted, this disadvantaged other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with already advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to seek other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They have to spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without a future perspective, many young people left the region too.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youths of the First Nations communities in Canada deal with topics that are important for them. they do with hip-hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">Since 2014, as part of the N'we Jinan tour, mobile audio studios have been working directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked with the Cree hip-hop-group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop increases that the young participators in our conversations as "cultural identity, language, argument, love, self-acceptable" or whatever they will find in the sense.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where the young people are the leading actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia, and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the pedigreum First Nation in British Columbia tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," in which nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not clarified.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video player to convey how important to maintain traditional customs and customs, despite the influences by the globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people do not always rule the languages of the First Nations languages.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whaplean stui Cree First Nation was recorded, the refrain will be sung at Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people received a little help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group that talked to them in the dialect of Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">At the Facebooksite of N'we Jinan, the Stanzhe is available in the inscription, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel, as nobody ever would be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on earth for my days</seg>
<seg id="707">That's the day you will take our terri</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I think we will rise to one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and lead to our youth.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers that stands exactly on the menu, will be close to the entrance to shokuhin sanpuru (cleaning, "plasma models of dishes") of each dish, which is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers look at these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to manufacturing this plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the tokioter district Kappabashi there is a variety of these small companies that produce the plastic dishes, which the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so usual, they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend is transforming today in showy mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the Blogger itinii series published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in the special sale: new with plastic shredded cell tapes as they are shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were transformed into kitschy collecting objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in the essences is increasingly cumulative.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a cave-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also have this part of the Tokyo train station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is a Apple, which covers your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile-cell support and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or nitrollover is used, a popular bag, served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say:" "" "Wow, cool, right now I can cheated my mobile phone with laughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appetizing form, to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone support has the shape of melodic ice cream.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and molybdenum from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">For more skrile plastic dishes, you can watch under: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter The hashtag # 3 and bubble.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you like to learn more about the origin of this trend, then you will give you an insight into the district Kappabashi, which is devoted to exposure to the restaurant industry. as for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="744">The following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports, domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico do not appear regularly in statistics. however, these reflect at all not the extent of the human tragedy that this battle brings together.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on drug bosses as El Chapo Guzmán, chief of the Sinaloa cartel, urged the stories of the conflict completely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the funeral or to the municipalities which have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Standing behind every lyre, behind every bone, in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal animal Político has launched the digital project "Apruna Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with drug trafficking") that give this victims a voice and stories of people who advised the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime cannot only fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if business excludes because they are threatened by drug dealers and the whole municipalities have to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">Pain of the Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "as fear life") tells the stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who is hidden every weekend hidden graves after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father and two sisters, her husband and two of their nephews.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "priests:" "" "like every Sunday we prepare for the task of us again today, which we have asked to go, and to graves, by the people we loved to look for." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="770">At the moment, it has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You are the insurance of my father, but she doesn't get paid out because they demand a death document.</seg>
<seg id="772">"" "where should we get there?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a Vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only show the faces of those who are afraid of fear. we have to show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the State of Guerrero in Central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">Illness and Sensational journalism I already know for some years.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass every day at newspaper kiosks and see the cover pages with pictures, which are actually only from a textbook for criminology or accompanies from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only person who is disgusted or sad. it acts as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) if it is large. and it's also not normal that people listen to songs about the "heroic" from offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is, as if they have lost those who have lost someone, and those who are afraid that they had happened something like that.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, when stories become too naked in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The allegations of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village, that they were "waiting."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to agree that they are spared from such tragedies, if they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four Days Erpressung in the main city district:" as a family has been plundered with threats for money from their business, until it was not only destroyed business by the end, but also their family torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think about everything you lost and remember how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again, when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We just contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are removed from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded its report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will abduct or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days if crying would dissolve my deep root up feelings, but the answers is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn how to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the contribution" "" "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: one of the honored Generation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions such as: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexicos?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless and he tells that he had to teach himself how to make an egg cooks, potatoes, tortillas, and "Chichi" for the babies that live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells about the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom the whole lives of violence exists and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years ago, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody corpse of his father who had been shot by armed men out of a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as a force by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of killings according to the citizens of the National Security Council and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone the Prosecution counted 3103 murders per day. this equates to average 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that organised the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories are still living in the face of becoming a new headlines. this project reminds us of those who don't want to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Apruna Vivir Con El Narco" the data journalism project is called Narcodata in 2015, whose goal is to illustrate the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tortured the country in the past four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment, in which it comes to elevate a rumor or any fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after something has appeared the first time? content in social media, no matter whether true or untrue, tends to pass on.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been used to conduct tragedies that took place in Nigeria or Myanmar in fact.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false copy of image and event - "wrong description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - Do not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in the DRC, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">However, questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank-car roared the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipping around and exploded. 230 people came to life.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country has been neglected for years, thereby devastated. the roads in the region have become a dangerous arrow that had become difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker dropped to the victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">Mastering representatives described a fireball, the dozens of houses, including a movie near, which was full of people that illustrate the football world championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Homes averaged and bleached bodies were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were being burned with the uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "This is Nigeria." from the Imgur users Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2011 5 more pictures of the incident form the atrocious scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of stolen body, which are shaded on the ground while people are watching them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story is not her end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photograph was rectiled several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but it may not be written in the context of the tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram attacked the remote niotic towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">But the numbers could not be confirmed. "nobody stayed behind to count bodies," said a inhabitants to Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Based on satellite images, the follow-up time could be portrayed.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack remained unresolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the Military Nigerias and the attempt to win Boko Haram to win country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DRC occurred again, as it was wrongly presented as proof for the fact and the extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this mischief use of the picture from the DR Congo is only one in a number of malting descriptions; Africa Check has documented violations of Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a proof for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further bring personal comments such as this example falsely the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in relation to supply arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also joined the fatal persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightening, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee, rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from the violence against the Rohingya, Posts like the following ones who brought these descriptions with photos from the DRC:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an acidi-Arab news page, which was falsely claimed in 2012, the president of Myanmars Than Being, monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, it had used the picture from the DR Congo to account this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, posted on 26 April 2017, can be accessed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organisations, the AFP as its source, had also wrongly attributed to being this statement, but did not have the picture taken from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="859">The world wide range of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of this wrong coupling until the years 2011 and 2012 are back and actually come from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using a "reverse picture search" you can see how much information can be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="862">An inverted picture search with the searchengine TinEye has found 344 images below 18.8 billion images, which are similar to 344 images, which are very similar to that of the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixed mask private pages, platforms of social media and communities as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have forwarded false reports, others have tried to unmask the fake.</seg>
<seg id="865">We have been using examples of mischief use and associated with the respective countries, on which side them had been published. by doing so, we want to represent the range clearly than by the language only.</seg>
<seg id="866">Several examples of the listed below are listed in some cases (which were also associated with each other), several examples of misleading use.</seg>

<seg id="910">The article was updated 2014 and at the time of this publication, the image is still included.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article from 2014 on students who were killed by the Boko Haram, published by now deleted, the Catholic near-standing news page Análisis Digital, has expressly stated that the image does not come from the killings, but it claims it was a "similar fighter attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">When the picture ran into circulation with the Boko Haram massacre of 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to contradict that there were connections to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanıyorthyaUyuy" (Nigeria is burning that sleeps).</seg>
<seg id="915">The DR Congo has dipped, provided with this Twitterhashtag, and caused a discussion among Muslims according to the Boko Haram massacre and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities took these events that were suspected in the name of the Islams, a greater attention.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was sweating as proof of the Boko Haram massacre of 2015 (and more than 9.300 times saved). but the messages that were associated with that were no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the goal was to raise attention to the relative numbers of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Vietnamese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message that allegedly was written by a "godfather Juan Carlos Pascal" about the Nigerian massacre was put into circulation, discussions like this here on Vietnamese and declared it to the point of falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the message where the picture of the DR Congo was included, the organisation of the Claretín Missionaries and Pater Juan Carlos Martos.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are further confirmed examples of a defective use of the picture from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">Other accounts, aggregate and sites across the following countries (at the portfolio in grey) also shows the TinEye, but are no longer fully traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data entry with URLs and Time / Datakstempel exist on the Webcrawler and occasionally they have some image files in relation to Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which appeared not only after the original disaster of 2010, the image is eventually perhaps a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and Pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (irradiation) that go through this pods. the first frame is focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in terms of greater discussions about the silence of the assassination of Christians by Muslims or Muslims - the assassination of Muslims - the murdered victims of the Rohingyas.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how African life is undervalued at a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion you want to understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when reading these images cannot give a longer faith.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are zig people who unintended to share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of false and counterfeit information that actual atrocities are untrue and lubricated the actual horror of what is actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of non-violent images has already been debated extensively (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that the rejection of images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern that nonviolent images readers and audience Desensibilites and to take them the ability to empathy empathy (such as this study, who searched carefully, how to help violent media to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there are some to discuss the news media in terms of non-violent representations, the fact that it is essential for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists have experimented with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." you will have to think about situation in which a picture is slightly sugary, which can actually be replaced by context or in totally missive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, every study of false assurances should also be considered as international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons is used according to CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name of Untranslatable (e.g. inexplicable) strives to offer voice enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world who are difficult or not to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are available in every language: they are certain situations, or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unnecessary words are already well known today (such as the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example, Spanish soyesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone resists stubborn every attempt of simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or expression is not enough, why a full explanation, and sometimes somewhat context are necessary to understand what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a long time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and Linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find the example words from Vanuatu, as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Bemch your parents in recognition of how you strive for yourself in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsafe language, which are spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The convenience or laziness that one feels, after the sun has become dared in cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog above:</seg>
<seg id="956">They create other cultures, reveal other thoughts and wake our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, you influence how we analyse the world around us and classify the linguists on this page even more of these "irrecoverable" words, and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility, here and now, despite a speech barrier with someone in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the story of stories in their original language is a possible response.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird, the impossible blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve the language variety of great cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia, or Oakland, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not to be passed to the newborn children.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world's languages can be avoided, if we create cities, accept diversity - safe rooms, in which inhabitants must not forget who they are to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listening often to understand," check these events instead "to listen to feel, to connect."</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storyteller introduce their story first in their own language before and translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion, and their representation that the listeners can be insisted on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They cry out laughter and emotions, as the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional history from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storytale Rassidatou also takes the opportunity to explain typical customs of stories in their country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the beak of the bunny and the Pavian in the language Shona of Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his beak, John Nyamusara is asked, "How is this to speak to an audience that your language doesn't understand?" with a wide grin he shares his sense of ingenuity:</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and the organizers are hoping to expand this. everyone who are inspired by the project can contact with TLS in order to organize their own history records.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico also calls for the US re-enforcement of sovereign debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, focusing on 72 million US dollars, various religious and bourgeois organisations participating in a mass demonstration; the march started at the puerteventual Capitol, the capital building of the capital, and went down to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was called by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (civil front for the neural examination of the debt) and the Ökomenian church of Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocate of the re-enforcement of the debt also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico also calls for the politicians, bankers and government agencies which are responsible for the debt of their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We call for a financial audit and an Steering Committee without personal interests in public debts, with a firm, our working conditions remuneration which acts in favour of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will press and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico refuses to pay a debt that is not their.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be found with sinking retirement payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We require immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not into the country's integrated territory of the United States - suffers from a serious financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Thus, the so-called "Centre for New Economy," a non-governmental non-profit organization without party affiliation with focus on the socioeconomic development, a law relating to state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing public view.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis Puerto Ricos requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">"" "" "" "from the outside, measures will be turned without the participation and conviction of the citizens of danger to be rejected by the people." ""</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration carried the name "Nightry for Light and Truth."</seg>

<seg id="1182">The symmetry-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi is known for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, supporters and members sit down the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions which he has done for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, the annual conference of digital culture that is hosted in Berlin, dedicated a event of the # Freebass campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a researcher in France based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Managing Director at Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints' ready books within three to five days, lases excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inner (The Cost of Freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, published last year and is free here, contains a number of approaches to deal with the free culture in the face of the oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to explain how motions will be built for Free knowing and what the real cost is associated with which this is associated.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors, who are involved in the movements of open knowledge have worked on page to view over the nebula who gives us our newsfeeds and to create something from our different experience.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteers, who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted by the Adra prison in which he was sitting on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have since then no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us begin to think about their own fate, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of temporary fluctuations in this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The Webdeveloper of Open Source and digital activist has been in custody for Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military facility to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi reported that the "Military Police Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military court of his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on November 12, 2015, who used himself as the insider of the Assad government and put them in knowledge of a alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and state remain unknown, however.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in creating access to Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project which founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps there was none of Bassels cultural prototypes, more than the work that he started with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crosswise of numerous civilians and merging Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel was unable to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture that is not only emmed the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This striving into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel was able to unlock this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life in order to dream of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel was brought to me English, even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I've learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he has taught others to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other imprisoned men, as they use computers, at least theoretically, without making them one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a commission that she wrote in 2012 to her husband when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together for a year together in the book.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smugted the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arab into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is licensed free.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Book cover from Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It happens":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens at every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace us,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That any of the dangers are no matter,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, shackles and guardians</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the prisons of prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I went in every detail of your voice and words.</seg>
<seg id="1235">Whom I carry with passion for me,</seg>
<seg id="1236">When your eyes say Lebeam</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I return to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To get all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And about your absence to weep and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I convinced myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of Bassel's arrest, Ghazi wrote:</seg>
<seg id="1243">A year passes away, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">During the first time</seg>
<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you still are in the cage's monster</seg>
<seg id="1247">Bassels story is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the start of the protests in 2011 against the regime's regime for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights), more than 65.000 people have disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence by the regime, tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Until 2016, at least 17.723 Syrians have died in prison since 2011, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">Since 2012, the Global Voices community demands the release of Bassel.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption, he was re-headed for prison release.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambians reacted with anger on a corruption incident, in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state machine, where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is the Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants, with four other defendants, sentenced to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds in the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately requested his re-setting to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the General Attorney General of the Republic, which issued the motion, there was no obstacle reason for Camaraza, again to refer to its old item, as the company was no disciplinary procedure in his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many citizens are not good for action.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned in an interview with the German Wave decision to set the director again:</seg>
<seg id="1262">It is a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step in terms of the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the company should have been a disciplinarian procedure against the contradictation.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company seems, however, and caused no appropriate legal steps to use the relevant functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, rejects this behaviour as well as "conflicting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to one sentence and half of them served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid speeches and motivating speeches, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But as he is incompetent, he has unanimous to reintegrate into the company, which he helped harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resisting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, Young Mosambians and Student of Political Sciences in Brazil, the director consulate no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted it, I can't believe that someone is rewarded with such a way that the state has already been insulted so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the morality and serving the state, * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead of serving itself on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state when handsome it has become an inexhaustible money source and the state itself, this man's tired, the pre-charged and finally was sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was really rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeút prefers to remember the prime minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, remember that a thief belongs to prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the Samora Machel prison, not only for ever being as the first independent president in memory, but also as a sharp, cutting-cutting and - next by said - prophetic orator.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous representations, when he was energetic, confirmed that "an ambitious man would be able to sell his own individual interest, even the fatherland for his ambitions."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactic, but he doesn't turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is criminal "criminal."</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, reactions also were leaning:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment, he sat 10 years and came free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today it sets him the company in which he is losing money back, again under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - Frederick αd. (@ azmal _ Rafik) 12. may 2017</seg>
<seg id="1284">Emildo Sambo from the magazine @ Verdade (to dt.: @ Truth) states that crime is paid in Mozambique:</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored lots of users to wrong</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmical word "Kalar pae" means chick peas or leases.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to data from Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known Social Network received their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjectiv "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook makes the word "Kalar" or an all-out (in burmesischer script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate language in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the ascension of radical nationalist movements has given an extremely low connotation in the word.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight for hate language in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism today, but the word in itself is not automatically evoked by hate language.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that there were also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word, or doubts the use of his use, have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Beyond that, there are several burmesic words with basic meanings that have the same letter sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing' which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splash '),' Kalar Oat '(camel) or' calarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The facebookzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a spiritual manner, whether they would like to use his back pain by making a word play.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase ku la - "Cure" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is the opinion that it will reduce hate language, radically nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook has to be analytic before it kills all posts that will spread racism in suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filates the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you are writing on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead, analyse the post carefully and check it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (splashing belts).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three nationalist nationalists, the hate language, will receive a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action likes to send a powerful signal to all the hate language, the efficiency of this strategy may not hold long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship is often called a catch- and mouse game, where users can simply start social networks to express a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to erase his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar' was banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I got the liken, post and sharing content for 24 hours, because the Post "says the Facebook Community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a wide variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or just try to show their opinions against the Hasselt radically nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed, which has nothing to do with hate language:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Next post-hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are poorly in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook before the initiative were to have done more, for example, the Burmese Internet community said to ask:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Those words to zenith is only bringing even more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they have started without local context or technical support, and have banned words like "chair" or "hereditary curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they had made mistakes, they tried not to rectify the feitful postings.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits offered to them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has donated for much mockery among the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now aware of Facebook and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook postings that contained no hate language, but nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Permission to use.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and watch peas curry and watch an Indian movie.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out if Facebook removes the post which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot is used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">The post says "If you are a doctor, do you cure people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot is used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate language in social networks may include violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the territory of Rakhine where the conflict between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure to bring out the outdated Hasselt on his burmese pages under control, criticised.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of zenith the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to learn more in context than in code concentrated initiatives and learned from them.</seg>
<seg id="1340">In Trinidad & # 038; Tobago is at the end of the daytime</seg>
<seg id="1341">A wedding ring in sand.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Photo by Derek Gavey, CC BY 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The children's toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the Parliament's parliament unanimously agreed a law, which is to offer this practice, so that the heightful age is now 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of marriage and Muslim religious communities in practice, and in May 2016 there came to a large public outcry. at that time, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state could not interfere when that, at age not the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contracting partner of the United Nations Children's Rights, the minors as, to every man under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 indicate that the proportion of children who had already been married at 15 in Trinidad and Tobago were 2.8 percent, and 18 were 8.1 percent." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country was confirmed that by 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitioning and social media movements that endeavours to abolish laws to children's before, followed at the foot and rejoiced by great support. without doubt, they helped me to bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu-guide, for example, had no concerns about saying the critics of the child, they ought to take care of their own matters. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition advocated for tension in this actually uncomplicated matter, and eventually some doubts came to agree whether the opposition would agree to the bill of bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But in early 2017, the bill was decided against the children's before - despite four senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent that could be discussed - so that it could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Only the president of the country must agree and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave us a status update which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted again on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill of draft against children was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and none of them decided.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After he had previously decided in the Senate, the design can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users was thrilled, because the laws have been changed to children's before.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member, Lovell Francis, who used a ministerial Office in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary stuff needed, which has failed the core of the matter, but do you know what? the children's love is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now, and that is nearly worth every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson was in mind, it was definitely long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed to make the day finally arrived:</seg>

<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj has announced his intention to take judicial steps, the law should be adopted, and it seems to redeem his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the General Attorney General Al-wi, a supporter of the law, thought that Maharaj would be justified against the law, the majority of social media users would wish to go differently to the debate on the subject.</seg>

<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we can say instead of discussing the discussion, in a way that can cause only panic and arrogance, so that we, to safeguard the state into our bedroom, that they may be able to safeguard our daughters that they may be abused by large, hard-minded men, who are to be abused, would you then be willing to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But if it comes to a court case against the law, or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children's children are legal or still remains the norm, although there are laws prohibiting them.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was published on January 18, 2012, against the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month the Turkey is now making the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for day is more clear, how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and fans and fans of TV series fight against the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques have used to use internet users (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN reward in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users will not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been subject to Wikipedia for 2008 by Wikipedia, as recently published in an published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University have been adopted since 2007, after Internet Act (Nr. 5651), the Internet Act has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship by Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, several Mirrorpages (pages, which are mirrored the content of Wikipedia and often is updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator machines), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus making a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is repainable despite legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (about the distortion of Wikipedia) we put everything on snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so, the opportunity to read the content on decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the site www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was run independently from the Wikimedia Foundation, and only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to bypass the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansipape.org, a Mirror site of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to hoist similar to Mirrorpages if it is locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla in Panigrahi's open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">It is accessing another URL that is not the original one. that what you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially the server redirects the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos that he looked around, never satisfied. they were blurred with badly placed motifs and full colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivated him to wear a camera and try to graze the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar, Neptune, strives to bring to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home village next to Chitwan National Park, offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that drive attention to Nepals.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook as described this first-class situation in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) had called me. he had a call from my father that would be a Leopard on the shores of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river Dam is just a few minutes from the tourist resort Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him, and showed me the place on the other river, where the leopard was and I immediately started to kneeling pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar is striving for cooperation with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepals Nature and wants to deepen understanding that wild animals are not so frightening as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he arose from face to face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't interfere with the opinion of the sheep in sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleep time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Even I was at home because of the darkness in the way home when the King of the Buecks appeared. he immediately sets up, and he stains away by the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) to his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepals Nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent in order to make in Bardia National Park recordings of Otter. it lasted until 12 days until he was able to photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayon aaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of an content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, avoid women with greatest care, the names of their husbands, or even of older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronouns, or say "Father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women that they should respect the husband due to social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences, they should sustain the norm, this practice is alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was sentenced from the Indian state of Osca by a pseudo-court and repulled by their family and the village community, having addressed a secret relations with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also not to name them by name, is also common among men. however, they have much less to be feared if ever, they shouldn't come to this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health professionals as well as housewives, got a unique club and thus became a major theme in the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, to discuss and discuss the enemy of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is operated by the community Video Volunteers and sets up for the mining of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pahas been working for seven years with the help of their videocamera at the coverage of practices, such as children's homes up to the prohibiting of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and directs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">They reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women, and they played at the same time as ambassador of the wallels.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in their discussion round, acted by women who did not call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">It has opted for this topic, because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to express the name of their husbands, it is a roman to keep it guilty to all obligations and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wish him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't hold this is considered a posterior, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who previously named her husband, had never been named after the name, try out at home, as it is running.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband are silent for a long time, after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me, and said, I should name it from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini left her first discussion lub with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" nor before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, were protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, lovingly and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then asked them all, "If we can't say the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they do, means that they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of her husbands on the lips," "" "says Rohini Pawas out of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the breaking of a centuries-old tradition who married women the name of their husbands" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that, during the whole exercise, it was so shy, and another decided to release the whole frustration against him and his family, to curse him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">In addition, in the adrenaline exchange, to have broken with an ancient Brass, the women decided that they would actually try to name her husbands in their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days, Rohini received a multitude of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in the head: his wife could not stop to tell his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she was stubborn, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said that I should do."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understandable and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini tells how women tried to stop other practices, such as the traverse of the nod-red dot on the forehead, which shows the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would carry the zinappoint, if he would do it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I listened to him to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women did not complete with them, but they think they are now in a better position, even to choose him not to wear it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion group lub is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we do a trip at every discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">We usually pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to worry about women who could hear what could hear, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months, she celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in her life; they danced, sang and talked about things that they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on this problems for so many years and I also have some things, for example, as our identities are knotted on our husbands, never to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things to say loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we have talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have borne only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most is the okay, but some wanted to carry an Salad-Kurta, a wide shirt over a trousers, they don't have weeds.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes-election, morals linked to the Saris and much more, unggelRohini her own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round so that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they have decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will make it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">At the question, whether in the five months have already changed a little bit, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly getting into rolling:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried for a few times, but then we stopped to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it still, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are now wearing Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the discussion lub know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the rotting to more freedom of movement or their own clothing - at the end of a hard to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, you will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">As Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also there.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives us the confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if any woman goes home and other people what we speak about what we're talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the video Volunteers Community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories that will not be reported.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping people for the organ shop, probably for aberrations, worries the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a number of operations into life to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was decapitated and a part of the organs were taken.</seg>

<seg id="1591">Another group, the aim of assassinations for obscure purposes are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN 2016 conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of Southern Africa, particularly in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of prisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo held attention in international community, after his lawyer had announced at the end of June he had been hospitalized for liver cancer in the end of June.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison because of "Subversion" (state threat), having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto which calls for the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the State Department in China described Lius case as" "" "an internal matter" "" "and a spokesman told that he considers it as" "" "it is not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China will continue to call up calls from the international community, Nobel laureates and his wife, timidin Liu Xia, or allow him to allow for a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the Paares in Beijing, others are completely wiped out of the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Index Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">A speaker, however, refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to facilitate the treatment of Liu abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway, when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, even though the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations continued to be resumed in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to restore the salmon factory to China, as the exports have been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news had spread that Liu knew seriously, the Nobel Committee brought his hope for a conditional release and invited Liu to pick her prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his detention he was unable to oppose his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">Liu was represented by an empty chair during the ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was prompted to free Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allowing him to seek medical support, where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, called for China to release the release of Lius as they announced in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we anticipate that China lifts all limitations of Mr. Lius wife as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all visits, which they wish, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States</seg>
<seg id="1652">Us ambassador Terry Branstad told that the Americans said "him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad, if it is possible to help him in his satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokesperson for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the message agency AFP on June 27 that the message to release Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also to free his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The US Embassy's request drew a raging response from China to himself, with the utterance of the State Department, that "no country has the right to enforce and do not answer any other comments on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared with that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as travel agents and access to medical supplies of its choice, which they have chosen according to Chinese Constitution and legal system, as well as international commitments.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision on Congress in order to release the Chinese government to unload Liu and his wife.</seg>
<seg id="1658">I urge China to release the Nobel laureate # LiuXiaobo unconditionally, so that it can't be used in proper medical treatment. http: / / bit.ly / 2tE6kUo</seg>
<seg id="1659">Germany, Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">On July 3, Berlin, the German government loudspeaker Steffen Seibert wrote that Liu "has received all the medical support he needs" and that a "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo" should be the highest priority. "</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on July 7th and 8th at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing the news agency Reuters, that China had great concerns whether the turbulence could be overturned by Liu's visit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, the Canadian ambassador John McCallum China prompted to provide Liu a reasonable medical care and to give him the opportunity to worry about his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told AFP that Lius wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that Liu's not allowed to contact with someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum recalls more:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls on China to undertake its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, to preserve the rights and exercising this rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France, France</seg>
<seg id="1669">French Foreign Ministry required China in a statement on 29 June to release Liu from humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo gets all the treatments that he, regardless of where, needs. furthermore, his wife and his family may have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that France would have no further information on whether France will eventually receive him.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The council of foreign affairs in Taiwan called for China on 27 June to release Liu and demand a greater tolerance towards those who demand peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature Yu Mei-nu from the ruling party party also called for China to allow the ill intellectual Liu to treat himself in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed himself in a statement on June 28 at Liu very worried and gave evidence that many have asked him to pray for Lius Wellbeing.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my faith that the initiatives he took, and for whom he had been punished, led to a harmonious, stable and wealthy China, which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally really moved and encouraged, when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08 signed, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Singapore is a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid, since Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Ministry of Justice, K. Shanmugam should visit Singapore as a town.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the Minister said that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore was to be considered a town.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is, where most people go a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the minister of Justice to" "" "rotate the logic" "" "to defend the existing Authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable land, we say that we finally have no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the note of a flight before the responsibilities, a must-breach.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons led by Shanmugam were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could measure the political system of Singapore not with other 'normal countries', in view of its, he appeared unobjectively undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco, or New York should be compared, alike cities which are run permanently from a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the subject, the good old lyre from the authorized machinations, the proposed democrats, abandoned logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end of the last week, the Shancourgam last week were given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicial system, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He cloaked appropriate questions with non-replies.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng tells Shanmugam to illustrate his mind as they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, so the country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our werder K Shanmugam would take on the effort to clarify this point if it was paid up, in order to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By posted on the blog his comment, he points out about the reviews that it should start to read the entire presentation of the conference, so that one could understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam better in which Singapore was a town and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore was rather a "city" than a country, "he declared that the elections in Singapore were so unequivocal, even if we are looking forward to open and just elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He moved to Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said that Singapore was not a country, "he obviously didn't believe it in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan illustrates his disappointment of Shanmugam, who is a leader of a hereditary generation that makes such polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I'm talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said very much...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Guard which expected me - do I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes it is correct, and what he is aware of what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review proves the vulnerability of Shanmugams Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam "credited a mistake" or was it a Freuddle?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are considered as independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country the sovereign rights of the city go back to Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equal to land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the government office, the statements by Mr Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapur represent their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our prime minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of one country, or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">The magazine Journey of a Decade to visit Singapore, the journal Journey of a Decade is always a town:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have a lot of Singapur to have annoyed...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a town.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a town / island nation.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements such as" "" "the defence of the country" "" "etc." "" "but that's not quite right." ""</seg>

<seg id="1737">Canadian Ned Flanders.</seg>
<seg id="1738">Screenshot from a YouTube video.</seg>
<seg id="1739">Global Voices recently asked his editors: what is the most missive aspect about your home or homeland?</seg>
<seg id="1740">Their answers are published here as part of a ongoing series, being revealed by rumors of certain parts of the world and a other facet should be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is asked to me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"" "" "" "no, sorry, I answer." "" "I come from Canada." "" "since 1994 I live and again in Japan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on what situation is taking place, it is considered polite to show interest in his conversation partner by answering personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In my clarification then the standard answer is: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians may cook perhaps even in anger when they are kept for Americans, but annoys me not.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag visible well on their rucksack if they are travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">By contrast, Americans....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always worn small maple leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gay marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">Everybody seems to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "sorry."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada also applies to ethnic groups as the tolerant country against ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like those types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends I admire very much.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It would make me nothing, if one would change me with Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc out of Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">"" "but there are also some problems with the stamp" "" "nice" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1768">First: as "nice" to be called, is basically to be spinning - like the goodnatured, gentle, but tragically unimportant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (who has a very own Canadian Doppelgänger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada would really be a nation of people like Ned Flanders, that would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing at which one can pierce.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Be harmless, means inconspicuous, and uninteresting to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">That can be something good, if you want to remain unnoticed in the background, far from the things that are going around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and to be alone, a master of Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own matters.</seg>
<seg id="1775">As an outsider than "nice," maybe just cool politeness.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians do not talk about the fence with the neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We are missing the warm, open kindness, which I now connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice" and our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Music video of a pop-band parodizes Thailands Junta</seg>
<seg id="1780">One in Thailand's famous pop band has released a music video that took power the Junta to restore power in 2014, despite their promises to restore civilian government.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells his rules his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly politically, the music video refers to the persistent military power of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other sites for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days the video was posted on Facebook uploaded video 1.254 and received 8,800 lifts.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, the Charlie Chaplin Video "dictator" in Thailand had even blocked the public after a group of activists presented the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai politics, as special as it behaves with the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Check out these recordings of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand have been beating in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of the girls" may refer to the draconian section 44 of the preliminary constitution, which makes the commander-in-chief of the army's absolute decision on important national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious program for the "establishment of journalists" by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other individuals who are regarded as a critic by the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminal, whose vague and unclear provisions are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army, providing online content and individuals who were accused of having slandered the monarchy, prosecuted criminal law.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand sets a strict observance against "Lese Majeste" (Majesty's Understanding).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, the martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that Junta continues to purchase their decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts are warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax veins.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video, even as persons are thrown into a black delivery van, before you bring them into an interfering camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are sitting in prison because they were supposed to have "confusion" in society and the internet are threatened long sentences, they should insult the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile the Teaser of the song members of the band, which was used to produce Salut "tribute of Panem," which was already used by coup during protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1804">The post-war society is recovering only very slowly in East-East Asia, especially in the Tkuarchal district.</seg>
<seg id="1805">Now over 20 years have passed since the Georgian-demolition war officially ended, but its scars are still very visible in this part of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of northern district in Tkuarchal show distinctive pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are located in the coal basin of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups like Russians, Greeks, atrocities, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked together for Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today live the largest part of the Russians and the chases in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called pious cities in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period, more than 10,000 people lived here. today there are only a few hundred people in these violins.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of 16.000 people had risen after over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989, about 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1894">In Mexico, "Mama Africa is home to their long journey</seg>
<seg id="1895">Concepción González Ramírez leads a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Brack was published on 19 April 2017 at our Partners PRI.org website and published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, some places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Braachula, he is located at the border of Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexicanerin, a small woman with a coral pink light frame and gold coloured earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Brachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a target for Africans and Haitian, who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with bare, crumble walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the entrance there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - even hundreds of African and haired migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Ms Ramírez tells the people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "mum Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you in Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At present, it's more quiet but this year Ramírez received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside of boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">They don't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them to hospital, if they are sick, they buy them medication that they do not pay, they massage them with a balm that exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived before a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui who has a joghurstache) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he responds with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her, as African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, however, it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other companions from Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and Africans often travel together the track and that, the Africans already speak on WhatsApp by Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his signs, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a member of Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez contact with Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," he said smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells her guests to send her often text messages when they have gone to salute them or to report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but their guests have been taught to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known, but it is not the only spark hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city leads a cul to Jesús Valencia.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valencia and his family contributed to the migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and found that bus tickets will be sold to numerous African immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them to get a reasonable price, then he has offered them his home for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly shartians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking area outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valeniela, he knows that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his work.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants traveling by Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to press money without a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he was asked for an accommodation and an unknown, an all-wing, has offered him a roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next step is going to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back to the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses the travellers consult their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Today a minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a majority from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but it is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">She leaves her album with a lot of photos in her album.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair brains that you made a client, some photos of their grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad, while she introduces me briefly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya'fueron" is repeated every time every time. "they have gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication equipment in Xinjang of Twitter users, and that of the well-known turists</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the cell phone users received a mobile phone call in the Tianshan district of Urumqi a cell phone notification, in which it has to install the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">In the message, it is said that the app "is to ensure access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities will also use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they had installed the app using a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the police report that the app would determine the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective performance with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the block of pornographic websites, from online fraud, Trojan and phishing sites to make users attentive as much time they spend online and control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can be naturally used in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" government or even hackers could steer the home network of a person to manipulate or steal it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China mostly concentrate on the experience of the users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict regions, the authorities often classify extreme rists and monitoring measures as well as routinely Internet launts.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Based on Twitter based media outlet, "Images from Mainland China" (An undergoing), the censored news in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where policemen trained to examine whether they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification requested that the people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected on a checkpoint using a device without this software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They are forced to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by regulating technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" (Aduciphony) also published a Jingwang product description, out of the fact that the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system, and therefore unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council, to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government agencies, authorities and with the party connected facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in operation of their computer and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, a US American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the order to all residents and entrepreneurs, until 1 August their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable harddisks, notebooks, and media storage."</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obvious to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." this action, however, violates the personality rights of Urumquis, three million inhabitants, and gives them penalties for a number of other possible delay, including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="1997">One that makes his name honor.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One that has downcast into a list of feelings and expressions that allow no metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">But when you look back the reality and look behind the scenes - across the theater, the beautiful scenes and performers - turn the characters in beings from meat and blood, and everything cries after death.</seg>
<seg id="2000">All doubt come up in smoke, and you will be aware of your existence, even though the Earth is on the axis of the monster, that you are captured here between the walls that your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone are built by stone.</seg>

<seg id="2002">He put his power on us by proof, making it even the easiest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five youngsters were killed during a peaceful protest like darnel from the beautiful garden of our revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was enough to make the city the darkness of the night with "Allahu Akbar" screams.</seg>
<seg id="2005">All the neighborhoods sought after, only my own.</seg>
<seg id="2006">For the first time it was quiet, rainy, at the wrong time, even when I found no high demands on a city, which is to be assigned to the arteries with government security and their accompliments.</seg>
<seg id="2007">During the third night the things had calmed down, after the power supply had heard in the quarter.</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke the silence, I shouted several times "Allahu Akbar" from my house roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice in silence.</seg>

<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was there, as I was now.</seg>

<seg id="2051">It must be around 10 o'clock in the evening; always around this time the screams, every day.</seg>

<seg id="2054">"they are here to be interrogated."</seg>
<seg id="2055">That was the mystery to protect us and prevent the secret safety in front of us and prevent the terrorists in us, they talk in alawitic dialect - so they played their denominational exhaustive card and betrayed the tight view of its world view.</seg>
<seg id="2056">This is no house, which is no country; it is a curse to name them coexistence to transform the crime of their clan into a hero.</seg>
<seg id="2057">I cared for the hearing and meet at Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least, he looks like that.</seg>
<seg id="2058">He begins a "pleasant" conversation, in spite of the expressions that escapes him, "My boy, you are still young, you can set up so much weight with your life than to protest against you and to protest against demonstrations, which will soon be an end."</seg>
<seg id="2059">I don't answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I didn't get used to answer me.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can really no longer say when insults and beats after a friendly conversation have become an ordinary communication tool.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how that happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me told that I had to get used to get used to get punished, although I had done nothing to make this sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2064">At punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to pluck me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the lovingly "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It begins with a plastic pipe, which probably comes from the cloak.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your hen gathers your cry to your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure with him, and you cannot keep your terrors.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My cry did not make him enough, so why they exchanged the tube through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">At my first start, I asked if the investigator had been a garbage collector, or if that was one of the normal working equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had four cables intertwined, to present us the, from their point of view, great invention of a huge Cabel.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour, three of them changed while I was still in the line.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all of my body in my body - and my voice, which is why I heard to cry out.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The Henker noticed the cooling down and did not find an appeal against it, which is why he considered a neighbour to an electrically charged rod.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity flows my whole body, enough to supply my entire district.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My semi-naked body, which was stretched out on the ground, was the perfect circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty to this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep back again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">A few hours passed that came to me like minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens and the morning light meets the room ".Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"" "I reply with the voice of an inexhaustible young people," "" "My lord, my father has to make fearful sorrow." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and get away, you will be moved."</seg>
<seg id="2087">This was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they were always free.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where are they leading me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he shatter on his screen, even to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on, a cigarette between his fingers or his fiddles with nicotine lips can be discovered.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the upper floor of his family house which belonged to them since 1967; the year where Israel had finished its occupation of the West Bank and fled to Hdaibs family in which they lived in Palestine as felahyeen (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist, who has been transferred to the conservative majority, and asks their original opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapesies.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, who often deal with subjects such as Orientalism, racism, and the situation of Palestinian poultry. all of these issues are not only found in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities that reach Damascus in Syria by far to Sanaa.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking through boundaries and he can feel the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not open it, he sweeps against the US-American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe his sympathy for those who are trying to survive in war zones, anything with his identity as "Palestinian poultry manners of the second generation" - so he himself, even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think because of my own lives," Hdaib stresses.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think that because I'm a man," while he poured out the nest café in two cups. it is the sacred month Ramadan; in that time it is intended for Muslims to fasten from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also says that public consumption of food is illegal during the Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for it to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a senate hot Junitag has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the slaughter-warm coffee and the swallows of the Kent-cigarette in the nose are primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when one throws a look into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - to not land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of the Interior has cancelled the performance of the band Mashrou 'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Act - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-army Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert tabs.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the MP and former press for the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "was cancelled" "" "because of the sake of sexual orientation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim that the commitment of the band in affairs such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which represents the well-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement Mashrou'Leila said the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," which continued to continue to use "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is unlikely to be silky rhetoric, but is actually an increasingly obvious reality in Jordan which occurs in Hdaibs Werk clearly.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib came traditional venerable sex caressing, having formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vorehelichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently covered, unknown woman, whose arms and legs are stretching to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of them they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, the number of 'honor' has risen - the inofficial outside left in Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2120">On Human Rights Watch, the number of Honorary Civists reached its peak in 2016, however, that Jordan was lacking institutional infrastructure to support women who tried to support the victims, attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law to Crime Squeepers from 1954, women who are subject to danger of inner-friendly violence, "and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee of family needed, that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known for it, also not shy away from issues that glow in his country as a taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, however, is a dream that he can separate his music, which is full of explicit attacks on sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "" "" "I was inexpressing politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and "Ghareeb" we focus on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs, which are politically, can continue.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, verse is repeated:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, on which one can get, in his words, "it can get what you want" - whether it is faith or not faith, heteroy or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that little one in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on gender equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still strongly censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular jordan Onlineage Roya, to mention that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without incisions, but only one worked version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib acquires open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance about homosexuals do not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuys, a poet of the eighth century who still remained in remembrance today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuys, who should work even on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, did nothing with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert has been canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemitic kingdom, there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are being put to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian News Service adopted several former government officials and members of the teaching association, with the reasoning, which comments on comments in social media critically related to problems linked to the deep in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Given the show of Hdaibs's opinion only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to influence a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him there is progress and take progress. Jordan has managed Mashrou'Leila again for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - so it looks Hdaib - consists of slow, bedtime and internal changes. he is sure that these changes will be held every day at the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib dreams, such as millions of other Arabs also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not just dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them to experience "them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is characterized by music, art and literature with real and fundamental openness - not by bombs, streetunitions, and artificial kind of democracies. at least, he hopes.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until now, Hdaib will continue, and thus also resist resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These great, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is believed that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival that is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. a further theory states that the festivities, the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years came across and from one time descended to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to force the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could grab a couple of great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A shared centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (litertl).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking forward to the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two buggy are just visible.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only True - and a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Sommerfestival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The view of an 18-meter high festival was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let us enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, external apparition and body care were as important as in this history, because it helps to keep the Peruvian youth from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hair of hair.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus main harbour, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic centre of Lima's capital Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where road crashes and illegal drugs are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">During the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - rising demand for men's aesthetic services.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles by famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), or Neymar (Brazil), led to the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the utmost limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts against each other to show those who can create the excentrist Looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions there is on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as Augusto Salazar Bondy, who is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to exchange young people against barber tools and instead of bad advice to find a training in hairdresser architecture that enables them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and offer possibilities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job, who is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year, and reported on some of her achievements:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only specialist school in the community and the district, which we are very proud, because of love to the children we built this educational community.</seg>

<seg id="2181">The following articles is the worked version of the "Liebesbotanic" of guerrillas, "which has published an international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here in a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important, people who are extinct, affection to this affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is exactly the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Young-Youth Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation, and inspired her to write his campaign "cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconcile) to write the young people.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently it was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had closed a peace agreement with the guerilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered the signing of peace agreement as so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Before Colombia is still a long way until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillakras, who lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to a rhetoric of war and, around the clock, they have to integrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, in turn, struggled to life in constant fear and in some cases, deepened hatred toward guerrillas, these have to support them in their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that young columnist could join together and would have to help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrillas, to welcome them back into society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrillas - who will then be handed over.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation was made at the World Summit of Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there were Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to talk to Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This declared that we love the people we love to write on the day's Day of love letters, but those who forget them need much need.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plane, he continued to share his love with people this year, which needed in the most urgent need.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was created to write letter full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, which will now find their place in society and create a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought that someone would be forgiven '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogotart traveled to the camp to make the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC felt so on how they had done before in order to meet the orders of their leader.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they had no orders, but letters full of subsidy from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all those involved. "it is incredible how many different feelings come through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is in between," said the President Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had handed over the letters, a former fighter carried me through the camp of guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of cottage in which the guerrilla struggles) saw, I saw a guerrillas who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because besides him on the bed a MGL-pomegranate, a lethal weapon in the thorn.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "and I said to him," "" "Hello, what are they doing now?" "" "he answered," "" "I reply to a letter which somebody has written." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It's a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life, somebody has written something so beautiful, that's why I reply to that. "suddenly I ran our tears on the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely, and set me beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for war, it was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighting, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected something different from life than war. the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before starvation. "I never thought someone would be forgiven for my mistake.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have learned how I need to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace rules, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the kick-off students and some leader of the FARC joined a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all raised as early as war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC proclaimed the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insights into their views on the peace process: "for many years, we witnessed the opportunity to develop a political party, we can also contribute to the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a goal of this figure, it is worth to overcome all obstacles, "one of them said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people who have never found hearing, and had no electoral law, and that people who I often had seen as a monster, and even hate those who were turned around by their lives and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, will hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me, that all men - including those who have caused, and caused much harm to us, and give us a smile and hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the camp of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example, Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the City of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The column was made, according to the disarmament of peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to attack and protesting the weapons and that's totally justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we from the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifice, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. among us who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be coming.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ system in Chechnya has captured the international headlines in several months ago, after reports were published, which were the deterioration, torture and killing of queerer men in the Republic of thematise.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Novaya Gazeta; it threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who took suspected queens and put them in secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which was why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechnya had experienced the sexual harness of their land, the hunt was opened to Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">From fear to life her life attracted it to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day, I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend of Dagestan, a transwoman who checked in difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, he did a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere in the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen Friends, with the following message: "then there is no men more in Chechnya that can eliminate these disgrace?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents made the round about the whole of WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">I was attacked on 10 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was doing just a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a men's voice saying: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt a bit in my body, but I didn't hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a set, but this time on Chechen: "how long do you still want to honour the family, you sneak?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't recognize the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that there was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>

<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had heard everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>

<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are dated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor stood and put me to the women.</seg>

<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has changed respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">In the last February, I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some remote relatives.</seg>

<seg id="2286">OC Media: how does your family have to deal with this print?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's always hard for them.</seg>

<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with a darkened windowls and a plate shield with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After the third time, it was clear to me that something lazy was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked out the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to offer their names, but I will say that I remember all of them. they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registration, without identification, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I checked the SIM card to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you do not believe, you warmest in safety, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you wake up. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about sexual activity, however, this is a table theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements are still alive in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I desire it, I cannot overcome this secular barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chatting with camera, I actually give up trouble as the person seeing them from her past - so on my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that's very hard.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who have stayed?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked with somebody who has a one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during the Ramadan were not arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of the Ramadan could hardly wait to wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely, they are now concentrating on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So I mean, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person, and at the end demand an evidence that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood genuggation.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are males still held in these secret prisons now?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says that there would not be many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relations or were dropped from their relatives to put Kadyrows's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there, so they can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim they would have attacked any village or military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">You understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but specifically dipped to radicalise itself.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that only a assumption or have you a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote somebody who was imprisoned in Argun for a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new of them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And so called Lord, this person himself was, when these men were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not presented as bandits, there were no reports so far. we suggest that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could it not allow these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think, even before 2003 I was already known in Grozy when I lived there - and I never had trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia was initially wanted to bring us to" "" "civilisation" "", "but ultimately cast us back into the stone time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were slipped; I had coloured eyelashes, wearing tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The safety of the Scharia has never touched me just a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grozy there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people as me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and all the city knew it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a language of speech: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "don't talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say it often, when they are fun over the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply shut up their eyes in front of you, because they believed you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never been offended, never hunted and never routed.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long kept this mercy time?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us by se, but rather over the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel like people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who had laughed and laughed at once, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic could steadily be worse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you move now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I still worked as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I agree with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacreffs, gatherings, I join them to the hospital and help them to get dining out cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself, when I abapperched a fluence.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and would help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: wear a Hidalab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is alright.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So is nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That is exactly the same as Chechnya that you want to know with foam in front of the mouth, that there is no gay among them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have those who have the Cabardiner, those who have the Russians, on the whole planet it is, but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, that's why it is unpleasant to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practiced Muslims who go to the mosque and during the Ramadan fasten - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know, many think about Transitional identity to men who love men, and they believe that you're going to transform his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a guile.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of emotion to be accurate, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Don't know if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I'm here personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am myself myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of self-morden within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">For the past few months there is a strong increase of self-mornings.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photograph of the Arab worker in Iran was provided by the patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man called Jassim Moramazi on 27 August the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered under anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability of his family to come up, such as Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video filmed on YouTube was the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly made it quickly to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Talegant hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the internal combustion were so strong that doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide which happened in August within the Arabian Ahwazi minority, and activists warn the place that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month, some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - heard this month.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: all the family fathers, who felt because of persecution by the Iranian government, helpless and unable to pursue their families and pursue a safe job.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a majority of Iran live in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to deny their livelihood of living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and took a great efforts to finish ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most populated and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, regional economy continues to be slow, and the local population receives only little of that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and discharge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denied the Ahwazi-Arabians systematically trusses local jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of combs, the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are diverted.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have led only to destroy the devastation in the region, causing local agriculture, as well as fish and palm trees in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among Arabian Ahawzi's adolescents now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director of cooperation, work and social welfare, announced that 5% of Ahwazis who completed primary school, completed 55% of a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "Systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the mind of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of self-murder under the young Ahwazi-men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially unemployment has become worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic ethnic Persians and anti-Arab Discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions do not prefer the Arabic workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deferred access to labour services in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of ruling regime which aims to destroy the mind of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their lives outside of their home Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their ancestor and surname to hide their affiliation to Ahwazi, and so that the Arab names will not be tolerated at the workplace, the speech of the Arabic language or the Arabic language of Arabic.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the conditions given to Arab Ahwazi, human rights activists beat the alarm before the situation is explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait, if the world is waking up and knowing thereof.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion that was written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afroféminas website. this article was an object of several discussions where many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I am not a feminist, many women, especially white women, who represent themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">You are wondering why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even do well-reasoned scientific and social arguments from me why I should be a feminist and why we generally do all feminists *.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women still earn less money in spite of the same education as men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women still stand under strict observation, when it comes to what they are allowed to do with her body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women are sooner or later in various areas of life to a glar blanket, and that discrimination based on gender are still across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: if I have to talk on skin color, racism, black women in black women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women, on what kind of we have been misused, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists were silent to mention many white feminists and white intersectional feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women - should come together to "sing their voices and 'Kumbaya,' to sing 'their vote' to reach Gender equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that in addition to sexualised violence, a institutional form of racist motivated violence, which we are exposed to black women on two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or above that black women and women of other ethnic and country of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The fact that black girls and girls with migrant backgrounds are more often condemned to school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with migrant backgrounds are exposed to higher risk, domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the other hand, I want all women, all men and all humans are not connected to the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join a movement as a black woman, who refuses to consider unjust injustices in their thinking that relate to the gender as well as to the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and I will not have to fight my affiliation in a white-feminist sphere that always has rejected me and countless others black women and always rejected.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "he complained in 1851 in her speech:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I refuse to maintain a ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginal beings" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to connect my groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs, in order to drive your egozentrisky program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">"" "" "" "I will not try to lay white women the importance of the grounding of skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to revive them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded in order to limit women of different information and limits itself from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself full and full of feminism and decided to insert the movement of the Womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women in our own ideas and give us into the spheres that will be created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book of African womanism: Recording Ourselves (e.g.: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves, in which they are perfectly safe in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered to the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately summing up, separating these lines, please let me know about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I existed.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and due to my existence as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment that doesn't exceed my life nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2469">In the past 7 years, Nabil Musa traveled again in the past 7 years - mostly with a surf board or in canoe. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa, who explains to us its relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on its municipality.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river we had lost than I was a child," she tells Musa.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from the whole country fear that the decades of war, construction of dust, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the non-governmental organization Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - which is committed to protect the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of this natural resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2474">At the end of the video, Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in a question: "if we had no water more, how would we survive?"</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and worked version of the article "The Wave of Violence against Women in Paraguay" of turally. the article is part of the series # PorSerMujer (# refuted) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police officer said Ada Báez, that she had nothing to do against Luis Balbuena, her former partner who had become violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship was past and the police said that their testimony would be laid to the acts, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman Balbuena was charged with mistreatment, the acute display of Ada Báez did not use anything.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second wife moved their display.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking up the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women have shown at all, they will generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women also are financially dependent on the men that they abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who have to admit victims of violence against the law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Accounting and Statistic 2 Invisible mitigation and a legal system, which is nothing less dimmt3 levels of laws: good base, deficient implementation blows and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really misused, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social research institute in Paraguay. "there are different information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the Office of Attorney General Assembly imposed 9600 ads because of domestic violence. at 70% of them it went to violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads came by police.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence among the peace parties. 86% of the ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">This statistics, however, do not show the true magnitude of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi actually displayed only few of these offenders. "on every woman, who will be refunded in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "every woman who is refunded because of physical abuse are two women who do not do this," "" "she explained to the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">As the murder of women in Paraguay was not an independent attorney, prosecutions authorities cannot be documented every year from their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay, every ten days a woman dies due to violence committed by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that takes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez was the fixed friend of Carlos Vera, insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but after that, it should repent.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos, but for two years she endured the psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and simultaneously the most severe recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would become a victim of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it before, I always thought that only women are going to be submissive, because they are fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana is used to report social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated it.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos myself. he asked rhetorisch, whether he ever raised the hand against her, and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked to Mariana why she had fallen so long of Carlos and left him not earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have some complicity in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner did abuse them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te CREO network ("I believe you"), which consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can speak with others about their experiences, listening to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case, everything began with psychological mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner even managed to convince her to convince her that it was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started to beat them.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his permission</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need of medically medically medically medical research: for one of them missing in the offer of global healthcare, many medicines and vaccines which cover the special medical needs on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have a major problem in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investments in the research of these diseases caused by the pharmaceutical companies.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is carried out by African scientists for its own research capacity in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the Centre for research regarding infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic for first gratifying impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched himself at the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and on misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research theme?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus of my work on the application of research results. I support the sambarian national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I also launch a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB, and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion about major scientific topics in your country and in general Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only employ solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always stay recipients, instead of being Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get, often are not good in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">Projects are well-funded differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who come back or want to move forward, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, exploration of the world, healthcare (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa from Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, there are limited speed, things to do, and the value access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are only accessible against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seeds will change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as outredder, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was made only by its own infancy and the question of how many types of salads can get boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he realized that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to breach them.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only available for individual types, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or coiled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past years, more such patents have been registered on ever more plants like grain or cartons. based on this trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia tradition, Morton still takes a salad, but meanwhile he needs longer, because his work is still more difficult due to more limitations.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like a rock brocken in a river in order to pump out." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do this now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think these patents go well to salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they withstand before the court, no one can breed a new salad variety because all the features are already patented. "he makes as good as possible and tries to breed those features that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement, which is getting bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" breeder).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the international space station ISS have bred red Roman salat of the variety outreddish in the "greenhouse" of the station and eaten. there will be tested if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like it would come from the IT-area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open Source" seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" software, which provides alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was set up in order to ensure that some plant species and landmarks are not protected as intellectual property and are thus used for plantations.</seg>
<seg id="2646">Under the initiative, called Ossi, US breeder can undertake that others may be able to use farmed seeds free of them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeder allow only others to breed it to breed it, and not immediately exploit - two aspects that are banned by many plant patties or prescribed by many plant patties.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Bleak prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emerials professor of University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi, board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds plays to him a role in larger clashes such as biodiversity, rights of peasants, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeder would try to kill the latter not or only little, raising seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "Open Source" movement is not employed with genetically modified crops.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "to achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, the recent examples of consolidation of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, as well as it is offered to farmers markets, should also know how this vegetables is bred, threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereign without seeds is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the open source Seed initiative undertake a commitment to others their seed remains free to provide. so, as opposed to it, seed and plant features are patented.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi-supporters argued that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available genzepool is due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights to plant material, which is therefore always available, unceforth.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, the director of the Ossi, has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one-third of all competition features as intellectual property is protected, making it either not even usable for plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, there are still no estimates, but experts like Luby suggests that massacred plants such as wheat in even larger style are patented as salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visials</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred so they have targeted features - of such as their taste or their colour improves up to such, because of which they prosper in certain environments, and threats as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeder is increasing by ever more patents. genetic variety is currently necessary than ever before, since the changed conditions are worse than ever worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto's spokesperson Carly Scaduto recognise that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for monthly activities. with a total of four genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural company of the United States set the company for maintaining the genetic variety.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts, however, that the intellectual property could promote other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant-related innovation." "a patent is basically taken as a plan that everyone can follow soon as soon as the patent is expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often, these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not support innovation, but support them by public more material and know-how is provided. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it's different: 20 years to wait until a patent loop, certainly no innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for so long to breed in plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the battle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resource has always been a general well-well and it also ought to remain: "independent plant breeding have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">That is what drives us, and it is impossible to use us if we don't continue to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton interferon with the concept to patented plant features: "we are not creating the characteristics itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it itself and as breeder, we finally have no idea how plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and Ossi, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "if anyone breeds a variety, its own values also in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation you need to be needed by herbicides, brewing in its varieties of agriculture in agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exact. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but less than Monsanto are) patents, there are most smaller seeds, even without any patents, either they reject the patented or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">Frank Morton's independent plant breeder is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the opinion that breeders would be characterized by avoiding plant patties: "it looks like being with my efforts to produce new things, stronger than companies that are patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties into a couple of years, "he says." with a patent is protected for 20 years before the competition, wherewith my opinion makes it very beautiful. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the United States appear to be a leader in the "Open Source" breeding, the concept is spreading quickly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the area of resources, works in the centre with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that fulfill certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports it to "Open Source" seed to come and sell her own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"" "the German organisation" "" "Agrecol is working on an" "" "open source" "" "license which ultimately became a formless and legally binding form of Ossi obligation for breeder in the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding themselves distinguish themselves from country to land, absent by Ossi obligation not simply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">In early November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission declared that conventionally farmed plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks to the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allowed patents on conventional cultivated plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">"" "" "" "a statement is not yet no law; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bringing the Patent Office to implement this new line." ""</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016 the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, on farmers, operators and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the "open source" seed movement and the global trend towards the basis of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for the "Open Source" program for "Open Source" seeds, explains that the organization is currently a worldwide alliance for "Open Source" seed systems, for which scheduled next year will be the official starting signal.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental and development groups (including Hivos, international non-profit-development aid organisation USC Canada and the Action Group to erosion, Technology and Concentration) compiled a database about seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Essence - a consortium of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - represent a report that farmers have to maintain, exchange, and improve the seed policy, that ensures a stable care of food products.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report, the importance of a diverse, local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems is emphasized - a connection, by Luby von Ossi, hopes to see him soon more people.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has been thinking about where and how something is grown, and seed systems have barely played a role," so Luby. "we now try to clear the people that there is still more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still unlocking the Egyptian authorities content online.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of August, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt, as well as the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities criticised and criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step, and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information bleibt- despite this attack and the violation of the Egyptian right and the Constitution to defend this goal, so it was never so important as now. ANHRI confirmed that all the technical possibilities will be exhausted to overcome the distortion and not to admit. we insisted on to fulfil our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored site of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after blocking the authorities more than two months ago 21 websites, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, arabic-speaking edition of Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the shaft of the website. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI also consists of the blog of columnist and Human Rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada no access in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog on the spread of Colombia and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now, the blog, whom he addressed to circumvent the interest apparatus of the Egyptian government, even target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with which also Ziadas blog is home, however, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported about the student protests and took a video how the police practise physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly turning around politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment Ziada said to the lock through the government and reflected what this signifies for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The, blogs to unlock is very old but has priority in the era of deldelfattah al-Sisi. and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaningless for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It managed to give me the feeling of a siege resistance; an arrest, an attempted murder, charge of the national Security Council, the blocking blogs and any other site, for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write free in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to the post of articles to avoid censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave are walking the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities closed their websites from 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. these are technical tests on the networks of different Internet service providers (ISP), among others Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the distortion of providers, through the transfer of internet censorship and private surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in its research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we saw how the blocking of websites, VPNs, began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practices indicates the purpose of the government to block content and filter content, to access the Egyptian user.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is provided in addition to the fact that the decision decisions are taken behind closed doors, which the Egyptian population has no legal basis, through which they can proceed against this actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government to go with censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">Argue the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army in the favela housing in Niterói, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day for day report newspapers in Brazil with a gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to many postcard designs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old shot in school," "" "Jeanne's second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro," "" "Serve rough pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and Air Force to Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">"" "" "" "in the middle of the economic crisis and in an accrued financial situation the violence wave of 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are allunacceptable and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">So, for the detailed reporting on violence in the Rio known newspaper "Extra" on 16th August the Editorial "That is not normal," in which it announced to establish a new column called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in town are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision declared the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes committed in any major city on the world as murder, smokers, sexual crimes, etc. everything that happens in Rio is published in the heading "War in Rio" (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so that we do not close our eyes in front of the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, chief editor of the newspaper that this decision was no occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war in a country that does not know the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist wrote that it is according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro's 843 territories that are controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the Editorial the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war exchange rate, when it is distorted, can also be used to interrogate grausal bodies of the police, who only shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partner.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" more than it profit?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira is argued that violence as "war." in their opinion, it was a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to put responsibilities at the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra during the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with inadequate investment in personnel, education, and historical and self-counterfeit neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the Rio de Janeiro's state is greater than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando Frazão / Agência Brasil. publication with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil," according to Cecília, is false: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie according to statistics from 2015 to the north and north east of the country. these are the most recent data available.</seg>
<seg id="2778">No such cities is located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">When we look at the murder rate per state, Rio is on No.16, "she writes.</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to the Global Globo company, the largest media company South America, which emphasises the security policy of the state for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Among these safety policy measures, the founding of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), one of the federal state of Rio in 2003, whose goal is to conquer a massive police force a favela and to take a unit permanently there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this was actually led to a decrease of non-violent deaths. in some years, the UPP has been able to protect against poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit, increasingly under fire.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux made from one of his article published in 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the designation "Civil War."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio serves as a result of serious consequences for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this calls for the state to use funds and ways that are typical for a war. this includes intrusion into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and the object for "collateral harm" and "distorted balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War, or ago, fact is that the inhabitants of the favela is still suffering in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week ago it is now that the police have climbed up the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: an oreller died due to shots that had fired the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly through the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, are located in Damascus and surrounding country, Homs, Deir ez, and Idlib currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region of East Ghouta, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition, are based on the basis of UN sanctions and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these areas controlled areas controlled by Damascus under siege under siege, which led to some people related to rural areas or tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the longlade blockade, traditional food products such as meat have become unreachable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">In contrast, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas how they can plant their own mushrooms as "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnear and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Fungi do not belong to the most common, in Syria, and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine. however, its foodstuff makes them too an attractive source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Directly of the project, the Nabil Sanad, said in comparison to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organisers, reports Global Voices that has been fighting for three years, making this project acquainted and pressed his relief that it is now more and more "to gain popularity."</seg>
<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, use in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnear as the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families to the planting pilgrims, Dr. Leila towards Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700, but will earn donations on CanDo by Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity with 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortages, it is used locally manufactured from plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with the" "" "production from the regions, the fungal seeds," "" "before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom yard in a bowl. when this was achieved, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"" "now they have designed a" "" "educational farm for the region." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the start of the project and after 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>
<seg id="2824">"" "" "" "we want to teach people of the fungal for various reasons" "" ": breaking the siege." ""</seg>

<seg id="2832">Portuguese demand justice for victims of the fires of 2017</seg>
<seg id="2833">Several hundred people were protested in many neighbourhoods in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for victims of fires that grated in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Two-two people died and about 70 injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October. this led to the government out of solidarity with the victims of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire eruptions that spread across the northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, in Pedrógão Grande it occurred a similar tragedy, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forestry surveillance system that monitors land surfaces by satellite photos, in Portugal alone around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of Lisbon's Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the situation: there is no fire only in 4 districts.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Portugal is burnt in the true sense of the word # PrayForPortugal - nata (@ a _ ataner) October 15, 2017</seg>
<seg id="2841">Some of Twitter users divided up pictures:</seg>
<seg id="2842">This is Braga tonight. # PrayForPortugal # Braga # FogosPT</seg>
<seg id="2843">Numerous videos are spreading in the web and show images that allow better insights into the events:</seg>
<seg id="2844">The destiable tragedy</seg>
<seg id="2845">The objective of protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People asked why the civil protection was not able to prevent the extent of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral from the Confederation of Farmers of Portugal declared the Público newspaper:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After Pedrógão, roads and villages were evacuated for anything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did not find it anywhere: there are dozens of stories of open roads which were enclosed by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">In the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy could happen in June, since the streets were very late. "</seg>
<seg id="2851">In addition, construction permits will be consulted with a high risk of fire.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A broad proposal on the forest-form, which had brought the government following serious breaches in the years 2003 and 2005, was prompted by communes that the new rules saw an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law, which allowed the applicant of the case to self-protection - that was an open back door, so that everything could be built," João Sorval leads to the same article in the paper Público.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus made sure that large areas with eucalyptus trees made of slightly inflammable wood, as in a vicious circle, is always spreading on the fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">These problems come to the problem that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, were searching for information or attempted to contact members.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time over the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched by the developers João Pina in 2015 to simplify the work of the fire brigades and was so decisive in this fateful weekend in October so that the servers of the 400,000 users who pursued the fires stopped, there were more than half a million requests.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In one night in the autumn of 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years ago, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin group, which had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. in this way, Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Just at that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner together.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother doesn't say it then, she knew she would not see her son a very long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning dawn, the boy was to break up.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the Schlepres.</seg>

<seg id="2883">CC-2.0</seg>
<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hazara-e-Wahdat party had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara felt shelter suddenly.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban were getting closer to the Hazara-known Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">After his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan again.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a cohort. work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and towed bags with mortar, who were heavier than himself to make his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, as today, the lives of Afghan refugees in Iran was influenced by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf reminded in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, which we worked well.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we hanged nylon in front of open windows, so that we cannot freeze in the night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without Papers in Iran and made herself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">In the dangerous crossing of the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf returned to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharaf homeless, walking alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks, and went to a church that divided twice on the day food.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is due to relatively high awareness quotas a kind of second chance for timely asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions, the asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of the asylum seekers will be accommodated in more than 3000" "" "special events" "". "this is an improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can then be allocated for asylum in a recording centre, if it's official request for asylum - which may take up for months after the registration of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation, either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So also Ahaaf departed.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his untearthly life of life helped Asharaf to free himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After spending several years working in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf raised his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel, and opened a fast climate.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis Success Story now is the theme of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award 2017, which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghanistan are living in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some of Afghanistan-driven companies developed, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Oriental Experience, in which the Kellner and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts the history of their journey to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
