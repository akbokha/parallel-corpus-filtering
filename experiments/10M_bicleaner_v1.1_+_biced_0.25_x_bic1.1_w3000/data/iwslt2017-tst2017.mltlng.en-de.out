that is James R@@ isen .
you may know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times reporter .
long before someone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book written in which he was spectacular that the NSA did illegal teleph@@ ones from Americans .
but it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
therein , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US secret service , in which the CIA had literally sur@@ passed its designs for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know whom the chapter did not feel right ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years the government was determined against R@@ isen and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he became a symbol for the patterns of the government , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , and to s@@ wir@@ ling journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right , if media do not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the mu@@ te , they offer .
so , when the government dropped anchor in R@@ isen , he did something that many brave rep@@ orters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was living with the risk to go into prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they were for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped .
the reason : in time of electronic monitoring , the rep@@ orters and sources can always be defeated .
instead of failure and irrit@@ ability to make statements , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his permission , secretly married his telephone calls ,
just like its e @-@ mail information , financial and banking information , its lending information , and even travel tips with the list of its flights .
in the midst of these information they found evidence that used them to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ w@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and risk of thought to condemn .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too busy as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about National Security was the result of having a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower came to a journalist .
thus , we use the press coverage of the game , which should be protected by the first constitutional law , because the government has more possibilities to sp@@ elling all .
but just as technology of the government allowed to handle rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and indeed , they can contact them from the moment they contact , rather than in the after@@ math .
today , there are communication software that had not existed when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is considerably more secure than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
one such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source @-@ crossing system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the website of Aaron swar@@ ms , which was developed by us today from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , such as the Washington Post .
there you can also instantly upload or send documents , like any ordinary contact form .
these will then be encrypted and saved on a server , to which only the specific news agency has access .
so the government cannot provide any more information in secret , and many of the information they would like would not be available from the outs@@ et .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole , to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are always developing new spy technologies that are all vulnerable to us .
it is to ensure that not only technology denom@@ in@@ ers like Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to kill abuse . it is just as important that we can protect the next whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers ,
the over abuse during the supply of soldiers must be modest and reported by over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker , the alarm to contam@@ inated water from Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ enstein @-@ Insider , who warns us in front of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies have not only been made for those who want to exp@@ ose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thanks .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the largest data back of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that Rei@@ che and M@@ ight &#93; have been hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we beg@@ ged Robert Pal@@ mer by Global Wit@@ ness to a statement . &#93; This week we were greeted by news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s based law firm Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot;
in fact , we actually see e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this already has its first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has stepped down .
also , there are reports that a ban on the brutal Syrian dictator of Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s post@@ war companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens has .
it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin is leading to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others that wait nerv@@ ously to the next release , and to the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems we@@ eps away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , streets .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens will be used by some very few , to hide and eff@@ et their assets -- something that we are discussing and unv@@ eil them for ten years .
I think many people read this whole world very conf@@ using , and it is hard to understand how this tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so , one company in another company , in another company , in another company that makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones .
it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters .
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US .
probably , because there were no prominent Americans in these revel@@ ations that occurred in this sc@@ andal .
now it is not so that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a dat@@ le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States .
in fact , it is so that in some US states need fewer information , less information is required to set up a company than to obtain a library ID .
this kind of transparency in the United States allowed the employees of school districts , subject to school children .
it has been allowed to zoom out especially vulnerable investor .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a hidden investig@@ ators into the offices of 13 Law@@ yers in Manhattan .
our investigations gave himself as African ministers who wanted to bring susp@@ ects money into the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked us that everyone could make suggestions for a lawyer , how he could transfer his money .
these were all pre @-@ pre@@ fers . none of these lawyers participated as clients , and of course no one has handed over money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer , who spread out our hidden investig@@ ators .
it is not a single leader , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it &apos;s about how the system works , established through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty , and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
this may sound very different , as if we could do nothing against it , as if nothing has changed ; as if it is always the rich and weal@@ thy .
but as a new@@ born optim@@ ist I see that there has been quite a lot to change .
over the past few years we have seen incident to more transparency , regarding the owners of companies .
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has been captured in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US came down here .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill into two par@@ liament@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as an agent in order to ensure more transparency in the United States and globally .
for us with Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are mad if they see how other people can hide their real identity behind hypo@@ crit@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the business which stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end the laws of this kind of transparency .
together , we can finally end the In@@ transparency , who now allow this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ undering .
this is the story , as I was almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
a day after I completed my design studies , I made a rear sale .
a type in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked up my stuff .
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . after that , he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans that . I don &apos;t want to get kidnapped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have a air@@ bed . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a voice in my head said , &quot; Go , how please ? &quot;
at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed on the ceiling , and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what happened to me there ?
a wild beast sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , ti@@ pped on toe peaks at the door , and my bedroom door closed .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the artwork he bought from me is today in his class@@ room . he is teacher now .
that was my first experience as hosts . it has changed my viewing angle completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood , actually friends who were waiting for it to be discovered ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
to accommodate people on my air@@ bags , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air matt@@ resses .
let us take a leap forward , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my room@@ mates , and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked .
I think creativity can create it , be afraid to transform .
I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ches@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment will stay at a designer bed bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk inclusive , with a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created such &quot; Air@@ ports and Breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep at a wooden floor for 20 dollars .
they thought it was great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all over the city . when we passed our last guest and passed the door to the castle , Brian and I arrived .
had we just discovered that at the same time we find new friends and could pay for rent our rent ?
things came into rolling .
my former fellow worker , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
so we presented ourselves to investors : &quot; we want to create a website , looking to public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms , whose doors are closing , when visiting us .
on the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the missile would ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
nobody who is still in consol@@ ation would be investing in a business , allowed a stranger to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we have learned , as children , strangers are dangerous .
when you have a problem , you are thinking about things that can be good . we could designer .
at the Academy of Art we learned that design is much more than just a look and h@@ ap@@ tic -- it is the overall experience .
we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create under design immense confidence , between people who never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I want to give you a sample , which degree we em@@ bal@@ m .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up , if you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I want to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked cell phone to your left seat .
this quiet suit of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
for the only thing that is still personal as your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
so the most guests feel when they sleep elsewhere .
only for this reason , our company can exist .
just so , who now has Al Go@@ res Mobile ?
could you please tell us on Twitter that it dict@@ ates to the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
you have experienced what kind of trust we want to build on . I want to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first presented with his name ; if he would have told what he comes , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine that you would have 150 ass@@ essments , all of them say : &quot; he can really hold fast cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
a well @-@ thought feedback system strengthens trust significantly .
at the beginning , we have done some things wrong .
it was hard to give people negative ass@@ essments .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest were given their ass@@ essments before we presented them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people rely on each other , depending on how they are dealing with age and place .
little surprisingly , we trust the people most , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social default .
it is exciting if you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by ass@@ essments .
if one has less than three beats , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation is out of simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ ferences .
moreover , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you are priced .
here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
when you tell too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
one tells too much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also not accepted .
so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enness , such as &quot; Great artwork in your apartment ! I &apos;m making holidays with my family holiday . &quot;
how can I create it with design , making this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
with which we had not reck@@ oned , the great amount of people who were more than willing to deposit these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
firstly : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need , which had not been covered before .
for us , business is very good for us .
of course , there are times , if not all goes smoothly .
there were guests who are un@@ allowed to celebrated parties or apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly on my mobile phone .
I stood at the fore@@ front front , when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts if I think only remember .
the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller , was , and will always be our biggest motivation to improve us further .
fortunately , only one fra@@ ction had a problem of the 123 million nights .
for people confi@@ ded to each other .
if trust works , you can create won@@ dro@@ us works .
one of our guests made vacation in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his hosts drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who are incl@@ ined because of sitting activities on heart attacks .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real gu@@ ardian angel who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know a right hand .
they drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books over .
you can stay one even longer without calcul@@ ating extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , of course not every stay .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
for the first time I stum@@ bled about this concept , I asked myself :
how does the thought of the part with money transactions fit together ?
it is here a economic trade .
but it just is simply &quot; ten@@ ding industry &quot; to call it , the thing is not fair .
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
humans put a part of itself open , and this changes everything .
when you travel nowadays , this is to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what would , however , if traveling is a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at each place you visit , a group would be waiting to fill a group there , fill a thoroughly and show in a bar @-@ pent@@ our neighborhood , one of which one has never heard .
or if you want to cook from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to privacy rights .
what if we would like to make apartments for sharing ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thought of shared share ?
I introduce cities which allow us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and amor@@ tis@@ ation .
in South Korea , Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces which belonged to the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a stay ,
they were medi@@ ated to people whose children were moved out . they were incub@@ ator programs ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be able to host a stranger or even host in 191 countries .
the idea seems to be so crazy , as it was taught .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality also gave it before .
there were already similar websites before us .
so why did our work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome deep root pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I like it aston@@ ishing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes to me .
we know , of course , design does not solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had these great influence , I wonder what we can use design shortly .
thanks .
what do you think when you watch me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a bra@@ ins under@@ wear , a terrorist act ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is actually true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
a study concluded that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met Muslims as well : it is great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I &apos;m a mother , a coffee maker -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ al@@ ant fitness fan@@ atics ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ n me .
no , not as homosex@@ ual men , as some of my friends , but as the Muslim . I decided to bear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist bid for me , and on the pressure that I felt like 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not just accepted the faith of my parents .
I have with the Koran .
I read it , thought , asked , doub@@ ted , and finally believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and lon@@ ely dedication that deep@@ ened with each reading of the Kor@@ an .
the beauty of rhythm is sometimes bringing me to weeping .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone you perceive , you fully understand , and yet in love ?
it feels like that .
later , I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as engineering .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had at the end of a piece , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking News . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people split from buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock turned rapidly into indig@@ nation .
why should I do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; I switched to the TV channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u transformed me the deeds of others of a civil war into a suspect .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle East of the United States to move into a new city and begin working with the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I am silent -- as we were silent -- so deep it went to my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as the Muslim .
we went to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that discussed : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d cau@@ tious , &quot; &quot; lead in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be ashamed . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day , where Muslims gather for prayer .
and once again the war@@ nings : &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ il@@ ted and I heard from attacks on Muslims or people who kept for Muslims , free and struck .
there was really bran@@ dan@@ gling on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt really good .
because people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I have vent@@ ured the rage of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain itself continually .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations , which are hard .
nowadays we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in that country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want Muslims to ban Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the United States .
it just raises the question : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and ben@@ ign tumour only under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the United States , but an important organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ fer and Paralymp@@ ics .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make a safer place ?
it may be a few parking fre@@ y @-@ old , but not stop terror .
the regular visiting of a mosque leads to consider people of other faith toler@@ ant , and show larger civil participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not being radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ alised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
during the radic@@ alization process , it is determined that it will start online . as a result , the person is cut off from their church , so that the person believes that the extreme group believes the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or from faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we need to stop the people to go to the mosque .
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS remains its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to us into their prec@@ urs@@ or , if you acknowledge them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology in their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
but if one throws a look at them , they don &apos;t drive them what they read in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Im@@ am has recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him , because she meets the IS .
I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said that the problem was just the opposite . every cl@@ ergy , with whom she had spoken , brought her to silence , and said that her anger , her sense of in@@ justice in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
inspired by nothing , and that of their anger was given , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alisation of extre@@ mi@@ sts who were talking a solution .
this be@@ am asked the connection to God and her church .
instead of acc@@ use her for her anger , he demonstrated her construc@@ tive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept trying to join the IS .
that was an insight , like the Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family concerned .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy , on our freedom of thought ?
a study -- actually several neu@@ rosci@@ enti@@ st studies -- demonstrate : if we fear ourselves , at least three things happen .
we rather accept a author@@ itarian government system , con@@ form@@ ity , and pre@@ ju@@ dice .
a study shows : when you report test subjects , in which negative about Muslims were reported , they are rather military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
when you look at the mood against Muslims - between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the advance of the war and during two electoral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to the Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to increase the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear sh@@ es us all .
for the assignment of collec@@ tiv@@ ism , it is not only about to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .

he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person he knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was start@@ led and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when should I become such a sealed young man from my opinion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Suz@@ anne at her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as if he had posted utter@@ ances against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot at De@@ ah for eight times .
fan@@ atism cannot only be imm@@ oral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or did we stay at home safely ?
we discuss it and for us it was not easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave our children : one that would be able to control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we decided for the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove silent , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , and went out my shoes , and went into the building hall , and what I saw , left me .
the hall was completely filled .
then , Im@@ am made an announcement , than@@ ked and welcomed our guests , because half of the princes were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who have come to attack us but to assist us .
in this moment I am collapsed .
these people were there , because they had courage and compassion and pre@@ judi@@ ced .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ atism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you connect to those who mean : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a mem@@ orandum of depth are working in a noble thinking factory , so an exception and not the rule are .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , fool you not . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am so usually how it is allowed .
if you look to Muslims around the world , and I did it with the greatest ever @-@ led study to Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity to the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m not an exception in any respect .
when people appear as an exception , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ler , is about to become a billi@@ on@@ shop .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats . it is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air pack@@ et is entered into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft presses in the Fra@@ c Centre in France had a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . a couple of years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting cables , high speed and acceleration achieve fast space .
they can also build self @-@ employed structures .
they learned to carry loads , to deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our aim is to exceed the limits of the possibility of the possibility of an autonomous flight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to realize an autonomous system , it must be collec@@ tively known to know where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at the ET@@ H Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic possibilities .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
every flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space , comp@@ ut@@ ations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest level eb@@ e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flying device , trying to beat two flies with one f@@ lap .
like other Star@@ r@@ hi@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , it is efficient in the down@@ ward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
unlike most of the star@@ ters , it can ho@@ ver , and has great advantages with start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind@@ b@@ ö@@ en .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight machine doesn &apos;t matter what the optimal position is reg@@ ained , and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often present fundamental abstract questions concerning the core of the matter .
such a question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for the controlled flight ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are also known as machines with a thousand mobile parts that sp@@ amm@@ un to inj@@ ure you .
decades ago , trained pilot @-@ controlled flying tools have been flying , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern th@@ ru@@ der .
we discovered that flies with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically @-@ sim@@ pl@@ est remote control unit . it was invented recently .
it only has a moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and cross @-@ rowing , no further actu@@ ators or controllers , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inside life happens very much , that it can fly stable , and move around in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern @-@ star@@ ters . to get it to flies , I have to throw it right .
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it right when you see all , is low , that &apos;s why I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in pleas@@ ur@@ gently , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in over@@ flow .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is not symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambitious in its alignment .
as a result , he receives the most excellent ability ,
to move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned or even like he rot@@ ates .
naturally it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some is imagin@@ able in models , the rest is lear@@ nt by flying .
let &apos;s see that .
if flying tools should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate twin @-@ prop@@ ellers flying presses .
these turns in clock@@ wise
and the others against the clock@@ wise .
when you build them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller comes from , electronics or battery -- can also fly to the machine if limited .
we will now demonstrate that by making a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration was investigated by synthetic swar@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables an aesthetic expression .
we did commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one disc bread -- and out@@ fit them with local technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where the room is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to reflect new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine at Broadway would like to be a flying lamp .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the wages in development and the creative act lies .
it serves as a memory , how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart tur@@ rets allowed to form it so spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , the dot is on the i .
thank you very much .
around 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes changed each other in a very far distant galaxy , they turned the mass of three son@@ es in a t@@ enth@@ s of pure energy .
for this short moment they light brigh@@ ter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy they were not released in the form of light .
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was left into space @-@ time plum@@ ge itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange the events at first .
a population of 1.3 billion years ago was evol@@ ving on earth .
since then , Earth has produced some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , dinosau@@ rs , people and -- God , even the Internet .
some 25 years ago , a group of particularly mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ -- Ra@@ i Weiss by MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver decided to build a huge laser detector to seek gra@@ vit@@ ational waves that are caused by col@@ li@@ zing black holes .
most kept them crazy .
but enough people recognized it as a mad geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ry Gra@@ vity @-@ Observ@@ atory .
in the following time , Lig@@ o &apos;s precision was significantly increased , which improved its recognition performance .
therefore , it is called Advanced Lig@@ o now .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run by some smaller , persistent problems .
on 14 September 2015 , just a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , crossing the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ zing black holes through the earth .
they went through you and me
and through the detector .
Scott Hughes : just two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell to my father &apos;s sick father .
basically , this was the fruits of my life .
all this , for what I had worked is not longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes , theoretical physi@@ cist on MIT . he has been exam@@ ining gravity waves of black holes and their observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ation wave is a sp@@ elling in the weight of space and time .
when tigh@@ tening the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in a direction and into the other .
to illustrate teaching lec@@ turers in courses for Rel@@ ativity Theory are often a really al@@ ber@@ y dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sty , stretching and du@@ sty . &quot;
the problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each one of us was stretched out and conf@@ essed with the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average human was 10 high -@@ 21 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . this year , the Lig@@ o employee declared to hell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be measured at less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of a atomic nucle@@ us . that is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text on gra@@ vit@@ ation
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of the L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves : &quot; the technical difficulties faced with such det@@ ectors are massive .
but physi@@ cist are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott appreci@@ ates , Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phones .
that &apos;s quite practical . because so you can create a picture or a map of things by taking care of several points forward light around you .
when killing is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
therefore , it is very difficult to make a picture of things , which means you particularly much :
about the face of your child .
instead , we l@@ ur@@ king according to certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close up the story behind .
&quot; now , just Alice &quot; speaks .
&quot; and Bob canc@@ ers her . &quot;
&quot; drummer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can no easy pictures of objects in space .
but as we respect changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least , Lig@@ o are the measured frequencies on the audi@@ ble range .
so if we convert wave pattern in sh@@ ale , we can hear the all literally .
the gravity of gravity can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time .
SH : two black , not swi@@ vel holes , cir@@ pen simple : w@@ up@@ p !
the two bodies rotate very fast , you can hear the same circul@@ ate with an additional sound . that sounds like that : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a type of motion @-@ set , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that may at least I never forget -- heard Lig@@ o : &#91; sur@@ ren@@ des sound &#93; No one that knows what he must listen to it as sound from -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ times sun mass that turn around as fast as the st@@ aff@@ s of your mixer .
AA : think about what this means .
two black holes , the dense body in all , one with a mass of 29 Son@@ nen , the other with a mass of 36 prob@@ es , surrounded by one hundred times per second , before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine this forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way to investigate the universe as they never had been possible before .
on this path , we can listen to all the sounds and the invisible .
so much in all we can -- practically or basically -- do not see .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mass@@ ager stars in super @-@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . of them we learned a lot about the space .
the exciting physical processes occur in the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon , and silicon .
we will never see because these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . the Ur@@ b@@ ang I would like to explore the first few minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the jungle is conce@@ aled through its own reflection .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back at the beginning .
and most import@@ antly , I am optim@@ istic that we have never seen in all things we &apos;ve never seen , which we have never seen and of which we have no idea . things we can only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o was in the first round of things we did not expect .
my colleague on MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o they watched , are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak the Sau@@ ces for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o enables us to view a completely different perspective on the events of all , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now exists , as bold as possible only possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great det@@ ectors and l@@ ur@@ king the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a very new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in all .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the jungle ?
now the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago , I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one year long , I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter whether it made me nervous , brought me in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
would I speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I be live in television ?
no , but yes !
wanted to start playing with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I was afraid , removed my fear .
my fear to keep talking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; my life has changed .
&quot; yes , &quot; I changed .
but there was a definite yes , that changed my life , on an un@@ expect@@ ant . it began with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the Klein@@ ste , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all the &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , &quot;
as a wa@@ it@@ ress , it would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; well , I need milk for my schn@@ apps . &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Ye@@ ah was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from then on , I always listened to play with them whenever you call me . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say Yes - every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has a stag@@ gering side effect : only recently , I really understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ S@@ agen came to play with my children my career .
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m an author . I think things are considering to live .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I am doing television , in large style .
in this TV @-@ season , I &apos;m responsible for making 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each program offers hundreds of jobs that existed before .
the budget for an episode of a television channel can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode , every nine days , four shows , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts , which are simultaneously in production , sometimes four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run on Thursday night .
over the world , my series runs in 256 places in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created and not only produced , so still not only . I must find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans about bon@@ fires and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who does it still ?
no one , therefore I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you with this .
I tell it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you , so that all of you who work so hard , whether you say a company , a land or a household , take me seriously when I say of work , so that I don &apos;t only live on the computer and f@@ anci@@ ere , and it &apos;s true , when I say : I understand that there is a dream job not about dreams .
it &apos;s all a job , everything work , all reality , all blood , sweat - no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
if I &apos;m in work properly , there is no other feeling .
my work is always creating a land out of nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , when I started troops , I painted on a canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a dream one has a high tone , deliver a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , clin@@ ically , and wor@@ rying , cruel and reasonable , cruel and sensible . and the best of it is the sum@@ s .
there is such a change in me when working is good .
a sum@@ s will begin in my head , and it grows and grows like a busy street , I could ride for you forever .
many people assume , when I tell them the sum@@ s that I am talking about writing that the letter is prepared to me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but that sum@@ s -- when I started working with TV production , when I started working and working together , build and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , you cannot asp@@ ire differently than size .
feel , not different to asp@@ ire than to reach size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or perhaps it is also a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it is genius .
perhaps it &apos;s called ego .
perhaps it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s .
I only want to say to you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to ask that .
to make one clear : the more successful I will be , the more rema@@ stered , the more crowded limits , the more work more at the same time , the more I write , the more I write story , all more expectations .
the more I work to be successful , the more I need to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , exagger@@ ated , over@@ run , over@@ run .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth , that their m@@ um is a single working institute .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son say : &quot; well , I want to go to Sh@@ onda Land . &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby titles .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum@@ s heard .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s didn &apos;t come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same thing as always : the same title work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan does not sleep , give up with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me , silence was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect titanium .
I was a preview @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I simply had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s was .
so what do you do when you do , the work that you love , suddenly f@@ ade ?
I know some might think : &quot; loc@@ ust you out , the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
but you know , you do it , you do , one likes to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother who knows just another and that gives the sum@@ s , when you know the sum@@ s , when the sum@@ s stopped , when the sum@@ s stops , who is then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart hears , can I survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern states &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress represents a question .
I am on the way out , late and she says : &quot; m@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say no more than to be aware of two things :
first , I must say Yes to all and second , she called me not &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
they don &apos;t call anyone &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
when did this happen ?
I spend it when I am Titan and my sum@@ s , and here everything changes before my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
we play and meet her sisters , we laugh a lot and I &apos;m reading quite dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the Sum@@ mens , can &apos;t do anything but to watch out .
I &apos;ve been focused .
I am quiet .
the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
everything that exists is sti@@ cky finger and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , tender voices , wat@@ ering sti@@ p@@ ens , and the song , in which it goes on , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; lets you get rid of .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe I breathe .
play is the opposite of works .
and I &apos;m happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
an mental door passes and an energy boost is coming in .
and that doesn &apos;t immediately happen , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it is quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now , I feel , I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something that we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the working environment , the Titan@@ ens@@ um@@ ms , that &apos;s only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , using programs and TV hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is no strength and it is non @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real sum is dependent on love .
the sum@@ s is the current one comes from the lifetime .
the real bu@@ zz is Self @-@ Consci@@ ousness and Peace .
the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of the history , which are to be experienced tasks , expec@@ tation and pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real sw@@ am is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ pered to me God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
once my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I do that as a rule , so I can release myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any debt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it was so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
play with me is not just as you work .
the truth is hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer at the workplace as home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , for what a man does better work as to be home ?
well yes , me .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too thin , none of them .
we are around in the garden , before and back , and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we cr@@ ush soap bubbles .
in doing so , I feel predominantly sti@@ ff , absent and confused .
I always att@@ ain to my mobile phone .
but it &apos;s okay .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe comp@@ lies me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why did we stop playing with the games ?
you can also say it ! always say Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you keep me nai@@ ve for a meeting .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and you also know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show character .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me , until they are coming up they want to do something else .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , I replaced Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and speak my teen@@ y daughter every 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are only 15 minutes , more needs it .
each can lift 15 minutes on a piece , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes on the piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no di@@ stra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the kids are ready to bed .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my welfare , my world . it must not be the children . it applies to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his soul peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with their own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
around the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
indul@@ ge in the 15 minutes !
find out what is doing well .
find out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I failed and I wins . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stand short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in the training when I wanted to do more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the piece , why not indul@@ ge in 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . the sum@@ s seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
work doesn &apos;t work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months opens a door , the energy is po@@ uring in and I find me in my office . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , she meets me and my soul . she guides me to new ideas . I use it into full outline and I love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
now that is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but only a part . and so I am so grateful .
it &apos;s be@@ es@@ u@@ ppe that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything on grip . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires burn still .
the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the country I shoot , the marathon , I run , the tro@@ users , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , lasting , naked and new life feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel at this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m an author . I think things happen , I wake up for life .
that belongs to the job that means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this jobs ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ ad@@ ful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke , or after a car accident .
for us , neuro@@ surgeon is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodies , has a very low capacity for self @-@ healing .
after severe injury of the central nervous system patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
this is probably the reason I was functional Neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve function through various surgical interventions .
certainly , they have heard of one of the best known ones , the &quot; low @-@ brain stim@@ ulation . &quot; it im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurological function improves .
it is truly an amazing technology . she has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s disease , which suffered severe pain and severe pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ cure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a leader and working day and night in the emergency .
often I provided patients with sk@@ ul@@ ls @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that brain @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a must touch the brain and increases the skull pressure .
to save life , one has to dimin@@ ish the skull pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a partially s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse using Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow the cells from this tissues .
this is not easy task .
to grow cells from a tissue @-@ piece , comparable to small children who are taken out of your families .
one must find the right diet , temperature , humidity , and environments in order to thri@@ ve it .
exactly that we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you can still know from the biology classes , that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small denom@@ ination of the brain .
it is surprising that this species from stem cells are obtained from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made a further fascinating observation : regular stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they were divided slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population which looked like stem cells but was different .
we needed to understand how they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ ar cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the state of the fo@@ etus they provide for the brain of the brain .
but why do they stay us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe they are taking part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
this is not so safe .
however , one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source , allowing the brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so , let &apos;s decide to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ language area and then the cells exactly so cul@@ tured as it did Jean @-@ François
and then , they have to be coloured far@@ med to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we re@@ planted them on the exception of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re@@ im@@ planted these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re@@ im@@ planted the same cells in a damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we re@@ im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were taken back after a few weeks , they would go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we placed an injury and re@@ im@@ planted exactly the same cells , and now the cells remained strong -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we em@@ bal@@ m in vitro , in the culture .
we could not stop here .
do these cells also help to rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate a brain injury ?
so we exercised monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets for one tablet .
they made them very well .
as they achieved a stable skill level , we last in the mot@@ ic Cort@@ ex mobile technology range .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand more .
just as it would happen to humans , it recovered spont@@ aneously to a certain degree , just like a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of pl@@ asti@@ ty brain mechanisms . they are re@@ covering to a certain degree as the ap@@ es .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left side you see the monkey , which re@@ covering spont@@ aneously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
well , see when we re@@ im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after irrit@@ ation .
I can tell you that were very exciting results for us too .
since that time , we have found very much more about these cells .
we can freeze it and then use them later .
we can use them in other neurop@@ ath@@ ology models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still , to im@@ pl@@ ore them with people .
I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives the means to heal herself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are , before you can start clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies .
BG : it is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team .
BG : looking into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission from the start of clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes to come to hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study using a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose patients to perform treatments and evaluate the treatments , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
afterwards one has to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
it is necessary to verify that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to look at them as of course .
we do not see democracy than the frag@@ ile plant which is in reality , but as inventory of our society .
we tend to look at them as un@@ changeable op@@ enness .
we believe capitalism inev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew made from Singapore and his large offspring in Beijing , doub@@ ted that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy over@@ comes with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I re@@ represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was in@@ comprehen@@ sible to me that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there could be no better jus@@ tification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my eager friends who told me that the democracy would be abol@@ ished when they would change anything .
at this point , I would like to introduce you a economic model for a real democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I beg you , along with me again , that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake believe we could save democracy , but that we need a tru@@ sting and def@@ en@@ ical democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for without democracy our companies are lev@@ elled , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted .
on the topic of waste , I want to point you to an interesting contra@@ diction , which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
I call it the &quot; Twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . they know and recognize him as the debt of debt , which throws a long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt dispute ,
but only few recognize his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is to be anxi@@ ous to invest there , however , to invest there , where it would be productive and income from where you could carry out the debt crisis and also all the things that humanity is ur@@ gently needed , for example , &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and the euro@@ zone , 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial facilities , machinery , office buildings , schools , streets , g@@ inger@@ bread , equipment , and so on and so on .
3.4 trillion U.S. dollar sounds like a lot of money until it compar@@ es with the 5,1 billion US dollars that are around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock ex@@ changes , and the real estate prices .
so debts and un@@ productive capital make the twins summit , which do not explo@@ it by the usual market mechanisms .
the result are stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe , and therefore a low demand that would carry on the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m that could not invest in which they would not invest , that his son would kill him if he is growing ,
un@@ wanted circumstances , that leads to circumstances that kills it kills him .
that is my Ha@@ des with capitalism --
its most elabor@@ ate art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to further enhance our lives , developing human talents , and especially to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
I think so . but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ eles defined democracy than board form , in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
of course the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has , of course , too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be an error to dimin@@ ish the priority of ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these fail@@ ings .
the decisive thing of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they abandoned the working arms , but was not just the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive that they had the right to political participation with the same voice balance in questions of the state cran@@ ks@@ ha@@ fts .
although ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not held a long time --
like a candle that lights very bright , it is also burned quickly .
however , our liberal democra@@ cies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , who ultimately became a stat@@ ute for ruling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was incorporated into politics while the economy -- the world of corporations -- a democratic zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in our present democra@@ cies , since the time that this split between politics and economy began to under@@ go an in@@ ex@@ orable battle between the two and the economy gradually mig@@ rated to politics .
are you wonder@@ ing why the politicians are no longer like that ?
it is not based on a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is obvious that it can be in the government nowadays , and yet not in power , because power is w@@ asted by politics in the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my Ha@@ des with capitalism .
if you think about it , it &apos;s like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that are so sustainable the animals , of which she feeds , has dec@@ im@@ ated , that she is star@@ ved at the end .
it is similar to the economy that politics falls so far , that it grows through the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of corporations will grow , political goods are increasing , the ine@@ quality is rising and the management of corporations have become frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; exp@@ els from democracy , the higher will the twins summit , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and well@@ being of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must bring together the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keep control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist left hand had this idea 100 years ago and it did not happen very well .
the teaching from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms will only recover its position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : to abol@@ ish the working arms !
capitalism does it , replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robot .
the problem is , so long economy and politics are separated , the automation of the twins is higher , the waste of waste , and the social conflicts deeper , as it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must uni@@ fy the economy and to unite the areas of business and politics , and make sure that we were able to democra@@ tised the re@@ united area , otherwise we can appear in a disease @-@ raising hyper@@ auto@@ cra@@ tic , which lets the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the question is not whether capitalism has caused the technical achievements he will survive .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is similar to a D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that of the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; or rather resem@@ bling the people of the universe and into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &apos; , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &apos; , in long conversations with the sense of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like to look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ such Utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I want to give you , in all soon , some examples .
in the company of companies , please make a capital market in which you will earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from a working place to the next , and the company -- no matter which one currently works -- is the property of those who work currently in the company .
all income from capital and revenues , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the company , who do not work therein , and employees working there , but the company does not belong . no diving more between capital and labour , no major g@@ aps between investment and sp@@ ar , and ultimately no emp@@ oral twin summit .
in the area of global political economy : please imagine that our national currencies had a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging economies &#93; in the interest of all mankind .
in fact , imagine that the entire world trade is acted in this currency -- call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum of the country &apos;s trade deficit or the trading surplus of the country , into a common fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment means are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was , that at that time , it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have them , especially in front of the background a re@@ united politics and economy .
the world , which I describe you , is simultaneously liber@@ ally preferred , in whom they prefer privileged people , and Marx@@ ist , because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash of history , and Key@@ nesi@@ an , global Key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or are we checked in a &quot; Matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide on politically .
it is in our hands , and we do better democra@@ tically .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ ally Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and the economy is ... Do not doing it , the technological development will generate such a massive decline in total economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis from a part of Earth to the next one , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our democra@@ cies , but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is accurate , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , for this reason I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ist , and how Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely un@@ ra@@ vel .
BG : actually , and now we are there .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG said : this is a very Greek , a sort of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein , who told her . BG said : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have said clearly what you keep coming from the perspective of the West in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a big measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democra@@ cies we have the note of a democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy on politics during the area where most of the most plays , -- the area of business -- a completely democratic zone .
in certain ways , when I may say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism to democracy -- that is a mistake , historically .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stuart Mill --
he was very skep@@ tical about what concerns the democratic development .
what can be observed now in China , resem@@ bles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now throwing to what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells amazing to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experience as finance ministers from the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I imag@@ ined that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , of personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to make the Eurozone a new beginning ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely about the compl@@ ac@@ ency of saying goodbye and the continuing den@@ ial that a massive deteri@@ oration line went through the euro@@ zone , and continue to be threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal to deny this den@@ ial --
unfortunately , the forces within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continues to deny the den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries to maintain a economic system , which is not viable , will not be able to obtain a while due to political will and auth@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and dis@@ rup@@ tive .
BG : which change is you ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone doesn &apos;t have a future when we do not change its construction .
BG : did you have any mistakes in your time finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ est ...
if there is an Minister for Finance , or any minister , who , after 6 months in office , especially in such an inv@@ oked situation , claimed that he did not have any mistakes , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake had to sign the motion for extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in pages of the investors , to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they only wanted to bring only our government , only because they did not want to deal with the disp@@ enses that were engaged in the euro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the Tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy , said : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal@@ ine mistake . &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive speech of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is opposite to somebody who lives and love Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the Eurozone won &apos;t survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if they did not survive , the acquitted of cent@@ rifu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ically and to destroy the European Union .
it will not have disast@@ rous consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we take on the way to a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will be well toler@@ ated for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope you will be wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you very much for taking T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although he is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company of Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an icon and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Films , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and the content that will produce Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard fought industry .
there are so many TV series , that Roy can &apos;t choose any .
he must find shows which are very , very well .
in other words , he has to find shows that are located on the right at this bend .
this curve is the distribution distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows receive this rating .
will be given your show with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you got a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that make addic@@ tive , where , after someone has looked at a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows such as &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- it should be enough to tell you what &apos;s going on at the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price does not take care of the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he makes himself more thoughts about the middle occupancy , the average television -- the shows which are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t am@@ aze .
so he must ensure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something , that &apos;s why Roy Price does not take anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he stops a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and introduces them online where they can watch everyone free of charge .
and if you get out of Amazon for nothing , you &apos;re going to be correct , right ?
millions of spectators watching these episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are watched at watching this shows .
you are being watched by Roy and his team that would like to record everything .
you capture when you start the show when you p@@ aus@@ ed , which parts you ski@@ pped or check again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process the data and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make Sit@@ com more than four republi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show , because it was not so good .
it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- so something about the average , but not just what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time at another company has pl@@ az@@ ed a top show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he does something different .
instead of organized a competition , he and his team have looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x spectators , i.e. the reviews that give them the shows whose course shows it etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had gathered all the pieces , they went into a venture and decided not to make a Sit@@ com above four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this Show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has made a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; receives a 9.1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course the question is : what is happening here ?
one has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data diversi@@ fied firms .
they combine these many data and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
why is that ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision that you meet , then you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimised by a very powerful computer .
the worst thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis is not working , this is a bit sc@@ ary , because we are living in a time we are going to make more and more statistics in order to make serious decisions more than television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes to touch with this software . come in contact , you are in prison .
if anyone is in prison in the USA and asking for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al takes place or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
medi@@ oc@@ re TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . it is not that a company does not know how multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
the data se@@ est companies are sometimes wrong .
yes , even Google makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it was done by data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the worse way -- by data analysis of the Google Research .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news station . success culmin@@ ated in a release in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked just fine , year around year until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the withdrawal of publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
even the data sealed companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these mistakes , data is going to be in decisions of life -- on the workplace , in case of legal en@@ forcement , in medicine .
so , we should rather make sure data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some samples above the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and non @-@ successful decisions . this design should be widespread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you can mainly do two things :
when replacing this problem in its components , so that you can analyse the components ; as a second , you put the items together again to hold a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to gr@@ asp the parts again , and then come to a decision .
there is another tool , and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces put together again , even if the information is in@@ complete to write a good decision -- especially when it &apos;s the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and understanding where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , what else they would not have been able to put together . but the decision , how to take all of these parts , put together again and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that did not stand in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they went a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way .
they used to control all their decisions , first as they w@@ ager to TV ideas when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a safe decision because they always could say : &quot; they say the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , dates are just one tool , and to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the tool for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions with a Ja@@ - or No @-@ question you only need to shake the ball in order to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- exactly here in this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ll find it later with a demo demo .
so far I met some decisions in my life , in which I should have listened to the ball .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated than data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
this is perhaps the ball wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is possible to make decisions at the end of the curve , if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I received this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still paid out , decisions to meet , an expert in what you do , and risks involved .
by the end , it is not the data , but the risks , with which you are landing at the right end of the curve .
thank you beautiful .
