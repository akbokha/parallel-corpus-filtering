<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You may know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book written in which he was spectacular that the NSA did illegal telephones from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">Therein, he describes a catastrophic US secret service, in which the CIA had literally surpassed its designs for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know whom the chapter did not feel right?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government was determined against Risen and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol for the patterns of the government, whistleblowers, and to swirling journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right, if media do not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the mute, they offer.</seg>
<seg id="14">So, when the government dropped anchor in Risen, he did something that many brave reporters did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen was living with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they were for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can always be defeated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and irritability to make statements, this could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his permission, secretly married his telephone calls,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail information, financial and banking information, its lending information, and even travel tips with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information they found evidence that used them to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-wleblowers and risk of thought to condemn.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too busy as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about National Security was the result of having a whistleblower came to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus, we use the press coverage of the game, which should be protected by the first constitutional law, because the government has more possibilities to spelling all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology of the government allowed to handle reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can contact them from the moment they contact, rather than in the aftermath.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that had not existed when Risen had written his book, and it is considerably more secure than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is SecureDrop, an open source-crossing system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the website of Aaron swarms, which was developed by us today from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, such as the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can also instantly upload or send documents, like any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and saved on a server, to which only the specific news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot provide any more information in secret, and many of the information they would like would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole, to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are always developing new spy technologies that are all vulnerable to us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is to ensure that not only technology denominers like Edward Snowden have a possibility to kill abuse. it is just as important that we can protect the next whistleblowers,</seg>
<seg id="39">The over abuse during the supply of soldiers must be modest and reported by overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker, the alarm to contaminated water from Flint. or a Wallenstein-Insider, who warns us in front of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies have not only been made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the largest data back of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that Reiche and Might] have been hidden in tax havens.] [we begged Robert Palmer by Global Witness to a statement.] This week we were greeted by news about a leak of 11 million documents in Panama's based law firm Mosbag Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mosbag Fonseca go and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that?"</seg>
<seg id="45">In fact, we actually see e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This already has its first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has stepped down.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also, there are reports that a ban on the brutal Syrian dictator of Bashar al-Assad's postwar companies in tax havens has.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin is leading to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others that wait nervously to the next release, and to the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weeps away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, streets.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens will be used by some very few, to hide and effet their assets -- something that we are discussing and unveil them for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people read this whole world very confusing, and it is hard to understand how this tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So, one company in another company, in another company, in another company that makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably, because there were no prominent Americans in these revelations that occurred in this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle, after which these tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a datleck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some US states need fewer information, less information is required to set up a company than to obtain a library ID.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of transparency in the United States allowed the employees of school districts, subject to school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has been allowed to zoom out especially vulnerable investor.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a hidden investigators into the offices of 13 Lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigations gave himself as African ministers who wanted to bring suspects money into the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that everyone could make suggestions for a lawyer, how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all pre-prefers. none of these lawyers participated as clients, and of course no one has handed over money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who spread out our hidden investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not a single leader, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It's about how the system works, established through corruption, tax evasion, poverty, and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very different, as if we could do nothing against it, as if nothing has changed; as if it is always the rich and wealthy.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a newborn optimist I see that there has been quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years we have seen incident to more transparency, regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been captured in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US came down here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill into two parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as an agent in order to ensure more transparency in the United States and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us with Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are mad if they see how other people can hide their real identity behind hypocrites.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the business which stand up and say:" "" "intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end the laws of this kind of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end the Intransparency, who now allow this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">A day after I completed my design studies, I made a rear sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in the red Mazda stayed and looked up my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. after that, he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him," "" "Where are you sleeping tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans that. I don't want to get kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me:" "" "I have a airbed. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said, "Go, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I lay in bed, I stared on the ceiling, and thought, "Oh man! what happened to me there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild beast sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, tipped on toe peaks at the door, and my bedroom door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he bought from me is today in his classroom. he is teacher now.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as hosts. it has changed my viewing angle completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">"" "" "" "maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood, actually friends who were waiting for it to be discovered?" ""</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my airbags, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let us take a leap forward, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommates, and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it, be afraid to transform.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment will stay at a designer bed bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk inclusive, with a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created such "Airports and Breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast "[AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep at a wooden floor for 20 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="131">They thought it was great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham-omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all over the city. when we passed our last guest and passed the door to the castle, Brian and I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that at the same time we find new friends and could pay for rent our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former fellow worker, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented ourselves to investors: "we want to create a website, looking to public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms, whose doors are closing, when visiting us.</seg>
<seg id="139">On the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still in consolation would be investing in a business, allowed a stranger to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned, as children, strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When you have a problem, you are thinking about things that can be good. we could designer.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Art we learned that design is much more than just a look and haptic -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create under design immense confidence, between people who never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I want to give you a sample, which degree we embalm.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up, if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I want to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked cell phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet suit of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is still personal as your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So the most guests feel when they sleep elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who now has Al Gores Mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell us on Twitter that it dictates to the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced what kind of trust we want to build on. I want to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first presented with his name; if he would have told what he comes, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine that you would have 150 assessments, all of them say: "he can really hold fast cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well-thought feedback system strengthens trust significantly.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning, we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard to give people negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest were given their assessments before we presented them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people rely on each other, depending on how they are dealing with age and place.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people most, who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social default.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting if you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three beats, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation is out of similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you are priced.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">When you tell too little, like "Hi!," you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">One tells too much, as for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is also not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "Great artwork in your apartment! I'm making holidays with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design, making this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With which we had not reckoned, the great amount of people who were more than willing to deposit these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">Firstly: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need, which had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, business is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times, if not all goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who are unallowed to celebrated parties or apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly on my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront front, when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts if I think only remember.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the caller, was, and will always be our biggest motivation to improve us further.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only one fraction had a problem of the 123 million nights.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people confided to each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, you can create wondrous works.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made vacation in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who are inclined because of sitting activities on heart attacks.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angel who save lives, even though they don't know a right hand.</seg>
<seg id="218">They drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay one even longer without calculating extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, of course not every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">For the first time I stumbled about this concept, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of the part with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here a economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it just is simply "tending industry" to call it, the thing is not fair.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">Humans put a part of itself open, and this changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel nowadays, this is to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would, however, if traveling is a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at each place you visit, a group would be waiting to fill a group there, fill a thoroughly and show in a bar-pentour neighborhood, one of which one has never heard.</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you want to cook from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to privacy rights.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to make apartments for sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thought of shared share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I introduce cities which allow us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and amortisation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea, Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces which belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">They were mediated to people whose children were moved out. they were incubator programs,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the Share economy alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be able to host a stranger or even host in 191 countries.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be so crazy, as it was taught.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality also gave it before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep root prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I like it astonishing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda passes to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, design does not solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had these great influence, I wonder what we can use design shortly.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brains underwear, a terrorist act?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study concluded that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans think that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met Muslims as well: it is great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I'm a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A sealant fitness fanatics,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to oun me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexual men, as some of my friends, but as the Muslim. I decided to bear the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist bid for me, and on the pressure that I felt like 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not just accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, asked, doubted, and finally believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and lonely dedication that deepened with each reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm is sometimes bringing me to weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone you perceive, you fully understand, and yet in love?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later, I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as engineering.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived basically the "Egyptian-American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had at the end of a piece, looked at the screen and saw the word "breaking News."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people split from buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned rapidly into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">""... "I switched to the TV channel and heard:" ""... "Muslim terrorists..." ""... "... in the name of Islam..." ""... "Jihad..." ""... "" ""... "" ""</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu transformed me the deeds of others of a civil war into a suspect.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to drive through the Middle East of the United States to move into a new city and begin working with the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I am silent -- as we were silent -- so deep it went to my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as the Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We went to our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that discussed: "be vigilant," "Seid cautious," "lead in well lit areas," "Don't be ashamed."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day, where Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">And once again the warnings: "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unilted and I heard from attacks on Muslims or people who kept for Muslims, free and struck.</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really brandangling on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt really good.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have ventured the rage of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain itself continually.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations, which are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually say people: "there is a problem in that country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want Muslims to ban Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">It just raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and benign tumour only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the United States, but an important organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, Ersthelfer and Paralympics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make a safer place?</seg>
<seg id="331">It may be a few parking frey-old, but not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visiting of a mosque leads to consider people of other faith tolerant, and show larger civil participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not being radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radialised in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radicalization process, it is determined that it will start online. as a result, the person is cut off from their church, so that the person believes that the extreme group believes the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology, is a traitor or from faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we need to stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS remains its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to us into their precursor, if you acknowledge them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology in their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But if one throws a look at them, they don't drive them what they read in their "Holy Scriptures."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam has recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because she meets the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said that the problem was just the opposite. every clergy, with whom she had spoken, brought her to silence, and said that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing, and that of their anger was given, it was a major goal for the instrumentalisation of extremists who were talking a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This beam asked the connection to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accuse her for her anger, he demonstrated her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept trying to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight, like the Islamophobia and my family concerned.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientist studies -- demonstrate: if we fear ourselves, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept a authoritarian government system, conformity, and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: when you report test subjects, in which negative about Muslims were reported, they are rather military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">When you look at the mood against Muslims - between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the advance of the war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to the Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to increase the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear shes us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">For the assignment of collectivism, it is not only about to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person he knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was startled and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when should I become such a sealed young man from my opinion?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne at her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as if he had posted utterances against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot at Deah for eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism cannot only be immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discuss it and for us it was not easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave our children: one that would be able to control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we drove silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and went out my shoes, and went into the building hall, and what I saw, left me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then, Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the princes were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who have come to attack us but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In this moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there, because they had courage and compassion and prejudiced.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanatism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to those who mean: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are a TEDTalk, a memorandum of depth are working in a noble thinking factory, so an exception and not the rule are.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, fool you not. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am so usually how it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look to Muslims around the world, and I did it with the greatest ever-led study to Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity to the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm not an exception in any respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people appear as an exception, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Bastler, is about to become a billionshop.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats. it is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air packet is entered into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft presses in the Frac Centre in France had a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. a couple of years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting cables, high speed and acceleration achieve fast space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-employed structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They learned to carry loads, to deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">"" "" "" "our aim is to exceed the limits of the possibility of the possibility of an autonomous flight." ""</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to realize an autonomous system, it must be collectively known to know where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Every flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space, computations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available on the highest level ebe. g." "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying device, trying to beat two flies with one flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starrhigglers, it is efficient in the downward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most of the starters, it can hover, and has great advantages with start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as windböen.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight machine doesn't matter what the optimal position is regained, and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often present fundamental abstract questions concerning the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for the controlled flight?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are also known as machines with a thousand mobile parts that spammun to injure you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilot-controlled flying tools have been flying, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern thruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flies with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically-simplest remote control unit. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and cross-rowing, no further actuators or controllers, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the inside life happens very much, that it can fly stable, and move around in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern-starters. to get it to flies, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of throwing it right when you see all, is low, that's why I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the monospinner is an exercise in pleasurgently, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is not symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambitious in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the most excellent ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">To move in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is turned or even like he rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Naturally it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is imaginable in models, the rest is learnt by flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flying tools should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate twin-propellers flying presses.</seg>
<seg id="453">These turns in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the others against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller comes from, electronics or battery -- can also fly to the machine if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by making a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration was investigated by synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables an aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We did commercial micro-quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one disc bread -- and outfit them with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where the room is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you motivate these demonstrations to reflect new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine at Broadway would like to be a flying lamp.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the wages in development and the creative act lies.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart turrets allowed to form it so spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, the dot is on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">Around 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes changed each other in a very far distant galaxy, they turned the mass of three sones in a tenths of pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they light brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy they were not released in the form of light.</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was left into space-time plumge itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events at first.</seg>
<seg id="476">A population of 1.3 billion years ago was evolving on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, Earth has produced some things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God, even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">Some 25 years ago, a group of particularly mujahed-- Rai Weiss by MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever decided to build a huge laser detector to seek gravitational waves that are caused by collizing black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most kept them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized it as a mad geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the Detector Ligo: the Laser Interferometry Gravity-Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following time, Ligo's precision was significantly increased, which improved its recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, it is called Advanced Ligo now.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run by some smaller, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, just a few days after the start-up of the detector, crossing the gravitational waves of the two collizing black holes through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: just two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my father's sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, this was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, for what I had worked is not longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on MIT. he has been examining gravity waves of black holes and their observatories like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitation wave is a spelling in the weight of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When tightening the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in a direction and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate teaching lecturers in courses for Relativity Theory are often a really albery dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusty, stretching and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each one of us was stretched out and confessed with the waves. the elongation of an average human was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">"" "this means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. this year, the Ligo employee declared to hell." ""</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be measured at less than a thousandth of the radius of a atomic nucleus. that is grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text on gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of the LIGOs, the hunt for the waves: "the technical difficulties faced with such detectors are massive.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicist are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott appreciates, Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">That's quite practical. because so you can create a picture or a map of things by taking care of several points forward light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">When killing is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore, it is very difficult to make a picture of things, which means you particularly much:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we lurking according to certain characteristics such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close up the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just Alice" speaks.</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob cancers her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"drummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can no easy pictures of objects in space.</seg>
<seg id="519">But as we respect changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least, Ligo are the measured frequencies on the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave pattern in shale, we can hear the all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity of gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not swivel holes, cirpen simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">The two bodies rotate very fast, you can hear the same circulate with an additional sound. that sounds like that: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a type of motion-set, shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that may at least I never forget -- heard Ligo: [surrendes sound] No one that knows what he must listen to it as sound from -- SH:... two black holes with 30-times sun mass that turn around as fast as the staffs of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dense body in all, one with a mass of 29 Sonnen, the other with a mass of 36 probes, surrounded by one hundred times per second, before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine this forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a whole new way to investigate the universe as they never had been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path, we can listen to all the sounds and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">So much in all we can -- practically or basically -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massager stars in super-novae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we learned a lot about the space.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes occur in the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon, and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron, as if it would be transparent glass. the Urbang I would like to explore the first few minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the jungle is concealed through its own reflection.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves it should be possible to look back at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly, I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things we've never seen, which we have never seen and of which we have no idea. things we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo was in the first round of things we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague on MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo they watched, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak the Sauces for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo enables us to view a completely different perspective on the events of all, to the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now exists, as bold as possible only possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great detectors and lurking the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a very new generation of observatories on Earth and in all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the jungle?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago, I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "one year long, I would say" "" "Yes!" "" "before I was afraid." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether it made me nervous, brought me in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Would I speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I be live in television?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, wovor I was afraid, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep talking, my social fear -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," I changed.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes, that changed my life, on an unexpectant. it began with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the Kleinste, calls for inexplicable reasons all the "kittens,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As a waitress, it would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"well, I need milk for my schnapps."</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the jump. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yeah was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from then on, I always listened to play with them whenever you call me. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say Yes - every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a staggering side effect: only recently, I really understood that the "Yes" -Sagen came to play with my children my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I'm an author. I think things are considering to live.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I am doing television, in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season, I'm responsible for making 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each program offers hundreds of jobs that existed before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television channel can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode, every nine days, four shows, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts, which are simultaneously in production, sometimes four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">Over the world, my series runs in 256 places in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created and not only produced, so still not only. I must find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans about bonfires and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who does it still?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I tell it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you, so that all of you who work so hard, whether you say a company, a land or a household, take me seriously when I say of work, so that I don't only live on the computer and fanciere, and it's true, when I say: I understand that there is a dream job not about dreams.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, everything work, all reality, all blood, sweat - no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">If I'm in work properly, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work is always creating a land out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"" "" "" "it is, when I started troops, I painted on a canvas." ""</seg>
<seg id="608">As a dream one has a high tone, deliver a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicating, clinically, and worrying, cruel and reasonable, cruel and sensible. and the best of it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working is good.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums will begin in my head, and it grows and grows like a busy street, I could ride for you forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume, when I tell them the sums that I am talking about writing that the letter is prepared to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But that sums -- when I started working with TV production, when I started working and working together, build and work together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, you cannot aspire differently than size.</seg>
<seg id="623">Feel, not different to aspire than to reach size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it is also a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it's called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it's the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I only want to say to you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to ask that.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one clear: the more successful I will be, the more remastered, the more crowded limits, the more work more at the same time, the more I write, the more I write story, all more expectations.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I need to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, exaggerated, overrun, overrun.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth, that their mum is a single working institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson say: "well, I want to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titles.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums didn't come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same thing as always: the same title work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a Titan does not sleep, give up with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me, silence was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect titanium.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a preview-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I simply had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do when you do, the work that you love, suddenly fade?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know some might think: "locust you out, the author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do it, you do, one likes to be a teacher, a banker, a mother who knows just another and that gives the sums, when you know the sums, when the sums stopped, when the sums stops, who is then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart hears, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states" waitress represents a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">I am on the way out, late and she says: "mum, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say no more than to be aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say Yes to all and second, she called me not "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="675">They don't call anyone "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I spend it when I am Titan and my sums, and here everything changes before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mama, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and meet her sisters, we laugh a lot and I'm reading quite dramatic from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in the absence of the Summens, can't do anything but to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I've been focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists is sticky finger and humid kisses, tender voices, watering stipens, and the song, in which it goes on, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen" lets you get rid of.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I'm happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">An mental door passes and an energy boost is coming in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't immediately happen, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it is quiet, barely audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now, I feel, I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working environment, the Titanensumms, that's only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, using programs and TV hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no strength and it is non-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sum is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the current one comes from the lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is Self-Consciousness and Peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignores the pressure of the history, which are to be experienced tasks, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real swam is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered to me God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do that as a rule, so I can release myself as a workaholic of any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it was so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play with me is not just as you work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer at the workplace as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, for what a man does better work as to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well yes, me.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too thin, none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We are around in the garden, before and back, and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We do small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crush soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">In doing so, I feel predominantly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always attain to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it's okay.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe complies me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why did we stop playing with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! always say Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep me naive for a meeting.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you also know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show character.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me, until they are coming up they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, I replaced Marienkäfer or biscuit.</seg>
<seg id="750">"" "and speak my teeny daughter every 15 minutes with me, I am mother of the year." ""</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more needs it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Each can lift 15 minutes on a piece, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the kids are ready to bed.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my welfare, my world. it must not be the children. it applies to feel the sums to have a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with their own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Indulge in the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what is doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I failed and I wins. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "stand short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in the training when I wanted to do more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece, why not indulge in 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months opens a door, the energy is pouring in and I find me in my office. I hear an unknown melody, she meets me and my soul. she guides me to new ideas. I use it into full outline and I love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums, the sums is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">Now that is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but only a part. and so I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's beesuppe that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a Titan, who plays a trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything on grip. my brain is still working. my bonfires burn still.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country I shoot, the marathon, I run, the trousers, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more makes this unusual, lasting, naked and new life feeling in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel at this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I'm an author. I think things happen, I wake up for life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job that means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this jobs,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreadful.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "to be less work and more games." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke, or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us, neurosurgeon is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodies, has a very low capacity for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After severe injury of the central nervous system patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason I was functional Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve function through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly, they have heard of one of the best known ones, the "low-brain stimulation." it implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. she has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, which suffered severe pain and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean neuro-cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a leader and working day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skulls-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that brain-brain traumata must touch the brain and increases the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, one has to diminish the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a partially swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse using Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow the cells from this tissues.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from a tissue-piece, comparable to small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">One must find the right diet, temperature, humidity, and environments in order to thrive it.</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly that we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you can still know from the biology classes, that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small denomination of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising that this species from stem cells are obtained from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: regular stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were divided slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population which looked like stem cells but was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed to understand how they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebellar cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the state of the foetus they provide for the brain of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe they are taking part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">This is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">However, one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source, allowing the brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, let's decide to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-language area and then the cells exactly so cultured as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And then, they have to be coloured farmed to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we replanted them on the exception of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we reimplanted these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimplanted the same cells in a damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were taken back after a few weeks, they would go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we placed an injury and reimplanted exactly the same cells, and now the cells remained strong -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells we embalm in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help to recuperate a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we exercised monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets for one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">As they achieved a stable skill level, we last in the motic Cortex mobile technology range.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to humans, it recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just like a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastity brain mechanisms. they are recovering to a certain degree as the apes.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side you see the monkey, which recovering spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Well, see when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after irritation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were very exciting results for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found very much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and then use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathology models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still, to implore them with people.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives the means to heal herself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are, before you can start clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: it is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: looking into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission from the start of clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes to come to hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study using a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose patients to perform treatments and evaluate the treatments, whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Afterwards one has to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">It is necessary to verify that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to look at them as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy than the fragile plant which is in reality, but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as unchangeable openness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew made from Singapore and his large offspring in Beijing, doubted that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy overcomes with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I rerepresented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was incomprehensible to me that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my eager friends who told me that the democracy would be abolished when they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to introduce you a economic model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"" "" "" "I beg you, along with me again, that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup of a mistake believe we could save democracy, but that we need a trusting and defenical democracy." ""</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our companies are levelled, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic of waste, I want to point you to an interesting contradiction, which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "Twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. they know and recognize him as the debt of debt, which throws a long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt dispute,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only few recognize his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is to be anxious to invest there, however, to invest there, where it would be productive and income from where you could carry out the debt crisis and also all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example, "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and the eurozone, 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial facilities, machinery, office buildings, schools, streets, gingerbread, equipment, and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion U.S. dollar sounds like a lot of money until it compares with the 5,1 billion US dollars that are around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchanges, and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">So debts and unproductive capital make the twins summit, which do not exploit by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe, and therefore a low demand that would carry on the pessimism that could not invest in which they would not invest, that his son would kill him if he is growing,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unwanted circumstances, that leads to circumstances that kills it kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my Hades with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its most elaborate art. all the unproductive capital should be used to further enhance our lives, developing human talents, and especially to finance the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think so. but before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy than board form, in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course the Athenian democracy has, of course, too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error to diminish the priority of athenian democracy due to these failings.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing of the athenian democracy was and is that they abandoned the working arms, but was not just the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive that they had the right to political participation with the same voice balance in questions of the state crankshafts.</seg>
<seg id="935">Although athenian democracy has not held a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that lights very bright, it is also burned quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, who ultimately became a statute for ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">"" "for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was incorporated into politics while the economy -- the world of corporations -- a democratic zone." ""</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the time that this split between politics and economy began to undergo an inexorable battle between the two and the economy gradually migrated to politics.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are no longer like that?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not based on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is obvious that it can be in the government nowadays, and yet not in power, because power is wasted by politics in the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my Hades with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it's like a herd of predators that are so sustainable the animals, of which she feeds, has decimated, that she is starved at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that politics falls so far, that it grows through the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of corporations will grow, political goods are increasing, the inequality is rising and the management of corporations have become frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism the "demos" [the people] expels from democracy, the higher will the twins summit, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and wellbeing of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must bring together the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keep control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left hand had this idea 100 years ago and it did not happen very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms will only recover its position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it, replacing low-wage workers through automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long economy and politics are separated, the automation of the twins is higher, the waste of waste, and the social conflicts deeper, as it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "we must unify the economy and to unite the areas of business and politics, and make sure that we were able to democratised the reunited area, otherwise we can appear in a disease-raising hyperautocratic, which lets the film" "" "Matrix" "" "as a documentary." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism has caused the technical achievements he will survive.</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is similar to a Dystopia, similar to that of the society in "Star Trek," or rather resembling the people of the universe and into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians', or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians', in long conversations with the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to look like this "Star Trek" -such Utopia instead of the "Matrix" -similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I want to give you, in all soon, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the company of companies, please make a capital market in which you will earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from a working place to the next, and the company -- no matter which one currently works -- is the property of those who work currently in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">All income from capital and revenues, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company, who do not work therein, and employees working there, but the company does not belong. no diving more between capital and labour, no major gaps between investment and spar, and ultimately no emporal twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy: please imagine that our national currencies had a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging economies] in the interest of all mankind.</seg>
<seg id="966">In fact, imagine that the entire world trade is acted in this currency -- call it "the cosmos," in units of "Kosmos" -- and every government pays the sum of the country's trade deficit or the trading surplus of the country, into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment means are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was, that at that time, it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, especially in front of the background a reunited politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world, which I describe you, is simultaneously liberally preferred, in whom they prefer privileged people, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we checked in a "Matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide on politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a liberally Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and the economy is... Do not doing it, the technological development will generate such a massive decline in total economic demand, which Larry Summers is called "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis from a part of Earth to the next one, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is accurate, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, for this reason I am a libertarian Marxist, and how Keynes, and therefore I am completely unravel.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are there.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG said: this is a very Greek, a sort of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein, who told her. BG said: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have said clearly what you keep coming from the perspective of the West in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a big measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the note of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my talk, we have limited democracy on politics during the area where most of the most plays, -- the area of business -- a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In certain ways, when I may say that provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to link liberalism to democracy -- that is a mistake, historically.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was very skeptical about what concerns the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed now in China, resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now throwing to what the West has done in the 19th century, smells amazing to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as finance ministers from the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I imagined that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, of personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make the Eurozone a new beginning,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely about the complacency of saying goodbye and the continuing denial that a massive deterioration line went through the eurozone, and continue to be threatened by the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal to deny this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Unfortunately, the forces within the eurozone, within the European group, continues to deny the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to maintain a economic system, which is not viable, will not be able to obtain a while due to political will and authitarianism, but if the change occurs, it happens abruptly and disruptive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: which change is you ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone doesn't have a future when we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you have any mistakes in your time finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernest...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is an Minister for Finance, or any minister, who, after 6 months in office, especially in such an invoked situation, claimed that he did not have any mistakes, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake had to sign the motion for extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in pages of the investors, to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to bring only our government, only because they did not want to deal with the dispenses that were engaged in the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they had been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the Troika, who imposed this policy, said: "this was a colossaline mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive speech of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is opposite to somebody who lives and love Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "" "" "my greatest fear is that the Eurozone won't survive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they did not survive, the acquitted of centrifugal forces will be demonically and to destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">It will not have disastrous consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"" "" "" "if we take on the way to a post-modern 1930, what it appears to me, it will be well tolerated for the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you will be wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you very much for taking TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although he is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an icon and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "Films, TV, Technology, Tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and the content that will produce Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series, that Roy can't choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows which are very, very well.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are located on the right at this bend.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the distribution distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows receive this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Will be given your show with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you got a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that make addictive, where, after someone has looked at a season, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows such as "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- it should be enough to tell you what's going on at the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price does not take care of the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes himself more thoughts about the middle occupancy, the average television -- the shows which are neither good nor bad, they simply don't amaze.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something, that's why Roy Price does not take anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he stops a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and introduces them online where they can watch everyone free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if you get out of Amazon for nothing, you're going to be correct, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are watched at watching this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You are being watched by Roy and his team that would like to record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you paused, which parts you skipped or check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process the data and this is the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make Sitcom more than four republican US Senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show, because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- so something about the average, but not just what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time at another company has plazed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he does something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organized a competition, he and his team have looked at the existing data about the Netflix spectators, i.e. the reviews that give them the shows whose course shows it etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had gathered all the pieces, they went into a venture and decided not to make a Sitcom above four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this Show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has made a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" receives a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what is happening here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data diversified firms.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision that you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimised by a very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The worst thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is not working, this is a bit scary, because we are living in a time we are going to make more and more statistics in order to make serious decisions more than television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes to touch with this software. come in contact, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If anyone is in prison in the USA and asking for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal takes place or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Mediocre TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. it is not that a company does not know how multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data seest companies are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it was done by data analysis outbreaks of flu, the worse way -- by data analysis of the Google Research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news station. success culminated in a release in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked just fine, year around year until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the withdrawal of publication in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sealed companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these mistakes, data is going to be in decisions of life -- on the workplace, in case of legal enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So, we should rather make sure data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some samples above the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and non-successful decisions. this design should be widespread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you can mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">When replacing this problem in its components, so that you can analyse the components; as a second, you put the items together again to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to grasp the parts again, and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool, and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it's parts and pieces put together again, even if the information is incomplete to write a good decision -- especially when it's the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and understanding where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, what else they would not have been able to put together. but the decision, how to take all of these parts, put together again and make it a show like "House of Cards" that did not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they went a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used to control all their decisions, first as they wager to TV ideas when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they always could say: "they say the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, dates are just one tool, and to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the tool for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it is amazing. for decisions with a Ja- or No-question you only need to shake the ball in order to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- exactly here in this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll find it later with a demo demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I met some decisions in my life, in which I should have listened to the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated than data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">This is perhaps the ball wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is possible to make decisions at the end of the curve, if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I received this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still paid out, decisions to meet, an expert in what you do, and risks involved.</seg>
<seg id="1137">By the end, it is not the data, but the risks, with which you are landing at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
