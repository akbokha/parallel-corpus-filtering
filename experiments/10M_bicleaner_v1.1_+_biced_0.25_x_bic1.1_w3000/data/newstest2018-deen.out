Munich 1856 : four cards that change your view to the city
an Irish @-@ institution where young people are to meet .
a tomb of tomb , where it is dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small band@@ men generate the one @-@ day reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories at days .
it is nervous , when maps are not up to date .
everyone knows what had to be exciting , because the car Nav@@ i was showing a green meadow instead of a ring road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ l@@ ases , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ ex Bavaria of the State Government , are all other than currently - yet very reve@@ aling .
especially if you compare it with current online @-@ cards .
then , how cities and municipalities have changed in the distribution area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Flick@@ r carpet , which one recogni@@ zes as such as such .
for cities and municipalities , detailed maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ pris@@ als , were born .
these were created according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing administration between 1810 and 1864 and from the first survey of Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave an top@@ ographical survey of Bay@@ erns on behalf - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops finally moved with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 1801 , the present neighbors , who created the idea of a wide @-@ wide Bavaria @-@ card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st@@ Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian survey@@ ing management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of Munich dates from the year 1856 and is like all others on the Bavarian State library &apos;s website .
the comparison list / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is lower @-@ w@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , in 1877 , as the Munich district .
today rests in the middle of the city .
the houses of the houses are concentrated in 1856 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the insur@@ rection of the Bavarian farmers in 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park is today , you can see nothing but fields - at the first glance : when Hin@@ sch@@ zo@@ oming appears a smaller map with dozens lines and numbers : handwritten notes from the so @-@ called &quot; jungle &quot; from which the base tax was derived .
there are no farmers here today , but small farmers in the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is characterised by the north of send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 scene of the October Revolution , was actually a meadow in the 19th century , and there was no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the urine paper , one reads in the area of today &apos;s au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , not just the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g , &quot; or by the An@@ ge &quot; On the ventilation &quot; - but also in great letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one was locked once people with mad@@ ness .
in 1858 / 59 there was the Munich Circle Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ders . &quot;
in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den presi@@ ded up the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the chains of the so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he instructed the staff to apply violence against the passengers , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
it was first place for 280 patients , later extended to 500 seats .
at some point , this capacity could not suff@@ ice - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ er@@ ren@@ dition in Hair 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts since 2006 .
in the area of the former Au@@ er institution , young people meet in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ um .
the Order bought the building complex in 1920 , and turned him to a youth home with education .
to the west is the football field of TS@@ V Munich east , east residential houses from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in an architectural reference to the Department of Government of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt who had been destroyed during the Second World War on bombing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1856 , the Kauf@@ straße was named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Allied forces seized a lot of holes in the city center in December 1944 .
a big stayed until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English institute , small business houses and a tomb of the Middle Ages , once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days are the pre@@ limin@@ aries and the ground @-@ breaking ceremony on 5 April 2017 .
with the shooting eg@@ ler , the old Munich map can compare the aerial view of today &apos;s aerial view - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil law group publishes it@@ iner@@ ary for Mis@@ souri
the National Association for the promotion of Far@@ ming has issued a warning for colored people due to discrimin@@ ating policies and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Mis@@ souri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ souri , who will go into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a number of question@@ able , racial @-@ based incident at the last time can occur throughout the whole state and stated here , &quot; says it in the position of the Group .
a recent law of Mis@@ souri , which makes people harder to gain discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , who aim to dis@@ regard minority interests , promp@@ ted the group to publish the it@@ iner@@ ary , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; they have injury of civil rights , which happen to humans .
they will be stopped due to their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency which we haven &apos;t heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organisation has issued for a state in the US .
the group cited inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist fights against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances in the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and taken care of the police of Mis@@ souri by viol@@ ating a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the General Office of Mis@@ souri by the fact that black mot@@ orists in the state will be 75 percent more common than white . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff know about what could happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be willing , whether it will bring bud@@ get@@ ary money or the relatives to travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ souri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s crime @-@ report program , which ranks the state in terms of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country .
the it@@ iner@@ ary is also an answer to a new Mis@@ souri law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had adopted travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , after the states that immigration laws have committed to viol@@ ate people due to immigration cases , which will contribute to further investigation in the AC@@ L@@ U .
it@@ iner@@ aries are generally issued by the State Department for other countries , but in recent times , stakeholders have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States .
crossover project is elem@@ ent@@ ar
the Fischer@@ b@@ acher Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Parliamentary Group of the Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac were found in front of a picture .
at the right yard of the Schwen@@ demann family , representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s fishing ban came together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .
Markus Schwen@@ demann initially best@@ ows insights into his farm in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows , and also many k@@ itt@@ ens and houses in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is responsible for the milk of its cows , as swi@@ v@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the table of the Feri@@ a , there is only regional .
as he is also called BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fis@@ bach &apos;s fishing law , it is called &quot; elementary project . &quot;
I can not generate moment@@ ous surfaces on der@@ art .
the green spaces should work for a lot of work , much has to be dealt with the engine sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here with the terms and with the top@@ ography &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Schwen@@ demann stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the el@@ eventh plant and bought these without chemical plant protection and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , even if it does not lead to bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e recognized the meaning of the dec@@ imal project and is glad about the leader of the leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , the farmers had to be supported .
one hope that the capacity of the areas could still be moved quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how they continue to continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often standing in criticism due to the promotion
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the dis@@ closure surface is therefore 40 hectares , which are not permitted until at least 20@@ 23 .
for the total cost of 71 500 Euros , half of the leader was promoted , a quarter took the municipality of Fish@@ bach .
in this way , farmers have had to invest 12 610 Euro , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometres .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of f@@ ences , &quot; explained to Schwen@@ demann .
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do not make a really good job without farmers and land@@ ladies . &quot;
also for Peter White : &quot; here best foods are produced . &quot;
the rural areas of agriculture ( l@@ p@@ r ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables state @-@ to @-@ state support of Wei@@ de@@ f@@ ences .
the aim is the revel@@ ations of the Black Forest .
pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of one of the l@@ p@@ r recorded funding .
in addition , the fenced area should not be worse ( hang@@ s over 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by the cancellation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the 2018 fishing commercial project 2018 the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometers of fence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dis@@ closure surface corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking into the Statue of Liberty
the most secure sign of a regime change is to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as every other - hence the ass@@ orted overthrow of Saddam Hussein &apos;s Fir@@ dos in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the tr@@ ump regime , knew surely what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in an heat dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CNN via the president &apos;s dr@@ astic limitation with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller doesn &apos;t handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of the owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ers would have laugh@@ ed at him if he had done it .
but he attacked their importance , and especially the importance that you were attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument he was added .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta decides , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tened the world .
the poem , which you refer , which was later added and not part of the original statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is objec@@ tively correct , but as he form@@ ulated it , it is not really about history .
it &apos;s about the contemporary reson@@ ance on the touching words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; thy tr@@ ash , your poor , and your th@@ ron@@ ged masses , who desire to breathe freely , and into the waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ ting waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller does not engage in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confron@@ tation : it is in fact a conflict around the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death on the base , knew very good that they had completed a high political action .
the sculpture was to show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ans , showing a classical painting representation of the female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom .
Lazarus altered this importance . in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice .
and she herself has a completely different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the poem by the image is a brilliant feminist Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and as Lazarus had changed the importance of the statue , people wanted to change this from the right wing .
the great scre@@ am Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a sort of John the Baptist for coming from Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not to invite one but rather an early neo@@ conservative , who bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; lady Liberty is moving .
it should bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ches should not enligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot;
very unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh is encountered here .
the importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the view@@ point of perception .
the great phant@@ asy indeed of Lazarus was in it , as they see from the exhausted , end , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys were seen on the deck of ships .
it &apos;s in the true sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge , and have a chance to improve their lives .
their statue says to them the words of hope , and of the welcome you must hear .
and this is of course not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump will ever want to recognize .
her tor@@ ch shall not enligh@@ ten the way , but hatred , who is the only source of power to ign@@ ite .
World Championship 2017 : Neil Black asks the Scottish members of the UK
E@@ ili@@ dh Doyle remembers a time when only two Schot@@ t belonged to the team of Great Britain
the performance of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of Scottish cont@@ ingent will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017 , which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special is being developed , &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we will try to understand and we will continue until we find it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type in the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ alists @-@ candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ are , who have to compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah while E@@ ili@@ dh Doyle , as captain of the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a series of athletes , whether they were Scottish or where ever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were highly motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ dh produced very natural were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth silver medal winner , which will compete for their fifth world championships in the 400 m hur@@ dle , says it &apos;s &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Schot@@ t have been in the British crew .
the world &apos;s best total number of athletes at the world championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ distance Mu@@ ir leads to this path and has set up five British and two European records in the past year .
it will take part to the 1,500 m and 5,000 metres of runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman that is to be observed after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
he remembers her first World Championships , when the only other Scot@@ sman was Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; enor@@ mously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their fellow country@@ men do not only belong to the team , but in some cases even with the medals and the fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing to be team chapters , is that it was a great honor anyway , but to know that my team mates have voted for me and chose me , making it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the Sc@@ ots who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb at Po@@ sts .
what concerns my speech as captain ?
yes , I think it was fine .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Championship .
so , it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out and compete , and it will simply be a great atmosphere there . &quot;
blocking of critics via Facebook : don &apos;t get a public office if you do not wear the pre@@ heat of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it wasn &apos;t long until the newspapers struck him because of all , from the domestic policy up to its political principles .
he shy at the cri@@ tique , certainly .
but he did not put his critics into silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b we are led to the slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland Larry H@@ og@@ an who needs to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan@@ s employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people , and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union lam@@ ented him for this reason .
the governor &apos;s staff left the law@@ suit as a fri@@ vol@@ , and the online commentary was full of a counter@@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ishing popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors in the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
he has shown a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ fully sent to use Facebook as primary funds to link with his voters and to debate his hair @-@ loose head to chemotherapy in his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons who come to the page of the Governor - which is a public forum , which is officially designated as officially called and by employees who are paid with public tax @-@ Dollars - un@@ necessarily and finally dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan@@ s Inter@@ spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse denied the actions of the Govern@@ ors and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too simple to use the image of cast or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ orts filled people online the whi@@ ps online .
the mail spoke with some of the actual people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no tro@@ lls .
they all said that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan@@ s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bo@@ wie , MD , was not fulfilled , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented , that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the comment@@ aries of the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea when a number of people entitled to the same topic , then they will be ab@@ used by some rather than a so @-@ called collective use and is not recognized as a large group of people affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the govern@@ ors awarded as &quot; concentrated Spam Attack &quot; would probably be called &quot; interc@@ ession . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to share a message by blocking one critic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous time when you had the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical lad@@ les to burn , burn , or bring demonstr@@ ators to silence and to silence .
but exactly that happens just digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials , who critic@@ ises his Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused by Twitter users who blocked his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question occurred last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ visors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County viol@@ ates the First A@@ chiev@@ ment , according to the U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they named a elec@@ tor from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Pre@@ in ( R ) received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers watched between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters beat upon his guidance .
and even at that time Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
the people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters to papers , which caused Washington decisions .
petitions which critic@@ ised his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and navigation of the United Kingdom , critic@@ ised his office , according to the historic documents published by the George Washington Project .
but he didn &apos;t have it to silence .
freedom of expression , dis@@ agreements , and dis@@ courses belong to our nation &apos;s basis .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club
former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days for home comfort as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an organized the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who brought links to the final year in the field of Ar@@ cher@@ field , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , joined the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches his fame with this event , &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from its best site , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry made a great job , when he put this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of its performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to def@@ ending a championship for the first time even though he won the European Tour in his 32 @-@ year career as well as at the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really feels very special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player , in South@@ port , hit players &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open car since it was in the year after I had won them out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories come back last year and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon who came here last year .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came to his 50th birthday earlier this year on the European Senior Tour , returns to the homeland .
this event will be the first Scottish show ever since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more if you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing back , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m happy about how it went out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the trio in the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ o nam and Senior Major Champion Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ish .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six Schot@@ t on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
the entrance fee is free of charge , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a passengers and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers .
all proceeds going to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer through passive smoking
over the past two decades , less people have died due to passive smoking at lung cancer .
to this result , scientists from the University Clinic Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates per year 167 lung cancer medicines will be attributed to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said studies Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he moved his own study to this issue from 1994 .
at that time , there have been some 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
household connections prove themselves as a very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &apos; lie reason@@ ably in time , &quot; says the director of the court Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of hou@@ sem@@ inclu@@ sions , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as underground that does not forget a lot in the plans .
traffic , which again ob@@ struc@@ ts the construction work , represents a major problem for the construction of the St@@ ump@@ p company .
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of the drivers from red lights and barriers is already enormous , &quot; reports Hein@@ ze .

poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook the dinner , it does not use stove .
they even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the P@@ ani@@ ai regulations in the unknown ind@@ on@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife normally lays a sweet potato - locally referred to as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the stolen rat@@ chet is taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swallowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work , such as dresses with d@@ ull water from nearby sw@@ amp .
a bu@@ cket in a homeless room is used as a lat@@ rine .
as youngest of the four wives of her husband , you were not assigned to the fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be too dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many are difficult , and there are the soldiers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody w@@ ells it after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life of the high@@ land of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , only 1,0@@ 26 elders had to vote against the occupying troops .
an existing movement , which touched for independence against the Dutch dom@@ ination , turned rapidly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains the control of the region and foreign journalists or legal entities .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua New Guinea , where the independent part of Papua New Guinea belonged to the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so isolated as it is desolate . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transportation .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is composed of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo trees , and from cor@@ ru@@ gated tops which were converted into different gel@@ b@@ brown tones .
only a few Indon@@ esians have made their journey here , so@@ jour@@ ned journalists and practically no fore@@ ig@@ ner .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans sent a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their lively , hand@@ woven k@@ ban , her dar@@ ker shirt and her pale rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we only had some leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst kinder@@ garten and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but there is also Indonesia Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is situated only 60 miles from P@@ ani@@ ai , a high country provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was min@@ ed $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
moreover , Papua New resources are valued at an estimated $ 78 billion value .
however , these riches are a source of mis@@ ery for the Papua New , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s most powerful military keeps a suff@@ oc@@ ative presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military nationals and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 U.S. dollars a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anic recei@@ v@@ ables according to greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden G@@ ans and are mer@@ cil@@ essly treated .
according to activists of activists , more than 500,000 murders have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as headquarters in the 1970 @-@ 1940 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mass@@ acre in the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide in 1970 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the region alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Are all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a report of the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane , in the year 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electro@@ des are especially popular after another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
bolts have ampli@@ fied , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources take a stream of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development is changing since Muslim economic mig@@ rant originate from the most popul@@ ous islands of Java , Borneo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .

&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua New Guinea , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old P@@ ani@@ ai @-@ Local native to work in the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the local Papua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ er and Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke to the ine@@ qualities and violations of the rights violations in Papua New Year in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann insured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including P@@ ani@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua New it has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i with the expec@@ tation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is re @-@ established , &quot; says You .
in fact , P@@ ani@@ ai suffered a deep point for two months after Jok@@ hang &apos;s inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two ind@@ on@@ esian soldiers broke out on a motorbike through the darkness .
the frigh@@ tened children said to them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took the impulse to her tone , and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , and struck the group with their ri@@ sts , victims , and witnesses .
then , one of the soldiers fired in the children &apos;s group .
a child who was 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ ei@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard to beat that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the escal@@ ate things next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered in a football field before the local police station and the military commander to demand justice .
they carried bur@@ gl@@ ary hun@@ ts and carried the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bird wat@@ ering - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators began to change stones at police and military posts .
when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers sent a command via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses have more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it is said in an official document of TIM@@ E , which was not released in the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was able to listen in the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left hand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the TIM@@ E at the porch of its colorful wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
kay@@ aks still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cousin , the witness of the shooting was shot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and seeking his body to be certain that he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who , as many Indon@@ esians , bears only a name , the TIM@@ E in dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
the Che@@ ese spec@@ tor of the Papua New Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said rep@@ orters that his officers simply wanted to &quot; back &quot; because they become attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people are threatening to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua New Police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings were only filtered on the following day &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
in three weeks , Jok@@ hang i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura for the families of the victims , and weak@@ ened the historical abuse in Papua New .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that no longer will happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , Security Affairs Wir@@ anto said that he establishes an extra@@ judicial mechanism establishing historic human rights violations .
but the pron@@ unci@@ ation began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and in the beginning of the 2000 years .
the point is that we have committed to address these violations , but there are processes that need to run through , &quot; he said .
then Wir@@ anto then made a retreat when he spoke to the TIM@@ E at Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E , and said he had no plans to establish a complaint in Papua New .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , who has accused the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s blu@@ epr@@ int vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had been laid in Papua New , including the P@@ ani@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the P@@ ani@@ ai victims received such claims with Gri@@ mm@@ ean un@@ belie@@ ver .
&quot; I interviewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in P@@ ani@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the military after he helped four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot at vill@@ agers in P@@ ani@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between the vill@@ agers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a mal@@ icious man to hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year old ra@@ avi@@ an Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died in the hospital .
upward vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s site .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who re@@ acted to him by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian paramil@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed a killing .
&quot; we were so pan@@ icked , we are afraid that it will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who was living near the hospital and witnessed how the injured here is , so the TIM@@ E .
&quot; I have hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called on to withdraw the involved officers and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police from the territory .
P@@ ani@@ ai was always an inv@@ ent for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ land of Papua New Guinea .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua New Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua New , by force spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of ind@@ on@@ esian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from P@@ ani@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in P@@ ani@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily arrested in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
under the people in Papua ist P@@ ani@@ ai known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here are building everything they eat : mostly Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they reserve most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a produce only 10,000 Indonesian Rup@@ iah ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the local Papua New and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new floods .
the few jobs that exist in the region will usually go to the better trained and weal@@ thy migrants .
Papua , rarely the capital , or the necessary skills to lead their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; said John G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribe of P@@ ani@@ ai .
Isolation is holding the eyes of the world from Papua New .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media are ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua New , although the rare permission was given for films .
according to P@@ hel@@ per K@@ ine , the deputy Asian director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ hang is poll@@ ing to raise the restrictions on reporting to enhance transparency and development .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia un@@ quiet provinces of Papua and West pap@@ a : vis@@ as ref@@ using and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to the Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s immediate neighbours .
in March , six Pacific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the islands of Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ - and the Salom@@ onen Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua New , including P@@ ani@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there is free media , so it is difficult to tu@@ alize the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
people want to know that more foreign governments take this knowledge .
as a official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura took their silence on the 4th of May . we want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session , but anonymous .
Indonesia has given another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua New states that they probably won &apos;t be right again for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the P@@ ani@@ ai shots , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the Chairman of the tribe of Directors .
he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the P@@ ani@@ ai people believe that it lives among the permanent threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services .
G@@ ob@@ ai says that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , like other Papua New , can consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; fault &quot; which he must pay back .
&quot; you don &apos;t need money , they just want righteousness , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the P@@ ani@@ ai @-@ Shi@@ ps resulted in the last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ pse of a victim was buried on a terrain opposite the police and the military station .
they know that you may never forget justice , but at least they didn &apos;t forget their crimes committed to their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with direct head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai to the second time
a fire was held on Friday in one of the highest residential doors in the world in Dubai . hundreds of residents , from the 337 m high , 79 @-@ storey building to flee .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps in only two years by the rise , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with fire alarm and scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we went down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor down below , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling a resident who named his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dub@@ ais civilian authorities said that the units of the fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cool .
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident may answer questions about the safety of materials that are used in outer areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage caused by the cl@@ adding , the exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation .
in Britain , the police reported that the system of plates to isolation and cl@@ adding to the rapid spread of a fire in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : continuing Best @-@ of @-@ Five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through its great Davis Cup Cou@@ p during the general meeting .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , this sport revolutionary suggestion , Davis Cup single was only supported on two winners , Hau@@ ch@@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
the although often very long , but therefore also very estimated five @-@ sentence classics remain the traditional result .
6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of member countries voted for reform , the objective of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , was therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work on to improve the rate .
not until the vote had come after many in@@ consisten@@ cies before the proposal came to fill the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 are just compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will in future have the host right next round .
in order to decrease the cost of organis@@ ers , the requirements will be facil@@ itated on training plans , etc. and players will need to complete the Davis Cup less official media schedule .
more than 1 of 5 US trav@@ eler brings forbidden items into aircraft , finds a survey
a survey of flying objects revealed that more than 20 percent consciously or un@@ consciously prohibited items to the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration are ir@@ on@@ ated , among them at least 6 percent , who entered the plane , while they acci@@ dentally banned knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had delayed until they were mistak@@ enly with fire@@ arms , amm@@ o or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people - that was performed by a Jet @-@ charter service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger trav@@ ellers rather im@@ itate the rules .
of those questioned that they tried that they tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als were compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common items that were inten@@ tionally inf@@ ested at T@@ SA agents were food@@ stuffs and liquids .
more than 3 percent accepted , wit@@ t@@ ingly items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of women surveyed and 3.7 percent of the male respondents have also confirmed that they have been deliberately banned drugs in the aircraft .
the company said that I asked travelers in all the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware would have brought through the airport security and how many would have been deliberately committed .
it is no surprise that people who are most frequently s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware - know@@ ingly or ignor@@ ant - through the safety , those who are most frequently flying .
the company however suggests that the T@@ SA direc@@ tives are something complicated and conf@@ using .
people often are uncertain who allow liquids to bring them away , or how much of it .
therefore , it is no surprise that the greatest amount of people seized by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
a long time the people thought , T@@ SA could see books as a s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware .
liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k are gladly available with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far , he has under@@ gone so far that a part of the customer has already withdrawn their non @-@ committ@@ al reservation .
in addition to the more triumph@@ ant figures , Tesla chief El@@ on Mus@@ k has predicted significant numbers for the first time in the announcement of recent quarterly figures for the first time : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k had often applied more than 500.000 reservations for the new car in recent months , whose extradition is just starting .
now Mus@@ k is dre@@ aming : a total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders had already been withdrawn from 6@@ 3.000 times .
critics have always been pointed out , that only for non @-@ committ@@ al reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) .
currently 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ committ@@ al reservations used , spatial muscle in a telephone conference with analysts are currently underway .
however , that the cancellation of some twelve percent of all orders could be a problem , however , the Tesla boss does not believe .
his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site .
in last year , Tesla delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 it is expected - all models taken together - 500,000 will be one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to the Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are currently available .
those who currently ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; is ordered in the second half of 2018 with delivery - if Tesla manages to drive his brand new , never in practice @-@ tested production lines without any major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum occupancy rate .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , it comes to greater del@@ ays , then the non@@ committ@@ ment could be made to the problem for Tesla .
because then , the company can &apos;t hin@@ der their satisfied customers in dro@@ ves .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt goes back because of the delay of Obama &apos;s rules to reduce emissions
one day after he had been accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , had taken his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era to reduce emissions Smo@@ g caused air pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency turned to the needs of state environmental authorities against re@@ ac@@ tions@@ qu@@ icker than previous administration .
he didn &apos;t claim the law@@ suit that was raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ als .
it &apos;s about a deadline that ran on October 1 for states to hold the standards of 2015 for ground @-@ growing o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will go out to comply with his authority to study more time to study the plan and to prevent &quot; in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in Oklahoma , before his appointment by president Donald Tr@@ ump Public Prosecutor of Oklahoma , was a long time a reliable ad@@ versaries of more demanding environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to block regulations , or delayed , to resist the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
sudden return of wed@@ nesday is the most recent legal return for the regular roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington decided that the EPA Administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to monitor the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas businesses to monitor and reduce methane le@@ cks , to delay .
on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his turn @-@ turn in o@@ zone @-@ standards just simply put the read@@ iness of EPA to co @-@ operation with the states through the complex process of tim@@ ely fulfilling the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administration , the EPA often has not maintained the dead@@ lines and then accused of committ@@ ing force arms and others , and in an agreement to determine the event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation with judicial proceedings , and we take a serious job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA reported that P@@ ru@@ itt asks his &quot; satisfaction to delay and any other legal authority &quot; to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans will push for a more comprehensive restructuring of the o@@ zone rules .
one of the last month &apos;s auth@@ oriz@@ ations should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not admitted to the Senate in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the US coalition government , said the EPA in this week , said the group intend to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - after our law@@ suits - is an important profit for health and security of those 6.7 million of New York , who are affected directly from the smo@@ g that flows in their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Li@@ sylv@@ anian , Rhode Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington , and the District of Columbia .
ground @-@ o@@ zone is created , if pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemistry plants and other sources react in sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems with sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature death cases every year .
the representative of public health and environmental prot@@ esters che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ sters a surprising change of course .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ide@@ ological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to opp@@ ose environmental impact and its special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche on the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16 at 16.@@ 30 am invited to a seren@@ ade .
whether his idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the Six@@ th Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z @-@ Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted from this powerful place .
salvation and preservation of the oldest building in the resort have made friends and convey@@ ors of tum@@ ours about their inten@@ tions .
Walter Martin@@ i emphas@@ ises : &quot; it &apos;s a unique sweet little od@@ ine . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ k@@ elle was mentioned for the first time in the Württem@@ bür@@ g@@ ical certificate , Count Hermann of Sul@@ z , and the V@@ og@@ tei &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the origins of the certificate on the Tum@@ linger hill , there was also a magnificent courtyard , which belonged to the church , or the patron saint , and not vice versa .
there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , beside the under@@ village and the Ober@@ dorf , which today in the village of Tum@@ lingen was still visible , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement center of the village .
old maps from the period around the year 1600 were under@@ min@@ ted these historical conditions .
the pat@@ ron@@ eous arose from the early medieval y@@ ol@@ factory law .
a lord who built a church , and occupied with a pastor , remains the owner of this church , and could also inherit these self @-@ monks .
thus , the right to use a minister , or to suggest the bishop for a new priest .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells in the tower .
the Gre@@ at@@ est of the two towers to Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rock@@ ed for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be left later in 1942 in the Second World War .
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows are wrapped and the bell rack were stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
in 1796 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the ch@@ urch@@ yard , they used it as a fire@@ wood .
re@@ mn@@ ants of the church threatened to collapse in 1809 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead out of hearing .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ Church was broken .
only the steep@@ le was made .
in the New Year &apos;s eight 1834 , a storm split the steep@@ le and the half collapsed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was broken off .
only today &apos;s existing Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained the witness of the 750 @-@ year old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em take care of the &quot; creative pension &quot; as the successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn .
as organizer , the friends and promot@@ er of tum@@ ours on Sunday , July 16 , the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery at St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Kepler high school in Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matt@@ eis .
the centre of Hartmut Rom@@ ann talks the closing word .
the programme starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 .
the Ser@@ en@@ ade horri@@ ble takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view over meadows up to the woods , &quot; the organizers provide the fantastic view .
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only at dry weather .
the organizers now hope for many supporters to the ob@@ taining of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of significance for Tum@@ lingen and hearing .
the friends and promot@@ er of tum@@ ours feel particularly committed to home care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade organizer Walter Martin@@ i .
association wants to check approval of wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; honor &quot; is not a legal requirement for construction and has therefore turned to the land rat .
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim are instructed &quot; by Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the N@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines would have been approved , as at the time in quad@@ ru@@ ding , only at the border line to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal exists a wind force concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind power plants are basically possible , but at the same time , the concentration zone causes wind energy use for the rest of the city area .
such zones are supposed to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
although the town of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind turbine zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but they had not been approved by the Düsseldorf district of Düsseldorf , because of a formula .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planned legal requirement is the granted auth@@ orization to proceed as before illegal and because of this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current state of things : the Stad@@ thalle covered the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a approval of the district government is still standing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this place the issu@@ ance of approval for the construction of wind power plants is excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been received since last week at the circle of Vier@@ sen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle , on occasion , takes it to the occasion to re@@ examine the matter .
they are likely to run , however , that the procedure is stopped .
with a view of the proceedings at the administrative court , the circle on Thursday was not willing to express itself in terms of the reas@@ oning of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 metres high wind turbines .
already last year , the company , in which the town of Vier@@ sen , is involved in the city of Vier@@ sen , closed P@@ acht@@ contracts with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the establishment of the four wind power plants , the power demand for around 11 400 households should be covered - this is equivalent to around one @-@ fifth of all four @-@ sen@@ iors .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer there were a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Wind@@ park Lin@@ nich in Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind power plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and Trac@@ tor : woman dies with terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident took place on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ w ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn county ) .
a woman was wounded to death .
two more people were slightly injured .
the state road was locked over hours .
according to the police figures , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman made from Bor@@ nich with their cars as part of the accompanying driver with their 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as supporting the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ w .
city and dealers plan &quot; Home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shops in the city centre in September .
the commercial club and the municipal authorities want to take advantage of the weekend on September 8 and 9 in order to attract the inhabitants for shopping spre@@ e in the city center .
as the chairman of the commercial @-@ one , Christian König , announced , the &quot; homeland @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend is meant to sensi@@ ize the customers that offers its own city away from the usual supermarket @-@ commodity .
the market is also a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market .
moreover , native companies are to present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips .
in addition , the shops of the city center will invite to &quot; mit@@ ting @-@ t@@ opp@@ en &quot; shops .
this action is not only in the residents of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which point to the action weekend , so Christian König .
municipal management and commercial organization collabor@@ ate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
thus , the commercial club and the city is located in another stage of the &quot; attrac@@ tive city center . &quot;
these include new offers , such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well @-@ held open Sunday , discussions with all tra@@ ders and hosts to move it to active participation .
also attractive offers for Saturday and the aband@@ on@@ ment on parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
these include students and tourists .
but many locals had lost the city center when shopping comes out of sight .
at the end , all of them would have to contribute to the city center - to the land@@ lords , the factories all over the city and associations .
it was done to overcome the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y network with a network that partly spread broad@@ ly , King had said in the spring .
Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK Center in Mühl@@ hausen , shared that five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities are taking part in the nationwide third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day for the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should adver@@ tise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and establish its significance for the community of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stre@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the promotion of co@@ ders of the I@@ HK and with many partners also make clear that every citizen can influence its direct environment itself .
two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
during construction , there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new further people were injured .
at a gas explosion in the U.S. city Minneapolis there are two people killed and nine other injured , some of them seriously .
according to the fire brig@@ ade was last Wednesday ( local time ) a last in critical state .
a person died when a part of a school building on the explosion collapsed .
a first viol@@ inist later became dead also dead .
among the dead people acted out of school .
as a mis@@ fortun@@ atel@@ ic the authorities suspected working on a gas pipe .
there were only a few people in the building of the Min@@ l@@ aha Academy .
Tr@@ ump consisted of telephone calls on telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the mar@@ g@@ inal wall
tran@@ scri@@ ptions by telephone calls between US president Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January Tr@@ ump filed in a phone conversation with the Mexican president Enrique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned dam .
the US president hun@@ ted him because he had den@@ ounced the wall in public . according to report , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall in the southern border of the USA , and swore to Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first annex@@ e with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Gym were also published and revealed a shared exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the United States , who immig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; was and that the existence on trade that would look at him like a &quot; dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull &quot; that &apos;s the unpleasant call for all the day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford Mass@@ acre : activists do rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men with ri@@ fl@@ es stand to block his way .
the leader of the M@@ obs - a young middle @-@ aged aged in a needle @-@ strip - took a long train at its cig@@ ar , looking through the wind@@ shield .
inside sh@@ ew@@ ed the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ ared the man .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams rent the still@@ ness , when a young black man was demol@@ ished from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only a reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; nearly all of them went very me@@ ticul@@ ous in the audience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 Mayor &apos;s Ford Bridge is back to the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com , as well as George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - were collected by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever charged with murder .
&quot; it &apos;s really in@@ comprehen@@ sible that in all those years no one person was arrested - even though we know they are in our churches even though we know who they are , &quot; Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in the organisation of reproduction .
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a load for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former congress of the State of Georgia and a life of citizenship .
for him , the position as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that has never been corrected in@@ justice .
&quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want to termin@@ ate , we want recovery , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to heal and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bed minister puts a bed towel over the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files that were obtained by NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one has ever been indicted .
although the susp@@ ects remain on free foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions were always known throughout the city : Politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court rendered its vote to the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote their voice in the summer .
about at the same time as the choice was according to the FBI , the black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett v@@ ester , fighting for a struggle - allegedly for a woman .
bro@@ o@@ ks said that rum@@ our had been in the city that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby , which she carried her not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when she moved away from the prison and approaching the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b inv@@ aded the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison who has prepared the kill@@ ings and ordered , &quot; includes a FBI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution that had not only been involved in killing , elim@@ inating evidence and identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ o@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more predic@@ tive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register , and if you vote , it will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ene , Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ene has led the annual desc@@ endant of the Moore Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their display is illu@@ stra@@ tive , moving , and is based in a type of deep rac@@ ism , many believed that he doesn &apos;t exist anymore in America .
it &apos;s difficult to look , and still difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we will be confron@@ ted with us in all things , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of Black - entered into a room and lou@@ der , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played review of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ enes Co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of the boss of C@@ lan@@ t for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty , because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ ru@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , who plays Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett v@@ ester , their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester scre@@ ams and pushed him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he w@@ asted away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a bl@@ ur@@ izes the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody ( at least all the black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the loud .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ con@@ a asked .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still ti@@ dy .
&quot; I don &apos;t think white people at that time &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; funny one of the other black perform@@ ers .
you only need to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and as it shifts the energy in the room , a feeling of camera gu@@ ardi@@ ans replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy trying to get this properly , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene is once again .
this time , when Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition is violent and fast .
there is scre@@ ams , shots , and then silence .
a woman , dressed with a funeral dress , stands over the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads tax@@ ing Holidays to praise &quot; Strange Fru@@ it . &quot;
her voice breaks every second word .
approximately one hundred metres behind this , a group of about four dozen people sho@@ ots out sweat and tears out of the eyes .
the audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come only down the street .
they have experienced Georgia almost eight hours , while bro@@ o@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bst@@ ones of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the murders have stayed an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you find on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels at .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and to insp@@ ect the dead bodies .
children ho@@ cks to their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing one another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ ur a little boy , as if he would remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a couple of minutes , Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ x we@@ dge and wi@@ pe her tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w is surrounded by Brad@@ sha@@ w , the man in suit that played the c@@ lan@@ derer .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a hu@@ gs two of his te@@ amm@@ ers and then breaks down in her arms , the emotional bur@@ dens of the performance finally breaks out with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience sits together with the actors for dinner .
chat@@ ted with a table , a white pair of Atlanta excited about the reproduction of a black pair , which they met just now .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski continued to find words which feeling the performance left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like you and those that do what they look like , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what does that really do with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch still continues to continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today the only police firing is called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks &apos;s yard keeps on his desk , he eats and remembers the civil rights .
he said he started planning to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the evidence is inspiring in a certain way , since it describes the horror of what we bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so if we learn nothing of it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who does not study his own history , who doesn &apos;t know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wagner to Bayreuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s mon@@ umental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf reli@@ es on a colourful fri@@ vol@@ ous production of gigantic , six @-@ storey setting .
the revol@@ ving platform ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows a sh@@ ab@@ ort street corner with a laying of a wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car in which the Rhine le@@ thal is pos@@ ing as a rock , or an alternative to Is@@ etta .
st@@ acked oil waters recall Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - that attracts attention through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three heads of Rhine - sung by Stephanie H@@ out@@ ze@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ball and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ize as in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; .
she left Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , in Hollywood &apos;s manipul@@ ator a cor@@ pse in the trunk and give the Kra@@ allo Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderful fi@@ dd@@ in Hagen , which surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weights .
brutal Sc@@ ene , when he proposes Siegfried .
I also have to believe Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) .
the audience thanks to the ensemble with powerful applause .
Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who makes himself modest and le@@ aned the hands of Merkel @-@ smokers .
large applause are available for the festival orchestra , which shows the first time on stage - in view of the big heat again in empty leisure clothing .
the performance by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ et@@ eam was eag@@ erly anticipated .
in 2013 , he had to leave a pipe on the Pfei@@ f@@ concert in 2013 , five years later , in which the single &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; ru@@ e went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to be happy about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in certain ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also an understanding of its view .
I draw a positive res@@ ume .
max Quanti@@ ty works as volunteers
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where to everywhere ?
quantity : normally in Stein@@ furt in the furniture market , once a week , I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I already worked in the open all day at school .
what are your experiences with that ?
quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with you@@ ths , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , thus a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does this come ?
quantity : I have made high school high school .
and then a building engineer , let &apos;s say successful .
I know for me that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else to work with people .
and then I asked myself what you are doing .
take a social year , there is a gli@@ mp@@ se , there you can see how it is on @-@ site , in the focal point maybe , really is .
and was it like that ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social worker education and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule .
is it not unusual , while volunteers have several different projects ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where you will be FS@@ J .
you can make it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also part of the O@@ gs , thus in the afternoon care .
for me it was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different than in civil engineering ?
a lot : well , here it is not about to calculate st@@ ati@@ ks .
you always have other people in front of them , each of which have a very different story .
whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been picked out of the family - you always have to go individually .
very interesting .
and they had no contact affair ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
a lot of love , plenty of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s the way life is .
Pear@@ son abbrevi@@ ated more 3,000 jobs and short@@ ens the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut their interim report by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure on which the company is confron@@ ted .
the job loss , which announced the Director General John Fall@@ on mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , arrives in addition to its previous restructuring , which already lost 4,000 positions .
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction program to cost another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business , which was hit by quick step to digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House last month , said that the outlook for fiscal year was unchanged , after having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
con@@ voy of Kabul : NATO soldier killed at self @-@ murder
a suicide bom@@ ber killed a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kabul , killed by NATO soldiers and injured several other people , officials said .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were injured , an Declaration of Nato .
according to local reports , there were also three civilians during the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a position of Nato , it is said that the explosion happened on Thursday evening when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army carried out improvis@@ ing explo@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured in a stable state will be treated in the US military hospital in B@@ agra@@ m .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing force of the Taliban and the group , known as so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops at the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , suicide bom@@ bers killed at least 30 people in a chi@@ ef@@ ite district of Kabul .
the Taliban said they allegedly carried out this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country , the Taliban kidnapped by power in 2001 .
violence under@@ scores the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. president Donald Tr@@ ump is weak@@ ened , the number of US forces to support the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that suicide attacks in Kabul in the past weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , politics and especially in the call of President Ash@@ raf G@@ ani .
EPA Con@@ trac@@ ts Dec@@ ision to Del@@ ay Smo@@ g Rule according to Kl@@ agen
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay a government regulation of Obama administration , which the States is obliged to sl@@ ate Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 States accused the agency because of the pac@@ emaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced it late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said , showing the commitment to the agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react on our state partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA in June to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which in a part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions should be determined to stick to stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the Colombia district , filed an action on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of president Donald Tr@@ ump tried to imp@@ ose a wide range of environmental defe@@ ats , which imposed the former President Barack Obama as part of a wider agenda that aims to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , efforts have caused the set@@ backs of the Democrats and nature groups that worry about the impact of larger emissions on public health .
the EPA &apos;s website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , o@@ zone contains &quot; reduces lung function and rein@@ force respiratory symptoms , &quot; such as asthma .
Communal space , common room
at the end , the decision was clear : with two votes to vote , the municipality of Flu@@ orn Win@@ inkl@@ es decided to establish a common room in the future residential community .
prior to discussion there is an important information : the contract contract for the missing basic piece is signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades reported .
although there will be even more planning , until the church &apos;s church is owned by the church , but now there is no plans for a private investor to st@@ em@@ ming the project .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat , offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of area available for a special price .
the administration and majority of the Municipal Council ho@@ vers , such a common room is not as meeting point for the residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ tic residential area , but open to the church .
as an example , the word &quot; kn@@ itted café &quot; made the round .
the decision , due to the provision of funds for the current budget , has already been determined in the last autumn , by convey@@ ing possibilities .
the construction is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be , reports T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the decision is to signal to the investor that it does not want to imp@@ ose a p@@ ples between the legs , the conclusion is that both ar@@ tic - which is based on the environmental protection - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - what the tear @-@ height decreases and the construction of economic power - that would be possible .
need@@ less , this is not only Wil@@ fried sole , be this addition .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the panel .
not so easy with common room .
Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many of its own buildings with which one is not so moving forward , but now you are going to play with the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; I am hard to do with it . &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ ess talks to the common room - but absolutely against a public participation .
it sees behind a covered sub@@ sid@@ y on the assets or even foreign investors .
that is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface there is no chance , but get a real one , in the case of doubt , the counter@@ speech is .
Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s request , to charge resolutions , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
so it remains in two counter@@ parts of the original program to summar@@ ize Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; when we summar@@ ize the decision , we make a giant kick , a big hole in our infrastructure . &quot;

move to Star in the resin of Stern
the nation &apos;s first &quot; star@@ path &quot; should be created in the resin .
this plant is planning to the Club Observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet track in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star@@ path &quot; coming to the information per@@ ple@@ tion of many res@@ ent@@ ations , it was called .
he uses nature , science , movement and sporty performance .
the members want to set up along the planned route boards and inform about stars and stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase to 2018 the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good att@@ ain@@ able installations is planning to set up five to six places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question@@ ing St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ er , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tablets will be supple@@ mented by the Internet .
therefore , a good mobile network takes place in the location selection .
also accessibility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the star@@ path should be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad , the viewer experienced a lot of knowledge worth knowing about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , they learned why stars could have different colors , or why a star would seem stronger than another , even though he is much further removed .
also , in which the constellation can find a selected star and when it is best to see .
since 2014 , the association has been running the highest observ@@ atory observ@@ atory in northern Germany since 2014 .
according to information from the Federal Government in Har@@ z , the national park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often seen from there from the Mil@@ ky Way , and even the Andromeda Galaxy can clearly see the naked eye .
in the Uni city there has been a little similar to the Planet@@ arium Go@@ ett@@ ingen initiative since 2003 , something similar to the planned star @-@ throw - the planet .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ dy Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet@@ arium will carry up to the Hain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as a &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the pra@@ w@@ ns with the individual planet - including the d@@ warf @-@ placed de@@ mot@@ ed plug@@ to at the end point - are positioned to be exact in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the Earth shr@@ inks on a bul@@ let of 6.5 milli@@ meters diameter , while the sun is barely 75 meters away from the sun at least 70 cen@@ tim@@ eters .
the entire distance of the planet is just four kilometers .
while the light of the sun is needed up to about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour to St@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than the light in the universe .
the march to the next fi@@ xation was going to last another year .
Mik@@ ey Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ bard meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Garcia that should be in a coll@@ ision to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN @-@ offices in Los Angeles , to Garcia the un@@ lag@@ ged World Bo@@ xing Council &apos;s Ligh@@ tweight Champion , the corridor went down to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organisation Super @-@ spring champion class .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory through unanim@@ ous decision about the former Four @-@ Di@@ visi@@ ons world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und List .
Garcia took his right hand and said , &quot; How are you , Champion ?
I wish you lots of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ m@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 19 : 00 pm .
when the couple posed for photographs , Lom@@ m@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is climate noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size order . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; re@@ minded Garcia .
&quot; I have risen to Bron@@ er &#91; at 140 &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small for 140 .
I &apos;d like to come down on lightweight .
and he has to move on a light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this will demand the fans .
let &apos;s give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ m@@ enko voted to agree .
&quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot;
climate wondered if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ m@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to agree on the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after its lightweight @-@ weight champion in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; this battle could be held in the pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans wondered after him , &quot; said Garcia and pushed forward to fight with the network that offers the best financial package .
we are the best .
no other names can generate this type of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Garcia he said , he reck@@ ons Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ m@@ enko held with the generous praise to Garcia for Garcia that he think that he is thinking of River@@ side Champion , &quot; very slowly , I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to do the co @-@ off . &quot;
Garcia said the focus was to show perc@@ ussions , then boxing .
both said they could feel the moment@@ um that built up for his own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that needs to be performed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates as much attention and enthusiasm .
I &apos;m more than happy to work , &quot; he said .
Lom@@ m@@ enko said , &quot; I waited for the top fighters and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great struggle . &quot;
four injured after tire plat@@ ters
during an accident at the A7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost more than 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock shortly before the connection of the market segment , presumably after a ty@@ re plat@@ ter .
after the right , the car wash down into the bu@@ ds where he beat himself and then lie on the roof in the green stre@@ ak .
four passengers - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured rescue service , the A7 towards the north was locked towards the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left @-@ left stre@@ ak could pass by the accident path .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; turning chain works better &quot;
And@@ re Hoffmann is hoping for the season op@@ ener for Braunschweig , that the optimization of the def@@ enses with Au@@ e points will take place .
with the first season of season , And@@ re Hoffmann was pleased with the result , there were not the two areas in the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to adapt to Au@@ e even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge , the triple chain should also be optimized .
and a gate after a free fall , the progression would no longer be cat@@ ching .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future there will be so that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) puts it on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew is also better right after the experience in preparation with the three chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm funk , but Hoffmann is his cause safe , &quot; because we have just in the three @-@ position in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ieß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well . &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the requirement is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ious and we do not afford so many play@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
naturally Hoffmann also rides to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you can speak after a draw from a mis@@ chiev@@ ous start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we can point out on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the trop@@ hy , we will surely be able to speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his coach would not want to know anything .
&quot; I first took the start into the season after six to eight playing days , &quot; Fried@@ helm funk , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony had to be broken in Hei@@ den@@ heim for an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home match , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believe that players from Au@@ e may even be something fresh , as they had no serious and complete game like Fort@@ una against a asc@@ end favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know about 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the holder of the Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although guests from the Rhin@@ eland go to the Rhin@@ eland as a lighter favourite on Sunday to the encounter at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we have taken them away , only because we are entitled to come under the first six , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2 . Bundesliga which one has to hit from planned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ unas Chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
the recent findings of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , showing that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes on accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Ri@@ fu@@ gi@@ um ) has begun to carry out the tests in the past year .
during the asylum procedure , they should be more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration authority ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) due to defects in jud@@ ging the correct age of some refugees were min@@ ating the under@@ age .
to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent out 6,@@ 880 and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency agreed that the person &quot; might be 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests will only be carried out in cases where the person &apos;s age is asked .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are durable over the past months .
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are rather constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases where the person was evaluated as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers have lied about its age .
in May , the Agency has published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases , who propose to propose that the sub@@ stan@@ tive person was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ a@@ det out the 5@@ 81 results , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said that it will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , made in x @-@ ray and MRI images of Kni@@ ve joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ska Institute &apos;s endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work encomp@@ asses the assessment of biological maturity of people to see whether they were sooner or later than usually by the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about this , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
jud@@ ging the biological age in this way , is very uncertain .
if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do so as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to assess a child as an adult , is low .
the greatest risk is in this case , if the person is under 18 , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the Plan
works on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ra@@ mberg are well ahead .
on Wednesday a seven tons of concrete concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going to be super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Buil@@ ders at the Department of Road and Transport in the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Freiburg .
at the same time , work began at all three renov@@ ating bridges between Sch@@ ra@@ mberg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and is sure that the timet@@ able is kept .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , runs through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a arch @-@ bow bridge of concrete , which is lined with a red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , they now have come into the years .
in order to ensure the stability and road safety , the three buildings are thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead to the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1,@@ 30 metre wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge folder on Wednesday morning .
this is an attachment , which is also used as a run road .
the southern part of the bridge will be set up a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge folder on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way should be gone .
the particular thing is that it is about finishing components , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger firm Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented frac@@ tures .
special finger@@ tips have required the laying of lines through the works in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass fibre cable where many companies are connected .
the indigenous people were informed of the project in advance by hand@@ outs .
also , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be cra@@ cked down .
for the bridges between the Bau@@ hof@@ haus and the collection in direction Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , traffic jams is regulated by a traffic light .
for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher &apos;s entrance is the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; fully locked .
the cost of the three frac@@ tures amounts to 700 000 Euro .
it is funded by the country .
AF@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ lower protest at German potato salad
it is not so common that parties move to a strand , but when it comes to the alternative to Germany ( AF@@ D ) , comes together , which is otherwise difficult to bring into a hat .
the Parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully that day , because the AF@@ D invites a large election campaign in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell as a poster &quot; great election campaign . &quot;
and the famous name to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who , together with Alexander Gau@@ ck , is the top duo for the general election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the AF@@ D students , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the city pic@@ nic was originally planned on the motto &quot; Show more on a table &quot; on the well place , but now take place on the parking below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AF@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , the chairman of the forum A world and one of the alleged organis@@ ers were really happy : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; ur@@ German potato salad , which could also eat the AF@@ D , &quot; says the woman who has brought him .
the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence above all at the station , which is just a few metres from the venues .
how did the AF@@ D come on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes are reported by AF@@ D volcanoes , he endeav@@ oured to stri@@ ve for such an event and get the surcharge .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked for the first time in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built foli@@ age church there was not enough parking available .
so now the f@@ ond@@ ell , homogen@@ ous is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
overlooking the event , he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peac@@ efully . &quot;
it also does : at 20 o &apos;clock the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle , several speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ alz @-@ president Uwe Boy .
in the hall , about 200 listen@@ ers are waiting for this , that the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k hold her speeches .
the police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
something more than an hour takes the AF@@ D event , guests at the advance have a longer breath , but also there is also short after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can drop off - no special inci@@ dents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
a re @-@ stop with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is there in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ ster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 20 o &apos;clock in the conv@@ ent church .

Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese , and they will eat him to the end of their life .
but I want to try everything , Kri@@ sten Stewart openly about her bis@@ ex@@ ality .
&quot; when I joined the cheese once , I think : &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; .
probably the most famous relationship of Hollywood star was the story of her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , who finally came out bitter .
despite all , the brunette Dar@@ stell@@ erin is insured opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone I did .
or do you think about it , I would have played it ? &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten said that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I always lived and believed the du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or ob@@ struc@@ ted me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I only didn &apos;t like it to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially among them I suffered , according to &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in the school time , as they rather disgu@@ ised as a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me , I would look like a Bu@@ b .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and humili@@ ated .
now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of yourself ! &apos; .
especially the public would not love their love life : &quot; people expect that you are in a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me to be ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify the public before the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Virginia Governor of Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump to change his party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayer and much thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a great announcement in the West Virginia Rallye .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice not endor@@ sed the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton .
Justice , who is , according to Forbes , is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes states that he owns coal mines in five states , and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republican National Committee passed on Thursday evening a statement in which it said : &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a democratic party that would rather hin@@ der us to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 gover@@ ness and control of the f@@ ew@@ est bodies in history is the announcement of Governor Justice , only the last re@@ jection of a party , which is from top to bottom without lead and not able to find a positive , reason@@ ably positive message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ President R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel said in an explanation to the C@@ BS News .
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for d@@ oping sc@@ andal
the world @-@ wide boss of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday , what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in the sport .
Russian athle@@ tics boss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics world championships , that the ban of his country was correct , and that he decided to fight the d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who were pushed out at the competition gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress set up for maintaining the prohi@@ bitions that occurred in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) comments on state @-@ sponsored D@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IA@@ AF President Co@@ e said the rep@@ orters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress was delighted that the Russian Federation has experienced in itself , that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia would accept the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force , that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the wi@@ thered system , &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will begin with the Athle@@ tics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London after the strict IA@@ AF criteria than neutral actors .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to fulfill some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting .
drug tests are still in@@ sufficient and forbidden coach . still free , he said rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
tragedy in Mali ab@@ orted to Mali
at a funeral party at the North @-@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar , some 1000 people have thought about 1000 people in a helicopter crash of Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday at the Dom@@ stadt under high safety precau@@ tions .
to un@@ clari@@ fied tow@@ ing , Defence Minister Ursula from the Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
they called the two inver@@ ters pilots but as &quot; C@@ ould of their specialty . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old rod @-@ cat@@ er@@ man from Nord@@ h@@ essen had come to life on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a death @-@ guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
at noon only the relatives accepted in the church .
after that started the funeral in the district of family , eng@@ aging friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr , and politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general insp@@ ect of the German army Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
Trau@@ erg@@ ä@@ ste tended roses , and the people stood by arm in arm to the coff@@ ins .
before the Church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
the minister of defence of the Ley@@ en described the controversial soldiers as &quot; high decorated &quot; and collapsed .
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann has built the air @-@ run business helicopter in Frit@@ z@@ ev@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regim@@ ents .
even Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the Regim@@ ent , declared to which the soldiers said , &quot; If this occupation could not waste the crash , no one would have failed . &quot;
a doubt about the UN Mission in Mali , the Minister of Ley@@ en does not show : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high significance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country , separated from which we are separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the sc@@ orn from the cathedral were brought .
when and where they are being best@@ owed , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a tomb next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , wants to be buried after his death next to his wife .
that divided the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish monarchy is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already carried a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agree with her husband &apos;s decision , it was further reported in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik was buried , is still un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to contribute to his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a H@@ ehl that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have become King .
in 2016 he retired and puts the title &quot; Yo@@ unger . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted to see himself not as equivalent to his wife - even not after death , said L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief spokes@@ woman of the Danish monarchy .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to contribute to his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
a native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristoc@@ ra@@ tic , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik , Prince Hen@@ rik , had a heavy stand in his almost 50 years of re@@ union with the Danish .
in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik said about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did , was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was pregnant , I preferred wine rather than beer , Sil@@ k stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itted , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco , which allowed the reputation to be the brand to be a critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I couldn &apos;t hope for a look .
I was different .
I was happy to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were the same two mistakes ! &quot;
Premier Weil wants a rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP from possible majority in Lower Saxony
the Lower Saxony Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is decre@@ asing after losing the red @-@ green government for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to re@@ sign .
because the Parliament &apos;s dis@@ solution was on Friday .
previously , the surprising exit of a Green Party in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the official appointment of the country code , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover lost their scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green Party of El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jack@@ ed its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hannover .
CD@@ U @-@ Leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ou@@ ler wants to recommend it to his group to record them .
thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the lower @-@ Sax@@ on land day , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship was vice versa .
the new day will be on the 14th January of this year .
Th@@ eb@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government has to decide whether they could continue to rain in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil keeps , however , is still vital that the Land@@ tag decides to decide quickly his self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on Tuesday on Tuesday .
the state constitution also sees the opportunity that Prime Minister the Prime Minister draws the trust and cho@@ oses his successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
these possibilities must be insp@@ ected properly , &quot; said Th@@ ick@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions , if they are legally checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ eb@@ ler called the West &apos;s step &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the politicians in itself stressed : &quot; I am not a gu@@ ardian .
I feel very good . &quot;
they referred to as a trailer from black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the back@@ sliding members for the return of their Land@@ tag@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we think of course , that she has received their Land@@ tag , which she has received over the green state list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distributed the national president Meta Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Group President of the Green An@@ ja PI@@ EL said : &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets extra@@ ordin@@ arily . &quot;
she deliberately decided to guide no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the faction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background , there was no content in content , we cannot compreh@@ end this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the over@@ coming of the Sax@@ on Green Party El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behavior of the former Green Party in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bund@@ esch@@ ef &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re @-@ elect the Land@@ tag quickly .
the outlet T@@ west@@ l costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political leaders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her last vanity and their personal interests in front of the well @-@ being of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to beat the political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
low @-@ point CD@@ U @-@ leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ou@@ ler wants to recommend his M@@ EPs to record El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets into the CD@@ U .
the President of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed the life@@ jack@@ ets to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the 2013 country code .
the CD@@ U was the strongest power , SPD and Green at the time of the SPD , but a very thin majority of a voice .
agricultural ministers in the interview - How do we protect us from tox@@ ins , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses the contam@@ inated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal pass ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) stands in an interview with the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt : how can the consumer protect itself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer and consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the st@@ amping pres@@ sures .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states present the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , after all , we are currently aware of a health condition is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Economics ?
the food surveillance is the role of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has broken off immediately , and since the announcement of the failure of Germany in the close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk evaluation are available for consumers .
trade has the same as the manufacturers concern that the selling products are portable and health un@@ think@@ able .
if at eggs the resi@@ dual content of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , they are not market@@ able .
Un@@ polluted eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time the companies are not to blame .
are production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the knowledge of knowledge , production plants does not meet immediate debt .
rather , they must expect economic damage due to presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies .
as usual , there is too little control in the harvest .
is it missing only on the personnel or also the outside jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls , which have uncovered the process .
however , the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded as 100 percent .
just therefore , a consistent policy of such events and the transfer to the public bar in the cases where crimes can be prepared , of crucial importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made several times clearly that I expect from the responsible authorities a l@@ ut@@ less explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular alarm dy@@ mus really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get safe and secure food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ tici@@ de is used in the food industry , consumer and consumer are too righ@@ ted .
producers , tra@@ ders and consumers are advised to get into a situation which is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ tici@@ des Fi@@ bra@@ il in post@@ ure life @-@ service animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately .
it has to be consistent and worked with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the atomic fact is growing and rec@@ lam@@ ent .
how the rules of the football rules on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered issues of the European football matches will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
some consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA still , as the leading organization that has supervised the European game is to offer teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair Play rules that have been launched in 2011 by UEFA in 2011 means that PS@@ G has to point out that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without large losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( $ 262 million ) to buy Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can make sure the money go loose with confidence in order to bring N@@ ey@@ mar to bring him into a galaxy other stars , faced by the funding of the team by the energy rich Herr@@ scher@@ Family of Qatar .
clubs may apply much money for the acqu@@ iring players , but they have to deal with legitimate guarantees of income , which allow them to enable the break @-@ even point in their to the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P has been designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007 .
the ex @-@ French player thought that clubs that had received enormous debts after success in their quest , effectively dec@@ ei@@ ving and risk to ruin , if banks or owner with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P reli@@ es on concent@@ rating on the liabilities of clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , Roman Abra@@ mo@@ vich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - a club with potential bought and then invested heavily , to build the crew and build a global brand - to a tough@@ er matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P reference period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of EUR 30 million .
and even though Plat@@ ini is fallen by the Presi@@ dency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to put away from excessive expenses .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we are destined to rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; Andrea Tra@@ vert@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , opposite The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week .
although PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for the invoice about the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract for the next five years , amounting to € 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has met the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
PS@@ G has been awarded a fine of 60 million euros ( at the time of 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the teams for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will take place on 21 players instead of normal 25 players .
the UEFA is in search of clubs that could try to over@@ lists their financial income by providing their income through companies that are connected with owners of a club .
while the global company could transp@@ onder@@ s PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should not exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA has won &apos;t be considered legitimate income .
it was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the s@@ s of PSA by the Qatar Tourism Authority was pu@@ ffed .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could be based on payments of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have fought that N@@ ey@@ mar World Championship will be am@@ bass@@ adors just to find out a rich maneu@@ ver for the UEFA regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA will be more attentive , to observe each attempt to b@@ ypass the rules .
the UEFA had no pre @-@ prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G over N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they said under the condition of An@@ ony@@ m@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they weren &apos;t authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of € 54@@ 2.4 million in revenues of more than € 10 million .
accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrive a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot .
the Association assumes that revenue after signing by at least 30 percent will rise .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best foot@@ ball@@ ers , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s . by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financi@@ ally D@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars last owner of PS@@ G .
Arsenal @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state that is financing a club .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has changed complete the entire landscape of the football in the last 15 years , &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday .
&quot; once a country owns a club , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial fair Fair@@ play because you can get different ways or different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new sound supplier

industry insi@@ der estimate the volume of orders according to the North West Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros @-@ based company achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .

how many applicants is on the new call , Swiss will not want to betra@@ y Swiss .
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
according to the newspaper report , Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort for renewal of the contract across the spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not re@@ achable for a position .

this re@@ petition of history is simultaneously nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ person years , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ years Gr@@ unge era ( as the pioneer David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ age ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to larger things .

it is the moments of acci@@ dental mad@@ ness that could heat this franchise as a type of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until it reaches what I will show as its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene the band will show how to visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; in the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even on &quot; G@@ low &quot; with his East @-@ against @-@ West Ring@@ fight I@@ con@@ ography .
the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka , a comedy with R@@ hy@@ s Thomas : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who are fighting for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the lead roles - a hard @-@ powered Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt to be synchron@@ ized in English .
it &apos;s a genius idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful G@@ ags to look at ( the police bring the time to view chess on television as Americans may do with football ) .
and the list of the famous spokes@@ man - among them Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent play &apos; Fin@@ de the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer that carries a Reagan mask , is included - often as a single one .
with six long episodes , it turns off , and the comedy is not fast or frequently enough .
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which has been edited on a smaller length , could only deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ sati@@ re , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef once again attend the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who devour a he@@ ap of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ ined communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for the age of money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with the ih@@ ist@@ y .
blow against drugs m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police managed a blow against the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning the Black Forest district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Con@@ stance , Esslingen and Stuttgart have searched numerous objects , as the public prosecutor &apos;s office took hold on Friday .
between the ages of 25 and 77 , 15 years were arrested and already arrest war@@ rants were issued against them .
in addition , the officials appointed greater amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand Euros .
at the same Raz@@ or in Italy two people were arrested .
there were German arrest war@@ rants against the two susp@@ ects .
they are therefore expected to be delivered to Germany .
the action was involved in Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators .
in total , over 300 polic@@ emen were employed .
the Mafia members of the m@@ af@@ ia is accused of drug criminal , heavy violence , attempted murder and rob@@ ber@@ y .
already since summer 2016 the public prosecutor &apos;s office Con@@ stance against organised drugs in the south @-@ German space .
between the State bar in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , a re@@ ger exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
hence the large deployment on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in particular , Italian nationals re@@ united with regard to Italian m@@ af@@ ia , especially Italian citizens .
a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , fired up for several shots in a restaurant in the morning , should go to the gang of bonds .
ways make big g@@ aps in the fore@@ ig@@ ner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not emerge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report , the fore@@ ig@@ ner register indicates significant short@@ com@@ ings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lead to partially gra@@ ding mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
the representative for refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has taken attention to a media report according to large g@@ aps in the country @-@ center register .
short@@ com@@ ings of the registered data may result in case of asylum procedures and devi@@ ations &quot; by part serious mis@@ decisions , &quot; warned in an analysis that is presented by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the regi@@ sters , there are about ten million people with foreign nationals , including approximately 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore administr@@ ated by about 600 exclusion authorities in Germany .
because the data was not sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts have not been well maintained .
in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who are long no longer in life , or of citizens who have become German citizens and actually no longer should emerge in the register . &quot;
&quot; faulty data input can significantly slow down process processes , &quot; it is called the report .
in statistics of more than traveling people , EU citizens are captured , which would not have to travel .
such in@@ correct provisions , however , led to a dist@@ orted debate on dealing with trav@@ ellers &quot; means , therefore , in the analysis .
meanwhile , the federal government has apparently began to return refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children back to Italy when they arrived from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper it means that B@@ AM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site .
according to the Dublin agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees to reach the EU .
if a mig@@ rant travels into another EU country , this state can send him back to the immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the reason , the office is now writing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the recording capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy have submitted for inclusion and accommodation of families guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) hold this commitment to sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
the internal policy spokesperson for the decision in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children dro@@ pping because of def@@ ici@@ encies in the Italian asylum system of human rights conditions and a endanger@@ ing of childhood . &quot;
second result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living persons were already available for other people .

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and we@@ aker of inflation have w@@ asted the spec@@ ulation over an increase .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; income when interest rates interest rates in the middle of an intensi@@ fied pressure .
the Bank &apos;s policy makers ( M@@ PC ) voted for 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 % , with less members a rise in this month as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for increasing .
in its quarterly GDP report the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and expected to continue by 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that inflation would continue to rise to almost 3 % in autumn .
but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest rate would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation of Bre@@ xit , and she said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected to financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the Mamm@@ ut stimul@@ us package that was issued a year after a Bre@@ xit .
it will demand time for the financial plan to provide competitive financial resources for banks , even though it was said that they will be able to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , because pressure on the re@@ inst@@ alls is still bur@@ dened by consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to interest rates , they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is required for cooling down inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slightly larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent , than the markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently projected the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
the Bank therefore empha@@ sized that increases are &quot; gradually &quot; and &quot; limits . &quot;
the Bank forecast down@@ wards for this year &apos;s growth forecast down@@ wards to 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to this news from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the most recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth pay the increasing expectations on a interest rate impact and GDP growth in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has risen to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to grow at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the Bank at the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by increasing inflation and low @-@ level cases , because it becomes worse before they will be better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preventing income &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they added that wages at the end of their three @-@ year period will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recover &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pounds , which is compens@@ ated to a portion of the lower consumer expenditure .
the decision coming to a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking European vote which caused the sin@@ ks of the P@@ fun@@ des .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will complete the prices and economy .
prior to the final judgment of the bank on the interest rates , the reputation was increased after a interest rate , as inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision makers in July expected a rise to 0.5 % in July .
inflation has fallen below 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % last month , although the Bank said that this was expected to come back in the coming months .
the Bank said that , in proportion to their goal of 2 % , the Bank said that it is over to the weak Po@@ unds .
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the shortest response of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market should be stronger once more competitive , as the borrow@@ er would look very strongly to businesses and end the year in positive manner .
the market is particularly good for those who run the existing De@@ als and close the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prop@@ el the most controversial HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people
from September after a battle before the High Court against financing the drug in N@@ HS access to a &quot; trans@@ forming &quot; HIV prevention treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that one prior to sexual intercourse recorded the pre@@ ex@@ position of pre@@ ex@@ positions ( Pr@@ EP ) which can decrease the risk of infection at high risk patients by around 86 percent , now by health service over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he declared himself willing to fund the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a verdict of the Supreme Court in the past year , according to the N@@ HS , despite the claim that local authorities should pay him .
the check@@ out announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon Stev@@ ens , as &quot; important new intervention &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be first belonging to the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
Pre@@ ex@@ position@@ sp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xe ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV preparation that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection .
to take Pr@@ EP in front of intercourse means that just enough medications in the body are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come to the treatment , gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , tran@@ ss@@ ex@@ ual and persons with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and registered at a house specialist can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex @-@ clinic .
the program will receive £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of medicines in this week after an international competitive pro@@ curement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of Pr@@ EP by adju@@ sting clinical evidence as it is used in a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these great new intervention should have the extensive and increasingly successful efforts to complement and over@@ take HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in managing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive Committee at the NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , when targeted and endangered people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV pan@@ de@@ mic .
from September to become people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and not with a negoti@@ ation by a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many life@@ times .
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority now indicates that the study will quickly be carried out throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV .
now , since the Pr@@ EP @-@ Test@@ ed medicine was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
Sharon Hodg@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; the start of the Pr@@ EP trial is welcome and over@@ due after months delay and hes@@ itation by the government .
the evidence shows how trans@@ former this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV @-@ prevention and ending the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible in the whole country to protect people that are HIV infected , and that they contribute to the end of ending HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
living in life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ sted in 2014 by a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne does not packed her bags and sold .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a lot of larger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made a special offer on this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a covered layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous deck height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed von Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to create 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home , which was not only a place , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge of it was to create a mezzanine which one could stand in .
Er@@ fan had to be creative thinking to resolve the award .
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked together , without g@@ aps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not just about building a simple platform , but put the steel so that it had the right height above or below the right height . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper window of ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us can look down via the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
donated gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting put the style for the program .
using spi@@ ders plays a role when adding theatres , space and light .
on both ends a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to make it longer .
in the kitchen , the reflection feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance de@@ vised units place for all the a@@ isle and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous smoke , the beauty of the living room can exclu@@ de the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special feature is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little engineering of engineering went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel strengthened , ven@@ eer @-@ door @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important , so that if you move the door to the door , it is very easy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage room , Jo@@ anne could win additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land surface - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; Er@@ fan says .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agents will enter and carry out a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
here , they have managed to increase the floor space and use high @-@ quality materials , which give space to its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and that are therefore helping to create an emotional ties in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t love yourself in electrical outlets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that a flat can be transformed by a good design and increased square meters of slightly standard@@ ly into something completely new .
indeed , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this .
brothers struggle for a 500 million US dollar real estate .
two brothers have four decades after their Italian family founded the Dynastie , in a meditation on one of the biggest real estate of Vict@@ ori@@ as , worth over 500 million dollars .
former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developers Colin De Lu@@ tis live in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and their business will be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp confron@@ tation over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co jeans family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and the De Lu@@ tis portfolio includes offices in urban area , the development areas of Bruns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the subur@@ b .
after an agreement with her late father Colin has written Colin - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s business and Paul about one third .
a court states that Colin &apos;s property valued at a value of $ 316 million and Paul is worth a value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has been proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaving of Colin presented him with the left , which I kept for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in the first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed attempts , the Supreme Court of Justice took place last Friday .
the brothers also struggle for control over the existing business - from what Colin , as Paul claims to have been excluded .
Colin argued that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some owners .
in an early affair that was submitted by Colin , he says he hope to settle the dispute .
&quot; my Italian inheritance writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the cost will rise in the event , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides of the Bar Association .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen , from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a business in Bruns@@ wick .
you used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Property , in which Colin opened the first Je@@ ans@@ charge of the family .
Colin says that he began to go to West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of High School when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land on the court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are not part of the De Lu@@ tis group group , with Colin claimed that Mark were paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Luke , as well as Mark , Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin made himself very back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 by Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case is in front of the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our family name through the dishes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Colin wrote a letter to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end in our present dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he is still looking for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Colin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps of new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the pre@@ ten@@ ment of the pre@@ sidents .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new staff of the White House plans to limit the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece of reporter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
when John F. Kelly , who met new staff of Staff of the White House , on his first working day with executive employees , he portra@@ yed a major problem in president Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he wants to repair : poor information that got into the hands of the president .
Kelly said the staff that information should flow on him - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring its media grounds .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship with television lasts for decades - and now , where he is at the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Tr@@ ump had anno@@ yed because of an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to convince him that he had received a fair coverage of places that were to convince &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to POL@@ IT@@ ICO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep the tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it under control , according to six former election campaign officers to ensure that his personal media consumption has a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it ever &quot; was &quot; under control , &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps this campaign officials know something that we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets would have not contain any additional ignition material without their interventions .
we &apos;ll probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump does not broadcast .
if his staff had given him some times , trouble away from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has to prevent it consistently that Tr@@ ump controversy ev@@ okes .
a part of the problem is that people put together in a White House that sets itself out of competing parties , always trying to present their own agenda by presenting the tr@@ ump material that might help their views from the world .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of consultants , President of strategic reasons and desper@@ ate information .
this was an example described by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ makers :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press excer@@ pts , especially those with dam@@ aging le@@ aks , and that he may find out where these originate from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly that happened at the end of February when somebody un@@ will@@ ed a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of &quot; in the White House . &quot;
although Johnson was banned because of Sch@@ ic@@ ans permanently from Twitter , or that he had offered no concrete evidence , or that it expressed false alleg@@ ations in the past and has resi@@ sted them .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ makers added that the staff of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage paper and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still stri@@ ve to influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
Mei@@ st@@ wanted criminals get post by Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the aid of the people will pray and hoped .
the police in all of Europe shipped this summer ( virtual ) postcards on dangerous criminals on the run .
since the addresses of the searched for heavy criminals are not known , hin@@ ts from the population hopes and worship .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the action that follows &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; Adv@@ ent calendar from winter .
the experiences have shown that many flee to holiday destinations hide it by Euro@@ pol .
I have compiled 21 postcards on selected criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ i &apos;s website has been viewed , more than 2.5 million times this time has been viewed .
36 of the online @-@ searched were so far been arrested , at least eleven of them due to the publication on the website .
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined trav@@ ellers on the foot of war , which have tra@@ ded away from the municipality , to demand a field in front of their men &apos;s houses .
travelers have par@@ ked their 20 caravan on a field outside a weal@@ thy street by Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire series . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of tran@@ sports , after being thrown out in May , without being shot down from the Council of buried gra@@ bs to prevent their accidents .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense systems and pressed its vehicles by a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
angry inhabitants have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said , &quot; They are on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley Heath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers .
the Council must be forced to implement in fact , as he was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem .
the trav@@ ellers were there in May , and moved back now .
yesterday evening an evening , probably still more . &quot;
they added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to make it possible by keeping long brief@@ ings to protect their parks .
I w@@ rest@@ less on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay for my first thing if the Council cannot stop it once . &quot;
a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of this trav@@ eler , just to be lo@@ oted from another round .
the numbers have increased this time and has even seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesperson for the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorized camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and working with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as far as many residents report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check when we advance our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts are currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
with closure of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then ambi@@ ence of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at 13 April 2014 , approximately 30 000 nights per year were lost and revenue through the local tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of the numbers of refugees who came to the county , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but above all , the mayor of the mayor of Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the property location and already spoke of serious applicants in the house at the time .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has purchased the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Hon@@ al@@ b .
you will welcome you Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof there have been a length of Bau@@ sch@@ utt@@ les at the entrance where you enter the house , and when you enter the house , a vast renovation work will be performed .
the floors have been torn out , ceilings to the part , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a beautiful hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large @-@ walk showers , the entrance to the entrance is switched and new windows are installed .
everything was &quot; nice &quot; close to &quot; how Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses himself .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room are among the facilities .
you shouldn &apos;t be positioned at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but it &apos;s already on a high @-@ level downtown level , too .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise offering its approximately 60 rooms to be spreading , explains Sch@@ erer further .
groups , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he already led talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Krau@@ se he already led .
the performances of the city are covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the level of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants to define exactly exactly .
scar@@ c@@ ely under a million euros , he expects .
the external plants are also brought forward to fore@@ man , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant that is open to public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia &apos;s Aff@@ air : U.S. Special En@@ ters The Grand Jury
in Russia &apos;s affair , US president Donald Tr@@ ump is supposed to have started a special Jury by Robert Mu@@ eller after a report called Grand Jury .
the panel recorded the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under appeal to the matter .
the newspaper cle@@ ars the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the CNN reported that there are already pre @-@ charges of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian attor@@ ney .
U.S. intelligence acc@@ uses the Kre@@ m@@ lin to have targeted targeted targeted in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were demo@@ lition between Tr@@ uman election campaign team and Moscow .
in the focus of investigations , several men should stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to report , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope .
the Washington Post , &quot; wrote a couple of weeks ago that the special medi@@ ator Tr@@ ump personally sent to the center and under@@ go the accus@@ ation , if the president may have hin@@ dered justice in the wake of the affair .
the main task of Grand jur@@ ys is to examine and decide evidence in possible accidents and decide whether charges should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys will therefore also be called arbitr@@ ary chambers .
they are mostly switched on if it is larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always closed behind closed doors .
the panel can also be switched on by the Prosec@@ ution to invite people to interro@@ g@@ ation under oath .
according to the transmitter CNN , pre @-@ charges have already been issued to turn the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian attor@@ ney .
persons who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also Tr@@ um@@ ps consultant and son @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ aging election campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort with the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in U.S. TV , that the suspension will show that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that he should be necessary quickly to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment .
nevertheless , for the opening of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening was a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia @-@ affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the subject give the Democrats a way to feel &quot; well , &quot; because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement , he knew nothing of the en@@ forcement of a Grand Jury .
these work , however , usually work in secret , he empha@@ sized .
the White House fears all measures that accelerated the work of the Sonder@@ kom@@ er in &quot; f@@ aire &quot; way .
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that not to be determined against the president .
you have no reason to assume that something changed , it was further stated in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump com@@ ey had fired .
because of this rap@@ proch@@ ement , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become loud , he tried to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to investigate the investigations against the then national security adviser , Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the President is under a large pressure because of the investigation .
after portra@@ yal of US media , the White House gathered material against the special medi@@ ator and its employees .
this solved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wants to be released .
unlike a independent special medi@@ ator in the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , the president of Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller , gave a position in which he could be fired on den@@ ces by the President of the Ministry of Justice in theory .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step forward .
two groups of Republican and democratic sen@@ ators identified the Thursday draft on Thursday , after which the special medi@@ ator could not be put away so simply .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ice@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the Western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ice@@ berg has loos@@ ened from the nearly seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ lei@@ s .
the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institut for Polar@@ - and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the more than one trillion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres of large Kol@@ oss throw now to the north and will probably take two , three years until it melted .
it is one of the biggest Iron Maiden in the past three decades , with 175 kilometers length and a width of up to 50 kilometers .
there is no danger to humans .
as a consequence of climate change , climate change played a role in the demo@@ lition of the ice@@ berg , according to research data is un@@ clear .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual con@@ tours in the region for around 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a fac@@ simile background .
in the opinion of many researchers , it could be related to global warming .
the now broken Kol@@ oss was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ lei@@ s so far .
Sch@@ el@@ lei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by great gl@@ aciers .
it continues to grow further into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hüt@@ te is situated south of South America , almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this el@@ fe@@ el@@ isk , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rup@@ ture was disturbed some years ago .
a complete towel will fall there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ lei@@ s are in danger , because the front edge had never been withdrawn as far as currently .
in addition , the ice plate also stands under tension and can fall , if at a key point a piece is ab@@ orted .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ lei@@ s and ice@@ berg not increase the sea level as they swim out on the water and pushed ice as much water as it comes after the melting itself .
however , the loss of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ ises leads to the gl@@ aciers directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
it could possibly increase sea level , but only in a small degree , the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
after A@@ WI @-@ C , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ lei@@ s is the fourth largest sh@@ uts of Antar@@ c@@ tica after A@@ WI .
on the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , on the front edge to the open ocean some 200 metres .
there breaks it regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is a natural creature and no direct connection to climate change is aware , the iron sign is now in a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most extensive retreat since the start of the record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under scientists , it is controversial whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ celebrate again grow or return in the long term , and possibly coinci@@ dentally , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even though these researchers do not return the ab@@ rup@@ ture of this gigantic ice@@ berg , in recent decades , however , many ir@@ c@@ ud@@ dle of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been de@@ pl@@ agu@@ ed by the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
this long zi@@ pper of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice area of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the temperature increase has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has been war@@ med around three degrees over the past 50 years and t@@ ame them in the areas where the temperature is fastest growing .
CD@@ U wants to crew the staff at personnel
because it is becoming more difficult to fill @-@ in positions , the CD@@ U calls out to be more attractive to the employers association to be more attractive .
just before the summer break , the chal@@ k day has seen 41 new places in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials work for the administration management in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 tra@@ inees have left their first working day behind .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very sought .
in this year , some 620 applications were to be recorded for this year .
nevertheless , the circle is further missing to tackle the increased requirements and tasks .
at present , there are currently 50 un@@ occupied positions at the district M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to take part in the C@@ ret@@ um together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG course and compete with the skilled workers in the administration .
according to the request of the parties , the administration is to have a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term demand for professionals , but to counter @-@ proof of the candidates .
the overall concept should look inside and out@@ war@@ dly , specific measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include an educational campaign , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds already after a good approach .
because the circle has it to do with personnel problems , which one could not know earlier .
other cities adver@@ tise good officials and employees and provide more attractive terms .
the speech is given by a real &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
for this purpose , a high number of employees , disease , or age reasons came out of service .
so the highest time for action , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Nations , leader of the CD@@ U , continues his party with his party .
he has long been in the delivery day for a f@@ ex@@ y surprise when he publicly posed the recruitment coverage publicly in question and the rest of the parties failed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want to be checked out all possibilities that allow an exit from the communist employers association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are not coming to a satisfactory solution here , the administration of administration with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated cities - tend to stri@@ ve for a ho@@ ur@@ istic rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials , when the tariff of tariff for the public service is actually fore@@ seen .
the sal@@ aries are currently pre @-@ written , enh@@ ancing increases or more money , if you are going to be higher in a higher level , which orient@@ ates themselves at professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown increasingly in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute law .
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Coun@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ au Martin judge have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy intensi@@ fies the tone of NGO @-@ Mig@@ rants life@@ jack@@ ets
Italy has NGOs who use rescue boats for mig@@ rant workers in the Mediterranean , warned that they do not continue to continue their operations in new rules .
&quot; if NGOs haven &apos;t signed a new code index , it &apos;s difficult to see how they can work , &quot; said Interior Marco Min@@ nit@@ i , in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa .
Min@@ ni@@ tis War@@ ning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Res@@ et &apos; , because their crew had effectively collabor@@ ated with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facil@@ itated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year since a year , refused to express their detailed predi@@ ctions of the Italian business@@ man Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of the human life is our top priority . so we are sorry that we can &apos;t operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in a statement about the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge any accus@@ ations that are currently collected , only after having collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth Res@@ et &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is assumed that its crew of rub@@ ber@@ y will be delivered on board , which can be delivered directly by human hands , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acquisition of the public prosecutor , which was published by Italian media .
the occupation is susp@@ icious , on the authority of Italian coast @-@ guards who monitors rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of code , boats like I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer on board having supervised its activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have been declared ready to keep itself in the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered un@@ necessarily , but they would not be acceptable , because they would not bring a significant changes or disability &quot; their rescue operation .
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organisation Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ nit@@ i said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy have declined sharply in recent weeks , in recent weeks that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast @-@ guards and the collaboration with local citizens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
An@@ sti@@ ege and Tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bik@@ ers , the &quot; Berlin Foreign posts &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days of tri@@ bal and tourist attractions .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley turned out to be a good starting point for tours .
the Castle and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour carried along hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ ab@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
the view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the pre @-@ bearing levels .
in between there has always been longer att@@ endants , for the long tri@@ b@@ als to be rewarded .
on the second day , it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the popular litter market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , look@@ out point to the view@@ point , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flo@@ ge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate clim@@ bs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days , many ups were told .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and cat@@ ches kept welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers in the open @-@ free inhal@@ ing age is healing .
also Neu@@ stadt was controlled .
after 173 kilometres and nearly 4500 altitude metres , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest from its best side - sporty and cul@@ tur@@ ally .
console instead of grass - Bundesliga equi@@ ps for e @-@ sport
are the sports stars in future sit ahead of computer consol@@ es , instead of strug@@ gling with wind and weather over the stadium r@@ v@@ ens ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cra@@ tive business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high G@@ ages .
this also recognised the first federal govern@@ aver@@ a that increasingly eng@@ ages in this area .
at the beginning of 2015 V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire the new young target groups for V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says President Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that on this move there will have a rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Cup Football World Cup organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; at which gam@@ ers compete in various clubs .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt &apos;s great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has now been an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real soccer must deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people also go into the stadium , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : they tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could be present far more often on these markets , than just once in the year the Federal Reserve to Asia .
why is it exactly ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; during the E @-@ Sport computer games like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even the soccer simulation of FIFA on competitive edge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as in normal sport , Li@@ gen has long been established , in which pros had to compete against each other .
and in the Asia Pacific , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a right sport ?
for many , the performance is certainly ordinary .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber has long been dealt with the question .
for the professor at the German Sport@@ s- University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is com@@ peti@@ tive and many biological and physical reactions show that you can also find in classic sport - for example , increased heart rate , stress reaction , hormon@@ al changes .
besides , there are cog@@ nitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and fast response skills .
professional gam@@ ers should not only train at the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention .
&quot; the last player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but also problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ oping is always a subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult in online games , and in the scene failed the structures of classical sports .
the scientists highlights the high Integ@@ rative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
the players are on the way internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural shirts .
a study by the management consulting firm Del@@ o@@ itte , and the Bundes@@ verband Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts an exciting growth ahead of the e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , more than 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments .
in three years , sales should be 130 million .
against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga , it is little .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Del@@ o@@ itte Advisor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many countries already .
great markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodriguez at the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports participate .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the professional sports competition Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as teaching , F@@ rob@@ ber says .
in the Netherlands and in France the soccer @-@ first league @-@ criminals is oblig@@ ated to al@@ ign a e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany comes back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Management Board of R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nostal@@ gia to fall and to clari@@ fy the ancient times , today is no longer enough .
it is therefore , to preserve the tradition of the association , but to al@@ ign the company at the same time .
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; also D@@ utt &apos;s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t hold that only when football remains so as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Carter was condemned on 13 July 2014 , because of the beaten murder of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until the appeal .
she was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argued that both they and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red tro@@ users and a creamy bl@@ ouse , Carter found out with tears in the eyes , folded and down@@ ward eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosecutor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she had no responsibility taken over , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ters said attor@@ ney , it was a &quot; terrible change that they utterly regret . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , he did not find that her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity or even their mental disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a public prosecutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said that &quot; there is no day in which I don &apos;t get the loss of my beloved Son .
I want that he is proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain , which we will be wearing for eternity with us , for his sisters there is to be there .
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy said that she will be &quot; persecuted by the realisation , &quot; that she will never be able to participate in the wedding of her brother or a aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more this single person , with whom I was together since I was born every day , is a pain I kept alive for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to set a righ@@ tly preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime that calls for another to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy found dead of carbohydr@@ ate pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case with@@ drew national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encour@@ ages him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go on , spring from a building , buy yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the eyes of his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Everything that you must do is to en@@ force the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from any press from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
to the few who defended Carter , Amanda Fort Knox , who was convicted in 2007 for murder of her British co @-@ resident in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago .
Mrs. Knox , &apos; 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter ear@@ ns compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ i : learn from the new Mini @-@ L@@ acqu@@ er of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run the Audi Cup as captain , no coincidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a great season - extra motivation did not fail .
something was different from his place in the cabin , that Joshua watched me immediately if the additional clothes piece was very , very small .
but as far as far and broad@@ ly on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course there was no Philipp L@@ ame and also no Manuel New to see him , he made him bar@@ k to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner after his first deployment as Bavaria @-@ Kapitän . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the one could have better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i was able to interpre@@ t the signs of the coach too .
not the eight years old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen in the youth of youth , de@@ but@@ ant , and especially the professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f was chosen as a master guide , but he .
sugar@@ s have a favorite one to those who want a lot to keep you on your mood .
so for those who tried out to take the heritage of L@@ ame , a small extra motivation can only be used .
Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old became a mini @-@ lame on the field .
right behind , that &apos;s now its position , the white bass on the arm did their rest .
and anyway , Kim@@ i worked in this starting information as the one who can take the rest in hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the inv@@ aded tro@@ upe .
he had the look for the whole , while many others were busy with themselves .
Vi@@ dal to achieve his missing fitness ( fol@@ dable , hardly any ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches come out on the services of the Asia journey ( fol@@ dable also only ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus to fall into their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
this nevertheless worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran along with Kim@@ i , Rud@@ y in front of the defense and both were sovereign .
the emin@@ is@@ tical Nap@@ oli storm often did so difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ le tried to make a few times a few times .
his colleague Rud@@ y gave us that the result &quot; was not the way we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a ti@@ dy performance during his debut .
game drives , speed change : &quot; I was also picked up for this style . &quot;
as un@@ familiar , this Bayern world still exists for new@@ com@@ ings , one saw following the game .
Rud@@ y , for example , gave not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i passed after a few more cris@@ p statement in his new te@@ amm@@ ate .
there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting phrase : &quot; what happens here I have already noticed now .
at Bavaria , you just have to win each game . &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new ones .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ alz Minister : business pra@@ ises knowledge pace
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than a year , in which the new business Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T @-@ V request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ dom is attacking the desires of the economy that Lem@@ ke blocked . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around look at Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the L@@ ück@@ er of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the priority list of the country .
this year the ministry is hopes for a planning process , until 2021 the building is meant to be right .
the country &apos;s plans also plays a role in the plans of the country , which stands in the pre @-@ int@@ ru@@ sive demand of the Federal Office .
the aim is to take the track in operation in December 2020 , says Minister @-@ based Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign for regional , but international competing companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) is stimul@@ ated , such as wis@@ sing , at the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to boost sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of growing German wine exports in ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ dom has an open ear for people who want to establish a company , bet@@ ting the I@@ HK .
the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier is presenting an additional incen@@ tive for young tra@@ inees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
the premi@@ ums of € 1000 is intended for the complete master examination and 2500 Euro if graduates within ten years after the championship education is self @-@ employed .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the construction of road construction will quickly create facts , at the same time , the country at the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , chief executive leader of the I@@ HK Trier .
56 new engineers who want to adjust their wis@@ sing in the national operation are only 29 places so far .
the I@@ HK calls for more orders to external offices .
CD@@ U @-@ spokesperson vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the machine , the country investing more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of country roads as proposed .
Frank Nat@@ us is also a concept of the country , as it wants to fix the skilled workers in the region .
sober@@ ing is also the previous broadband building in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated the supply of power in an I@@ HK @-@ survey with the score 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about mol@@ ding Internet connections and out@@ breaks .
ex @-@ economic Secretary Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke to April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where they had already shipped the field after four months of in@@ consisten@@ cies .
Audi is supposed to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are confron@@ ted with a counter@@ reaction .
a day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Group said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is more intelligent options as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constra@@ int &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles to offer or limit them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described companies as a return call .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ itting the diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma .
the cost of automotive manufacturers to install the neutr@@ alisation of exhaust gas vehicles to the neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles , also make it difficult to make the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel was also accused of ignor@@ ing the mighty car companies and ignore signs of the problem .
the companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen to regulate the use of so @-@ called depreciation devices that have been regulated to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested , but back in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were accused of Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean .
last month , the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities have accused Audi to b@@ ypass emissions legislation in Europe , and an inquiry which was focused on the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the study could be heavily polluted by Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes to the pre @-@ proportional gain of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order to join the Is@@ ar visitor , a raft trip through Munich , which has a special message on Saturday morning .
if it goes on Saturday again to the Is@@ ar , there will be a great raft there between Fl@@ au@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ bridge .
and that is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the Bau@@ refer@@ ate wants to clari@@ fy .
on the raft you can see a big inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ ger .
it shows a tr@@ ash berg .
the pre@@ lu@@ de to a public@@ ity campaign to app@@ end the Is@@ ar visitors .
with the motto &quot; True Love &quot; ... the understanding of the is@@ ar is being sharp@@ ened .
last summer , the raft drove over the Is@@ ar and this year there are further promotions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
morph@@ ine dum@@ plings and the laughter against suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the first published Carto@@ on @-@ illustr@@ ator , the b@@ oll@@ ard of his pieces are its trademark .
even with 85 , the Argent@@ ines still stands and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For there is too much sorrow in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he struck with other things as an illustr@@ ator for gambling cards - what was fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when he lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , at the end of the 1960s , the breakthrough came back : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
more and more artists inspired him to be inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures are cav@@ orting in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , he still sits on the drawing table today , continues to work for almost ten hours daily .
over cal@@ endars , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches find his threatened figures continue to spread much spread throughout the world .
he has also been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with its figures for six years .
the main character in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - morph@@ ine any test@@ es animal in his drawings - which has a thou@@ sand@@ ing counter as a counter@@ player .
his figures for the first time speak his figures in the 3D movie , from 2019 to the kin@@ esi@@ ve wall .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they &apos;re saying , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
this is why he has more reli@@ es on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is power@@ less produced .
lavender from Provence from climate change
he became a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the lavender is decl@@ ining because of the conditions of drought , and because of the disease @-@ borne insects , scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , which can try to find great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert on the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the lavender in Provence is effective because the plant in recent years was exposed to the effects of climate change , which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn .
this has effects on the life span of lavender .
there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacteria , the d@@ warf of zi@@ pped , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot in the game .
lavender oil is not just perfect for holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; rather than very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either damaged or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered , a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of the ev@@ ap@@ oration of the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of flav@@ ours that are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .
the town of Ge@@ isa in the Thur@@ ing@@ ian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .

the assassination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the weekly staff of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce meet in Wednesday to review their plans for the reporting on the youngest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ audi@@ ble drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told to them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists are discussing what feels safer : they are supposed to take their kids to the office , which were the goal of an attack with gren@@ ades or to leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a plate at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
you pray the rep@@ orters , names for each column - no evidence is necessary , per@@ cep@@ tions and abdominal feelings rich .
there are drugs ding@@ g@@ gler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the secret list of government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there are no rest of the violence , and while in all the country the cor@@ p@@ ses , there are still more journalists : at least 25 , since President Enrique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under attack and threats from Bundes@@ schutz und until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter you are the editor and her incar@@ ator of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , co @-@ founder of Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence will be deeply felt , even though his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his medieval finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; he hang@@ s on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos; building . two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , with Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez wearing T @-@ shirts , which show his sm@@ elling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ orters are discussing their shared issues , the trau@@ ma , her night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special prosecutor was built in 2010 in order to edit the cases of journalists , this committee , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists , has only initiated two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of murders that are associated with drug traff@@ icking and organic crime each year , the kill@@ ers of journalists are only rarely provided by journalists .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ tr@@ ater@@ ally east and even though the terrain is still av@@ enger .
without information about the kill@@ ers , without justice , the meeting has little benefit to the discussion of security , I@@ bar@@ ra says .
&quot; it is very stupid , my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we do not know why , we mi@@ str@@ ust all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 Val@@ dez left the Office of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce newspaper in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ d River . &quot;
the shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to go free in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but there is practically nothing to be silent about Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans , last year and the surrender to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the most bloody batt@@ le@@ fields in the country , since rival fac@@ tions are strug@@ gling to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a someone or several people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of buried , two @-@ story maus@@ ol@@ eums for drug @-@ goats , which are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes two mis@@ concep@@ tions contributed to the murder .
first of all , there were publication of an interview with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of a rival cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed gang@@ crew bought every copy of the output when she was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez , after the capture of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country to his own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing will be considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues believed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced reporter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he merged with five colleagues at the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without having to viol@@ ate the anti@@ d@@ ote problem , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
at the time , the newspaper served a reputation for cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and turnover and advertising recorded .
rep@@ orters loved it , hard to publish studies without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that nobody else could be treated .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot award &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursu@@ it of Mexican drug history , where ever it led them .
he gave himself up voluntarily , that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug dealers in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV last October .
&quot; you need to take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What have you done so much of death ? why did you not say what went before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ak bird , who was like a do@@ ck@@ workers , who was generous with hu@@ gs and rat@@ chet , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always be to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , go to the same table there .
now they ask : was his love toward the routine his destruction ?
his death also forced them to ask her own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how to do their work on the best and to stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , home run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ awareness and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
when it comes wrong , you stay away .
the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing with Javier is happening . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cra@@ tive s@@ mu@@ ters , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where employees met by Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce to the security training , suddenly no cell phones were allowed . days earlier , Spy@@ ware , which is exclusively sold to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a mid @-@ class building in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in scher@@ z , some of the rep@@ orters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , who described governor himself as not trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the rep@@ orters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug @-@ subjects are under control under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has cli@@ cked on three main stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of the former Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Chavez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state spending , focusing on the hom@@ etown of the govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the State Office , conducted a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidnapped , or how it happened , so it was advis@@ able to write as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician , who ruled the ruling In@@ stitutional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , who ruled all political pl@@ ains all over the century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ term corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the reporter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went to a military attack .
only a few months earlier , the readers would have considered the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ute . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the staff had become something that they have never expected : activists in the name of the press .
reporter Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the Office of the State Plan .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western State of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his .
journalists have become more powerful throughout the country by organized protests in the &quot; SOS Press &quot; protagon@@ ists .
this day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone to Washington and is trying to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in Val@@ dez &apos;s case .
in a meeting with Governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to sp@@ elling journalists and kill them because they said the truth .
she has since then asked that it is divided again from the government because it is concerned that their anger has hurt its objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico have been organised by organizational crimes , involved in government officials and a equality society . &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters did not only be killed by drug inter@@ iors , but also on orders from politicians and security forces , which st@@ oned with organised crime under a blanket .
last year , the Media W@@ igh@@ ter Group &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll die in Mexico because they want you to hold the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ami@@ rez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and search for dangers .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the same day , when Javier was murdered , the intern asked me to send it to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used camoufl@@ age to sof@@ ten his enemies
at first glance , it looks like a statue , even a sc@@ ary .
now , researchers found that the first findings of an incredible rhin@@ oc@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even determine that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had had something of a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
the report in the Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the pat@@ tern@@ ed dinosau@@ rs who has ever been found , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs pieces in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ thought state has researchers that describe it as &quot; really remarkable , &quot; stun@@ ned
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the arm@@ oured plant @-@ e@@ aters is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Shawn Funk , when he was dug in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine close to Fort Mc@@ Murray in the North of Alberta , Canada , dug on 21 March 2011 .
he hit something that seemed to the surrounding rocks at Plat@@ ze , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent into the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy soil .
after all this hard work , the ready result is now ready to be unveiled .
&quot; if you are only blind with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main actor Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosau@@ rs copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the dinosau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this plant @-@ e@@ aters , although it is covered with a arm@@ or , and resem@@ bles a rolling tank , probably threatened by meat @-@ carni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs .
the strongly arm@@ oured dinosau@@ rs used a red and white camoufl@@ age , to hide themselves from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a par@@ atro@@ opers that is known as a counter@@ balance , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to mix himself better into its surroundings and to sof@@ ten his enemies , experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creation from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made headlines in May and is now shown in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and there is Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum techn@@ ician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed it to extract Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ aments over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sha@@ ded , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the head of the creature was dar@@ ker than its bottom .
although the con@@ dens@@ ation is common , the results are surprising , since the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the survi@@ ving animals live .
it indicates that the dinosau@@ rs have been hun@@ ted by carni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , that the evolution of the confron@@ tation of confron@@ tation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sha@@ ded - think of R@@ ehe , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable as a prey , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real struggle for survival .
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , heavily broken dinosau@@ rs show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs have to have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; Brown said .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ r was bay .
scientists will continue to examine the animal on evidence of his life , including his overall perform@@ ers to find out what it had eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ rs died when he died , into a river , and driven into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea .
at this time , Alberta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland as they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable because it is covered completely with preser@@ ving skin but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal . &quot; Brown said .
&quot; the result is that the animal today looks like almost as in the early chal@@ k time .
you don &apos;t need to use fantasy to recon@@ struct it . if you only have a little bit with the eyes , you could think that he is sleeping in sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when giant Ther@@ opo@@ den , carni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , stood on two legs , crossed the earth .
although the king of them , Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after the Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mo@@ red dinosau@@ rs was ch@@ ased out of some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11@@ ,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster .
the scientists , their latest findings in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sank after the death in the sea and in mud .
the creature was found by Shawn Funk , when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine close to Fort Mc@@ Murray in the North of Alberta , Canada , dug on 21 March 2011 .
according to the museum it is the preserved Dinosau@@ rs in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips which were ra@@ ined by his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured plant @-@ e@@ aters was pushed by western Canada until the flooded river was flooded into the open sea .
but the underwater spl@@ end@@ or of the dinosau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so good , that the Hau@@ tre@@ ad still covers more hol@@ ised arm@@ oured plates along the dinosau@@ rs
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko written for National Ge@@ ographic is such a level of conservation as &apos; rarely as a profit in lot@@ tery .
the more I get it , the more confused it becomes .
the remains of the skin still cover the hol@@ low Ar@@ mo@@ red plates , which carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers crossed out upwards .
I can count the scales at its sole count .
in the th@@ under@@ storm : scale of Mass@@ acre at A8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a massage stud .
there are numerous clubs , kilometers long st@@ out - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) the late Thursday afternoon , about 20 people were injured in the late Thursday afternoon .
according to the police , the police were between 5 : 00 and 5 : 00 pm between the con@@ jun@@ c@@ eries of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , while a storm of almost 30 vehicles , including trucks , were probably also lor@@ ry .
no information about the exact number of the injured deposits initially did not appear .
it was light to moderate injuries , said a police officer .
a huge array of life vehicles was at the accident scene .
the A8 was completely closed in Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a distance of ten kilometres formed a long way back .
like an AZ reporter , it also appeared on the return journey to massive disabilities - by numerous g@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade noted the marks of the vehicle , which now have to calculate with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 the second accident happened to the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was also a coll@@ ision between a car sport and passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everybody has experienced once : nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps .
or one is ti@@ lled in his work and has just a genius idea .
and then : buff@@ f .
the conductor comes , and ar@@ ouses the ride out of the workflow in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of breaks are soon gone .
the Deutsche Bahn currently tests the smart ticket control .
it is simply confirmed by the mobile phone that the ticket is taken and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently a test run runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer if we are coming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a train speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is called by train the ticket rank@@ ings without a conductor .
in order to use this , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to booked an online ticket - what most passengers do already anyway .
you have to have bought it via the app , DB Navigator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
and last one needs a seat reservation .
because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : one gets into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My Ticket . &quot;
the test customers will then appear a button to electronic discharge .
the train drivers get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is located in the train and has taken the booked seat space Y .
if the train manager is at No. Y , he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with already an update on @-@ line ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two benefits : one for the client , one for train - which should use the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you would like to travel without a ticket control by our train team , check out the DB Navigator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this enables the passengers to make their travel time to the train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management of DB Cor@@ respon@@ ding .
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to go to individual customer needs . &quot;
anyone who often travels , knows that in addition to delay and missed trains , the ticket controls are one of the greatest ass@@ essments .
because often , in any case , one of the co @-@ travelers don &apos;t have all the documents that you need for the dev@@ al@@ uation of online tickets .
either is missing the credit card or identity card or any document that you need to point .
the result are endless discussions between mig@@ rating heads and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the part or greater space and del@@ ays in control of your own tickets and the conductor at the end time takes to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies to the connections of ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked .
how an activist came to study the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken by her core .
only one day after having arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which they rented and sc@@ roll@@ ers through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled over a mail from someone from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police had just killed an 18 year old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else had posted information on their feed , she completed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly ret@@ ched on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of brow@@ ns le@@ pale body that stretched out onto the road and stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he thought to it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she finished her mobile phone to receive twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive in the evening .
there was photos of the police tape and people , the scre@@ aming , and from a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who had a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed , where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a f@@ lap dog .
in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman has his ri@@ fle and cried , &quot; I will all kill you ... animals all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ minded to your testimony . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to us and we can call it typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment , I felt shi@@ vers .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 @-@ year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two will go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and protests , love and losses , strength and resistance , which consists of the point of view of the people who have filled in community and have filled the streets to ask answers .
as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , wearing a flower dress and a matching crown , came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , talking the two conversations that they had countless times ahead of this morning , &quot; over the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight with what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 year old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take her , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know , and you &apos;ll see it and it will be tra@@ cked up .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution , and what we need to do to free ourselves .
even if I &apos;m lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not have any v@@ lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is not different than the next black women .
I feel that I would prove her a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place across the police station , which became a camping area when activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter have joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared po@@ ckets , and helped to pass on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and not@@ ices that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to only &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you be documented or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ tic@@ ism has been nourished by countless cases of people , often of White - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
as Follow in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an already worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ ct occup@@ ants .
his commitment was brought closer to Fer@@ rell &apos;s project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after brow@@ ns creation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people will be depicted , for so shall I be presented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim was not to concentrate on Fer@@ re@@ lls experience - to show that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not around a Messiah leaders , but for a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; the personal aspects of Fer@@ re@@ lls lives as she loves and marry her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understand that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and with the goals of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , Fer@@ re@@ lls &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who had st@@ amped the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ re Mat@@ ter &quot; after the killing of the black teenage mat@@ ch@@ ment in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we are constantly fighting for different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not a affir@@ m type of action , &quot; where Fer@@ rell was selected as the heart of the film .
&quot; she was the person responsible for this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coincidence , although she was at the fore@@ front , because in a life at these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman stands so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can sense their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have gone long ago , but the rac@@ ist links between the community and police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years due to blocking an auto@@ bahn at a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ o @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos &quot; .
nevertheless they appe@@ aled to a singing and she feels committed to that memory since three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , on the street .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ ahn &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss their bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the Sü@@ ver of pedestrian prec@@ inct since the first presentation of 2009 has its support in supporters and opponents .
cold leaves the topic cold .
the theme is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while the one to the one @-@ bit gallery says : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; This would be real class &quot; ( Nicole Sc@@ ots ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no human being &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; size ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the advoc@@ ates build on that a gallery will attract more customers in the city , of which the other businesses are benef@@ iting , fear that the pedestrian street is bleeding .
added : the gallery is planned precisely on the property , on which the farmers market stands on , in the 13 direct marketing their products .
at the beginning of the construction , it will be completed .
the gallery mo@@ vers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with the possibility of sitting outside .
Simone rooms : &quot; we have been buying almost every week in the farmers market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the ma@@ ids are always happy again .
the but@@ cher was also discovered for us too .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery , there is a chance to maintain this offer .
there are also other cities in other cities .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery will be set up at the level of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new project should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is your shopping destination in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think it &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough in our city .
you see how many shop shops are empty here - some have been within months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is more important that at least the market stands remains .
after all , the goods offered there is fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is also cheap .
as you can see , shop shops are rented in a shopping center only of larger firms , because the local ten@@ ets are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , special stores there is almost no more and what is left , then will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where is the pe@@ asant market place during the building time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even when the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does it already create the Sp@@ ect@@ st bit gallery before , to drive out all the shops of Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it simply doesn &apos;t work .
and a shopping center that stands empty , nobody needs .
in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .
but for a pe@@ asant market , there is no more space thanks to the ins@@ ane many - how I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more place .
if the farmer &apos;s market is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
an appropriate simil@@ arity : artist creates portrait with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost invisible as they are hanging from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks and hair cut , which you were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analyst entered a 35 @-@ year sentence after completing diplomatic consultations on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition that opened on 2 August is A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was united in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and landmark dis@@ sidents , was converted to condem@@ nation by Barack Obama as he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was created by the algorithm analysis of the DNA that could look from Mann@@ ing and out of the 30 portraits , such as anyone can be interpreted with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent det@@ er@@ min@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing who was born as Bradley Edward , but had already talked about the identification as a woman , has been sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age Act , computer fraud and theft .
due to the prison their image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing sits visi@@ bly on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ in@@ blond wi@@ gs - with which it was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in this , the artist portraits of foreigners from for@@ en@@ sic Art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette st@@ alls and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture how these people might look like this .
it was the time that she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not visit this time and could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use were un@@ happy bri@@ eff@@ er@@ ings , who ruled several letters in the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ ped comic &quot; Supp@@ orted Images , &quot; which would fore@@ see a future in which the president Chel@@ ated Jud@@ gement would convert and it would be able to see the exhibition himself .
the fact that Obama was actually just a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing was just calling for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome type of happy re@@ union .
there is also in the opening of the exhibition some deep and Star@@ kes , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ t from the government camp and to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to stop the rigid divisions which he actually should fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things are going to happen for a specific reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for Mann@@ ing with their over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name is provided with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic crash site , whose foundation sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall , its mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ de based on the high @-@ developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological ways , we are all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hope to take away is that our gen@@ ome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also shown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in its own room , is a page from the top @-@ mentioned comic nov@@ elle .
she shows Mann@@ ing as she emerg@@ es as King Kong with a free slide show in the United States of the United States as King Kong .
&quot; if they ch@@ ill your speech , then they have won . &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came straight from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who greeted from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I always get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was supposed to do in the comic book - but if they should do it , then it will be greeted in the center of space by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic Sim@@ ul@@ ak@@ ras , who were gathered like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also targeted as everything in the exhibition , until size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where her genetic h@@ ap@@ ers were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past , I had it on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which was also behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford
a nationwide man @-@ hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee at the University of Oxford , who sought to be susp@@ icious for a man in a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday the indictment was issued on Monday to W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest war@@ rants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several bul@@ lets .
a common warning system by the Chicago Department of Police , which was discovered on July 27 , was discovered by the Chicago Department .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments , and found victims with several injuries on his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared on the site of the action for dead , and det@@ ective investigate the stit@@ ches as murder while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
since 2007 L@@ ath@@ em has been extraordinary professor for micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for the university relations , said in an e @-@ mail address that L@@ ath@@ em was now ur@@ king into ur@@ ur@@ ly and was excluded from entering the North@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal issue which is examined by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University collabor@@ ates in this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man of the University and the Somer@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail address that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK in contact and willing to help US investig@@ ative authorities . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren colleagues were shocked and want it to be .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi police authority , said he urge the susp@@ ects to set up the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has an idea of their position , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building which had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip , said that in apartment 100@@ 8 had happened .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
the Grand Plaza &apos;s management team published a statement to the residents : &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the victim &apos;s background and explo@@ res a wide variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian vice @-@ president Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage fulfilling the criteria of the schedule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this regard , &quot; Mut@@ ko explained on Thursday .
the PM on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for repe@@ ating R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain any thing for Russia .
&quot; all has been announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities accepted the reported results from the WA@@ DA licensed investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren .
regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we conduct the investigation as our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has caused a mistake .
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no government programs , and we will not admit what exists . &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os &apos;s words voted by Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping commission .
in conversation with Russian sales offices at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v announced problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report en@@ controversial positions and regulations .
no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as part of the D@@ oping sc@@ andal from the WA@@ DA implementation control in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving into the right direction , &quot; to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that your company will help you do not become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ rett did not want to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the p@@ olls did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful , or worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently .
and even if you promised anony@@ m@@ ity , some workers were not sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ rett , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called people from the outside to help .
a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is at the wa@@ xes to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of the measurement of employees , it allows companies to conduct surveys , Special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ n allowing to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite leaders and turn them directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools is used by companies to measure employees commitment .
Er@@ rett said she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap p@@ olls and p@@ olls of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company which shows at a glance , which units have most complaints and which executives have low form@@ att@@ ing results - so that you can drill .
companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain , so that you have not been involved in Sk@@ and@@ als , which has been published in Sk@@ and@@ als since a former employee describing a blog post which , for those who have spoken is punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is possible for an overview a lu@@ cra@@ tive business possibility .
by 2020 , global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value according to the financial technical website let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behaviour and recognize it saw an increasing interest and activity beginning this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently signed as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , converting company tailor @-@ made &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; surveys , confi@@ dential answers in real @-@ time collecting and watch the warmth @-@ cards of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline which can report bad behavior .
and if the chief executive agent is involved , complaints are direct to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgment of public opinion has captured the regulations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that his employees are badly treated or in@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , employee fluctu@@ ation and cl@@ ages , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , Conver@@ cent has used more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and a simple way to achieve its headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail to the company &apos;s headquarters , a formal complaint and hope to be taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said , there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of staff .
now , since the company Conver@@ cent is set up , problems caused by managers who were hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or in@@ geni@@ ous intern@@ s are identified and addressed .
&quot; I can closer to this hol@@ istic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; Vit@@ rano said the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders in front of employment relations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take eth@@ ics , values and employees in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collapsed because of ethical violations of the Enron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
but it took until the &quot; Social Media came to their right , &quot; that businesses realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor eth@@ ics , human hope used as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and ass@@ els the companies with recur@@ rent fees for use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February by companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz secured $ 10 million in November by Bess@@ emer venture partner and brought up his entire funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex in research that shows that today &apos;s staff are more expecting from their jobs than previously .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only bet@@ s .
the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated , and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be able to feel in a company that is worth their voices , and that the work that you do is worthwhile , then they feel more strongly committed to make this enterprise successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which both Conver@@ t and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors gain yields , when its portfolio enterprises are running well . companies are running well when employees are employed and engaged .
if the analy@@ tics tools are third @-@ party promise to increase commitment and deployment of the workers , it is no wonder that you will find assistance .
the data on employee commitment according to experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless when the administrator of an enterprise have no measures .
in fact , if a company asks employees to your feedback , it may have a expec@@ tation that changes is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , this can motiv@@ ate dis@@ appointments and employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company focusing on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow the staff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Madison Reed , who now introduces monthly employee surveys , was able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day if a problem is reported over G@@ lin@@ t , so learn .
and after collecting feedback by fru@@ str@@ ated employees , she was able to organize and implement several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday the company always receives new insights on the staff , and it hopes that in a long run , this leads to a better binding of workers in a industry that is known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose man , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose company .
the N@@ CAA removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it goes on at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A Foot@@ ball@@ ers are talking on one side of the new exercise fields on the campus .
some have gone out their tri@@ cot parts and show off the back full of sweat from the first day of training camp .
for a good part of the team , take a lunch break .
players who are enrolled at the summer courses are returning after the three @-@ hour exercise , before they return at 6 : 30 am to the water@@ man Football Center next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the boys the next three days a real pedal mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CAA eliminated two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and it is actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .
that is why the first three training sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A will begin at 19 : 15 to meet the players already completed .
com@@ promising from the two days is more than a day that brood the brood in the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time while Mor@@ as took six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to stay in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the beginning of formal preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de to Texas A &amp; M in September .
MOR@@ A said he is the regulation of N@@ CAA support , even if they add a further point to the player &apos;s most busy routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put three or four days on it , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it , they have plac@@ ks on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it really becomes great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end up their practices as soon as the Camp is finished , setting the clear sight@@ ings of its fields in a adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already opened its protection grid behind a door posts , which will be no easy task .
Bru@@ ins players are to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem when they are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our safety , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far from being caught up to rent there a room and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video content of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have all too big concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts testing in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential items with fal@@ cons to fac@@ simile accounts of third parties and their results below the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will start with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to recognize possible detection cases and to send them to fac@@ simile testing , which may display results of the fac@@ simile testing from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of which believe that they also influenced the 2016 presidential elections .
the problem has become a major political subject in Europe , with the French elec@@ tors in May with false stories , and Germany also supports a plan to be punished according to social media networks if it does not succeed to eliminate h@@ asser@@ ts post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook in a separate statement in German , that in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of the new facts review .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the realization that stories of fac@@ simile checks from the third parties , people want to read more context to read and share what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; test &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conjunction with the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then work on other changes to his news feed to decrease false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze @-@ music video and was a gor@@ ges for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he years .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history in the Consci@@ ous River valley in K@@ ent and now is the inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; I think it &apos;s so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says bl@@ amed .
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos;s sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney - Isaac L@@ enk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he found un@@ expect@@ edly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just got on the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter which was written by a dual agents in the 1700 @-@ s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is his thum@@ b print !
and letters always smell as smoke , because they kind@@ led a fire because of light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect when he himself would .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is involved with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have been a little over@@ rated &quot; ) this seems to be true to be true .
Rho@@ dos spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , like the mon@@ stro@@ ked an@@ gled buttons on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ches .
he emigrated through the area and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with Land@@ scapes , gar@@ dener , and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust got the full access in 2006 , when the last Er@@ am , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rhodes arrived a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , put it on the loft . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Empire , maps , which would pose that which possessed : &quot; one could mean that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch who fought two families .
guys , let everything go ahead ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to fill on a wider basis into the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man , who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer &apos;s figure of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that appeared in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rhodes .
&quot; the farmer began in this area and I thought a revol@@ t was a good start .
perhaps the two are connected together ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons , the family Dar@@ rell ran for seven years in the English Re@@ formation hidden .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , portra@@ yed in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , portra@@ yed his own funeral ( a discovery that was made only years later when his sar@@ g was dug up ) .
the Dar@@ re@@ lls are Rhodes &quot; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed to be a great G@@ aun@@ er , getting debts and spending money for things that they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men loose their school crises by giving up rich old women - I imagine it as a he@@ ap of good @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adver@@ tise land@@ locked . &quot;
after the end of his approach in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique scre@@ aming experiences
he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ der@@ än@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been demanded from nature again .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be done with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : covered over 300 years old Mari@@ b@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the unveil@@ ing of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started her campaign for introducing a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau of Thursday ) .
even until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team comp@@ elled to keep the logo and the slogan .
at the end of August , there will be a celebration of the campaign on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? , &quot; the makers of the promotion has been on posters on the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel yesterday .
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their un@@ locked website .
&quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make it clear that much better is better than it seems .
basically , we are the firm conviction that we know as bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens to know the beauty and attraction of our city . &quot;
for the promotion , there is more than just &quot; a logo and slogan , it is called further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a universal promise , one that surro@@ unds the city a distinctive unique item . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities .
the average five @-@ digit amount is the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f to cost their new umbrella brand and the campaign .

at first glance , a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting did not take place in the building of Staff , as previously , but in the prime minister of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the government , the leaders of the government also took part of the five vice @-@ president and the Minister for Defence , Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the valley .
the government pul@@ ls the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force , and the Navy were removed .
since the failed coup , Prime Minister Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , Erdo@@ gan as a wire suspension .
up to 4@@ 86 people who have been involved in the attempt of the coup attempt , is negoti@@ ating in Ankara since this week .
even on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had designated the overthrow of &quot; God &apos;s gift , &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have a grip on ?
in the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ es@@ days in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in general staff there are concerns of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , who manifest itself among other things in the lifting of the head@@ scarf ban for Sol@@ dier , wrote the newspaper .
anyway , the bulk of the army in the army and security forces goes on anyway .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan sent a further 73@@ 95 power operators , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan was t@@ amed up the military .
the gener@@ als are earlier than the true masters of the country .
three times , they were under appeal to their role as sent@@ in@@ els of state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan rejected the power of the military step by step , not least by calling for reform of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is managing targeted an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; an officer called no @-@ called officer , who sought out persecution in foreign countries abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot;
if this applies , the Nato could not let NATO get cold .
there is a doubt in the alliance after pur@@ ge of doubts about the victims of the Turkish army .
the management structures and operational skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; says Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
it will give a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he is looking to lower the legal immig@@ rant to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules on earnings of visa for a temporary job permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , saving wages and will save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by the United States will change the way as to citizens from other countries of Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial resources to support themselves and knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to san@@ itation circuit for racing and shuttle
over the past few months , over the future of the racing team was disputed - now it &apos;s meant to go fast .
even before the end of the year the tourist route should be built , on which the tourist railway drives will be built .
in order to secure the future of the racing team to the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport this year , construction work will start on the route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order and re@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , conf@@ esses the country to this particular link , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Transport Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the over@@ h@@ aul of the track was reduced to approximately 2.5 million euros .
this sum over 75 percent of the country .
the contract , on which the shuttle may also be ordered from the country in the future , will currently be matched , S@@ üh@@ l declared .
the Ministry and the Southern District as an operator will already agree on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the road@@ map which negotiated vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ üh@@ l said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle will be held in December 2017 .
the racing kick @-@ Shuttle is one of the most popular rail connections between the Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g rail stations .
during the past months , the course of a pilot project was tested , whether the distance of sufficient many people is used to order it in the future .
the circuit is also highly dil@@ api@@ dated in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about
just as you thought that 2017 may not be re@@ processed in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robot .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking their as@@ cen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose eyel@@ ash of the robot , its shape of ni@@ p@@ ples and type of fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; people are funny about them , but the companies deliver any quantity of it , and we will get much more common to see , &quot; Mr Shar@@ key said the publication of his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone membrane which feels warm - with consciously human reactions to be achieved through artificial intelligence .
the user can also custom@@ ize its robot according to its beliefs , &quot; and select everything from the color of the robot via the shape of breast canc@@ ers to type or colour of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
but there is still wor@@ rying as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; who would look like a Step@@ ford @-@ woman progressive .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots with a silicone membrane .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example to adjust its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they will be pleasing such as school@@ ing .
and then there is still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed individuals such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; who convey@@ s the impression of school@@ ing and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that has been adapted as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Comp@@ an@@ ion .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you do not like , etc .
in the course of the day , it also has its m@@ oods - just like real people !
it can be tired to be fixed in conversation or she can be &quot; in the mood ! &quot;
there are many wor@@ rying aspects of this rise of Sex @-@ robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ ways of female properties , the incen@@ tives on rape , when you take a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : resi@@ sting ) Far@@ rah is concerned .
on his website true True Comp@@ an@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vi@@ br@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vi@@ br@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it &apos;s on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just just another sex toy .
their emergence and their growing refin@@ ement show a little dar@@ ker and deeper deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the Ideal of Gender equality to a desire for sex with under@@ p@@ ation as an optional addition .
most men are of course not holding sex robots , while FR@@ R not@@ ices its rising popularity , they still remain in the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what le@@ ak@@ ened out of the boundary , can be in terms of the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or offensive , up to them the free market gives the permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are immer@@ sed in a time , in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which in the White House there is a pre@@ sidents who have been pra@@ ved to have women sexually attacked .
the most awesome aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the more swallowed body and the out@@ stretched eyes , but how realistic that vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this doesn &apos;t feel like a big jump .
the goal behind this sex robot lies there , a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if even with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their inheritance , they feel human being , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , at the point , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots don &apos;t represent real women .
you cannot separate or go away from their companions .
they have no medi@@ ation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything , which could distur@@ b the imagination of life .
expressed differently : they are counterfeit slaves .
or to express it in the verb@@ s of 2017 : ma@@ ids
tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney for the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
it has become a Bin@@ sen@@ we@@ ary of the tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions , which have polarized the US voters that have split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Than@@ ksgiving , there were newspapers in the USA newspapers with advice about how to circum@@ vent with the horror of tr@@ ump @-@ chosen relatives .
we prop@@ elled all of us to burst into our filter bubbles .
less noticed has the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , families bring together .
I mention this because my cousin , a left @-@ left poet , who lives in Chicago , has long lived with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family for a long time , visited me this week in New York .
they re@@ minded me that the unity could have a mighty effect against a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship , having fought for decades of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
in order to make the dining table , this certainly is a good thing , but it falls to me in another connection that this also brings significant risks .
the Left has been strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the effective effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right .
when we speak of &quot; Norm@@ alisation &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ epy possibility that his m@@ itt@@ ens will not get rid of one day .
however , there is still a frigh@@ tened long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing is &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of as@@ on@@ abl@@ eness .
I find myself today by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the decline - the dog on the car level , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement looked ) - both in comparison with tr@@ ump in fact occur in a very mild stra@@ ft@@ aten .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans will only be spirit@@ ually healthy to qualify as un@@ measur@@ able improvement .
when my cousin in the city was , we brought our children to car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ el of New York Park@@ department , and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city , if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are ch@@ ur@@ red and the animals rotate to look full of fear on their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clim@@ atic music im@@ s this strange way .
as many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings will be old , the Sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the issues @-@ pub ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage do not count - but a great round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ el is still a strange magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on and all have a great time .
if I could have checked the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to rep@@ ay the evaluation by a 15 % tip - this to something about the counter top .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what is supposed to be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation , which is not necessary .
the poor woman in the department store stood un@@ ab@@ dic@@ ated , while I was tired of the experience she made my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred to the hospital
for the second time Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was transferred to the hospital for treating ch@@ ats to his hand , which he had suffered the prison authorities after a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of the Valentine &apos;s Day in 2013 by offering them several times through a door of toilet cabin in his house in Pret@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a night inv@@ aders , which hid himself in the cabin hidden .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to put this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say it was too transparent .
the National Prosecutor of Law said that it will be up@@ set at the Supreme Court of South Africa and the burden could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there are no death penalty in South Africa .

software update for diesel cars : what you need to know ?
how exactly does the software update take place ?
does diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers are at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars .
the emissions have to improve emissions of cars from the emission categories Euro 5 and a partial Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ ted .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ al@@ anine from the ACE car Club Europe gives ass@@ essments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the handled software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only for the vehicles that matches tunes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ al@@ anine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its re@@ armament has arranged the power station @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed of updates ?
manufacturers have announced an excellent implementation in the next few months , but no exact date is called .
Daimler has communic@@ ated to all those affected .
if it is due to an inspection , this will be done in its scope .
how long is the upgra@@ des changed altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ al@@ anine says .
the relations from the producer &apos;s commitment and political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen it voluntarily negoti@@ ating the car manufacturers on the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the upgrade itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to receive an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE advis@@ es to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would move , so S@@ met@@ al@@ anine .
is now a massive price fall from Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears it .
but just in the regions where the drivers are threatening .
in rural area , there is no value loss for older diesel .
the ACE advis@@ es to wait for sale yet .

we do the city li@@ ve@@ able
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to retirement next year .
the site is already written - suitable applicants are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister since 31 years .
and the work makes him still great fun , as he convey@@ s in the press line .
he reports varied , but also demanding tasks that wait for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , no application seems to make the requirement profile .
the city is looking for the next possible time an architect or building engineer .
thus , under the dis@@ regard of the regular job @-@ term - is still enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach was employed for the administrative community as a sub@@ ordin@@ ance agency , applicants must refer to applicants .
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
if they cannot fill them , the citizens would have to take advice until Offen@@ burg .
but the town@@ spe@@ c is the city and himself important , W@@ acker said that by a good company lim@@ a as well as good sen@@ timent between authority and citizens .
over 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated , looking back to the h@@ ack@@ ers with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city a lively , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are available on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the low @-@ door parking space .
the cruci@@ fix@@ ion between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium is still subject .
the latter alone will strike around 1.5 million euros , &quot; when we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
work here is fun . &quot;
become a conf@@ ec@@ lec@@ tic part of a city master space .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ t@@ ner@@ i , it could be very flexible in many respects .
&quot; you can move much , &quot; so h@@ ack@@ ers , and the design of the green spaces are often mentioned by citizens and visitors .
as the old city centre stands under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye for it , &quot; if new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ises the separ@@ ating city master .
there is high responsibility in the city of Stadt@@ bau@@ at@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything runs here on my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count on long@@ standing staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been around for 15 years .
even though his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identi@@ fies and stay with the job . &quot;
because continuity is not only important for a good farm , but also for the other design of the city .
if Roland W@@ acker wants to bury such studies as a graduate engineer or Bachelor in the city of Has@@ lach , a graduate engineer can offer architecture and knowledge of good knowledge in the fields of construction and building planning .
the municipal office building underground high @-@ construction and civil engineering , building management , real estate companies , urban operation of building yard and urban gardening services including sub@@ sid@@ ental rights , including monument protection .
bicycle on lines thrown : South rail route
according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators had thrown the blue bicycle from the train track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ese Street ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so heavily damaged , that the resulting freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators walk from two male troops and seek after them for the night &apos;s night .
a bicycle driver and a bicycle driver was observed near the crime scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond an Laus@@ anno@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ rators brought himself into great danger even to the train traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beside the damage to the Lo@@ k and the facility , as well as the delay of delay and the cost of rail freight , even p@@ inn@@ als of the rail@@ ways could also be taken to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; altogether , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; sum &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage were fixed on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the south track could be run without disabilities .
close to ten person@@ als were Friday morning , two of them entered the correspondence .
goods do not fell out , however , they had delay .
according to Ö@@ BB &apos;s spokesperson , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced approximately 200 metres of upper lines .
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( Infl@@ amed bo@@ wel disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study asser@@ ts just the opposite : a diet that is rich in flesh @-@ based proteins and dairy products could be the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases .
the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and Britain , causes stomach cra@@ mps and bl@@ ot@@ ings , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhoea , weight loss and extreme drow@@ sin@@ ess .
during those affected , researchers are advised to avoid meat and dairy products to prevent their symptoms , researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han found to develop immune cells that promote immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ines pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hide in the body does not penet@@ rate into the body .
cells that are inher@@ ent to determine inflammation , are balanced by cells , which promote tolerance and protect the body , without damage to sensitive tissues .
if the equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um is too far in the direction of inflammation , it may result in an anti inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments , it was found that a kind of tolerance enh@@ ancing immune cell in mice , which carry a particular bacter@@ ium in their inn@@ ards .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ oms , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich nutrition can be toler@@ ated , less flamm@@ able intestinal mi@@ li@@ eus , when the same system looks at humans .
the post @-@ doctoral fellow Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was seeking a type of immune cells that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study of study such cells had , but another group of the same tribe , which was separated , this was not .
they presum@@ ed that the difference was to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omen of the mice , the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that usually live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells , but without it were missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they were not l@@ acked a gut micro@@ bi@@ om and they did not have developed these kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria re@@ acted to the immune system , the researchers sent L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then carried small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant toler@@ ating cells .
when the active component was cleaned out of liquid , it proved itself as a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ metabolism , known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ant properties like mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i are developing the cells at humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han value can result in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; in Manchester United , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pounds description of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEFA Super Cup begins with Real Madrid on Tuesday and impressed as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia tour and only managed 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him earlier than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u started the Avi@@ va Stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho started his start XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three more new@@ sl@@ ings , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to fulfil three of its four primary labour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four to get , I thank you to the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilot flo@@ ats from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan , and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which is several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens , the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a lasting test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new proposal for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
like the wind , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , the prime minister of the Prime Minister were always concerned with a certain concern to Berlin .
only no stor@@ yt@@ ale from the party headquarters , merely no head@@ wind from the Bund - was the most important desire for the election warrior .
since Martin Schulz , the party has changed , the fundament@@ ally changed .
since then , the employees of Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus observe the events in the SPD @-@ gover@@ ned national capit@@ als .
what Schulz has been from there since the beginning of the year , would not even be described in the approach .
there were ad@@ ditions .
and one after the other .
following the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the CD@@ U was a general signal to the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green cannot be righ@@ tly gover@@ ned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising frac@@ tion@@ aries of a Green M@@ EPs had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the national elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Gre@@ ens @-@ Bundes@@ amt Michael Kell@@ ner called on the back@@ sliding of the Green Party of El@@ ke T@@ wice to return their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear dis@@ appointment of the elec@@ tor .
El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return their mandate , &quot; said the Federal Managing Director and campaign of the Green Party of the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she sigh@@ ed a SPD election warrior than on Friday morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ Message to the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the over@@ pass of the green MPs El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CD@@ U without their own government .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole rows of large and small crises in the SPD @-@ country associations .
and no one knows what &apos;s next .
the Mis@@ ere began an unexpected defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , anymore , calm down the com@@ rades of the time .
after the parliamentary elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
it was then , too - and it was all clearly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into exchange , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite breath@@ ed the party smoothly .
com@@ rades , com@@ rades , com@@ rades in the weeks afterwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , when they had just exhausted new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the next depth came with him .
Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend , because he was in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his town burned .
and because he was so wrong in the crisis communications , making something wrong about what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz fights for his political survival .
and now Stephan Weil .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust and his role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister , the Dutch Prime Minister , had already been critic@@ ised today .
mi@@ ese re@@ frac@@ tures were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps , because in the past few weeks , Weil tried to get stronger in the acc@@ ents .
com@@ rades of the former mayor of Hannover from Hanover , his power in Berlin remained not hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him that they said of because of because of a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in doing so , Weil am involved in the part@@ ying area of the Sax@@ on green in essence , no guilt .
and Schulz didn &apos;t even do that .
sometimes , com@@ rades would make an effort to keep their own ranks .
its anger focuses on the Gre@@ ens , and especially on the back@@ sliding par@@ liament@@ ar@@ ier@@ es T@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , like Mrs T@@ jack@@ ets , its own career @-@ making about the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the party leader in the SPD Parliamentary Group , the editorial network Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. T@@ jack@@ ets is not elected as a direct candidate , but on the national list of the Sax@@ on green in parliament , so the Dutch @-@ Sax@@ on MP continues .
the logical consequence is that it returns their mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group , proc@@ laim a &quot; uns@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters for four years ago was clear : people made Stephan Weil &apos;s prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the lower sax@@ onian SPD as top candidate for the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal loan portfolio of a future CD@@ U members for@@ ged the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he demanded to clear the backgrounds .
I want to know if there has been more or more further comm@@ itments of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for town centre III
who wants to re@@ ate his own house in the year , can get support from the country soon .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of the city development on Wednesday in sens@@ ing .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler returned once again a review to the date .
since 1991 it has been in sens@@ ing regions .
at that time , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , Baden @-@ Württemberg country took over two thirds of the funding .
in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the allow@@ ance was still at 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior development , and not only include new buildings .
on 4 April , by the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Karlsruhe , you received the information that there will be an rehabilitation area III .
the funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 Euro , which would be 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the church sens@@ ations .
how is a renovation area then arises ?
one will continue to investigate so sh@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
however , it plays a role whether in the planned area will be an interest to san@@ itation .
if necessary , the territorial limits could then shift the territory once again .
the cover represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
Keller presented the content of the federal states &apos; Social city , &quot; which will be conducted in the framework of the renov@@ ations .
the core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alisation of city teams , improving the living and working conditions and receiving the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is carried out per plot .
the renovation area would eventually be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the approval period for the funding is running since January 1 , 2017 to April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , only once the inventory will be performed , as part of those involved in the restoration area involved a questionnaire .
if possible , in November or December , the stat@@ utory ship will be set to begin with the renov@@ ations in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then declared that every commune had to be carried out @-@ on pre @-@ investigations .
it is about to evaluate the urban mis@@ ery , and decide when it is gentle , and to which extent .
there will also be a cancellation in the basic book for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to sensation and take a picture of the location , she promised .
Got@@ zel empha@@ sized , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of hol@@ dings .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires , which will be post@@ ally sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and boundary ar@@ c &quot; which , among other things , is about the structural condition and the remedi@@ ation views .
in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary and housing &quot; , data can be made to size , distribution , and residents of a residential area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; factory bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be completed when buildings are operated under the premises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Got@@ zel , however , pointed out that a fixed questionnaire is not at the same time a application for funding .
moreover , new building measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler also stressed that the allocation of the funding for the &quot; wind@@ dog principle &quot; work - who first comes , first comes first .
you could not make any conveyor funds for later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for completion , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local core II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make a renovation of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor sets itself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand @-@ held movement in the house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door@@ step , entering his office , and can even start with a hand @-@ run movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and index finger and now offers the service to businesses and individuals who want their life with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out according to medical standard .
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles at homes and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an additional charge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now built both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn to the South La@@ wn in the last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers will cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the data of the military , which were up to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the core of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 states .
apart from a yacht from Maine , a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ fts from Mississippi , it was shown in Connecticut .
the White House &apos;s military office demanded the presence of helicop@@ ters in an un@@ question@@ able order or fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South La@@ wn , following the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for operation of helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to its su@@ peri@@ ors , the deputy military commander for aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock and so long remained until the lawn was cleared from 18 : 00 to 21 : 00 in this evening .
the note adds , if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second team would be needed for the return flight .
during the event , the original flight at@@ titudes were during the event , while security personnel remained the unit during the time at the plane .
from the records of the TIM@@ E , records did not clearly indicate whether a second flight use was needed .
the Hatch Act prohi@@ bits federal government to use government property for political purposes .
dat@@ as@@ ets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could harm the determination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question that we found was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts , and we were informed of that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it sounds as if you are shut up , &quot; answered the Deputy Commander .
the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was described by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by Hatch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave a violation of the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and propag@@ ated efforts to contain@@ ment government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically favourable purposes .
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but your use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump led an investigation into the investigation as the presidential plane in front of the background of his first campaign R@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Ta@@ xi@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of messages which compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is thrilled by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy press @-@ saving of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn to susp@@ end the US President in the White House with precise cen@@ timet@@ able treasures .
as Tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House led 58 exercise land@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted among the training needs for the month , said a official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units were additionally held 11 hours on this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers were not the burden for any other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in charge the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to stakeholders from the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year , the DO@@ D award for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; records &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records notice the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House argue that the actual costs for the operation of helicop@@ ters are far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of revenues to determine is highly dec@@ ep@@ tive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in yearly means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study in 2015 , revenue sets for DO@@ D does not include the personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at this time , the former press premier@@ es of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of helicop@@ ters for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connecticut very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I expect hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it .
and I think , like most Americans we are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment , for which many Americans have been working ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course it is reasonable to empha@@ size this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with helicopter , as he entered his round about the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and talked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss front of tri@@ cky task
top fron@@ tr@@ unner in the second tennis @-@ Bundesliga joins the S@@ V tab at the table of the table .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss takes place tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel on the table of Table S@@ V .
despite five games still mac@@ er@@ os@@ er , the top @-@ runner of the second tennis Bundesliga has received the sense of reality .
team chef Mari@@ us Z@@ ay certainly has respect for his opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially at the rear positions I find the crew very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ j@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V , especially the imports from the high North .
&quot; whose Danish and Finn@@ s can even reject operations in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strongly in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , And@@ re Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ adic@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; it is as always hard for us .
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
it is the moment that the Ch@@ allen@@ ger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella is not a Bundesliga match for the Bundesliga game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) comes to its first deployment in this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ mad Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik Castillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ c An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski still at the ATP tournament in Kit@@ z@@ büh@@ el on Ball .
he should also be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ ow@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Julien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two wins last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster could also hit Má@@ té Val@@ cus again .
it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Junior World Ran@@ kings in January 2016 , anyone out of the trainer at Mari@@ us Z@@ ay will get the cad@@ res .
how America can harm the O@@ MV ?
truly happy , Donald Tr@@ ump does not , when on Wednesday evening , his signature made his signature under the law of tigh@@ tening the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his case , the law en@@ acted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress had a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional rules &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he corro@@ bor@@ ated a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels sh@@ amed against the US advance .
after all , the draft on pun@@ ishing European companies to help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines to the EU .
since then , investors are participating in O@@ MV &apos;s domestic O@@ MV , co @-@ financed jointly with other European companies in the construction of the Russian Ost@@ se@@ el@@ eventh North Stream 2 .
the dr@@ one is vast .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would still have to raise the sanctions via Executive Order to life .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has viewed , which the group could fight off and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put into the focal point of Net@@ fli@@ x .
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Killer has been unveiled , the net of Net@@ fli@@ x is not yet over .
the teams three and four were already confirmed by streaming services , the first received their first trailer and showed up the latest vill@@ ain .
with the third season , DE@@ A has the most successful organization of drug traff@@ icking in the world : the Cal@@ i cart@@ el .

Gil@@ berto Rodriguez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Damian Denis ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ells , Miguel Rodriguez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ as@@ ote ) is located in New York .

roll back@@ wards : the city presents 46 kitchen aid
the city organis@@ es the Kit@@ a mid@@ day back again .
with solid contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the municipal children &apos;s venues , the clock will be turned back .
on 1 September , the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the urban kinder@@ garten facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , assistant head in the field of youth welfare , this is good news : &quot; we were all very happy . &quot;
it is also cooked except house : a cat@@ erer takes this task and supplies fresh @-@ boiled cooled .
the city runs in the district of 46 day@@ care centres , in 44 the children get a warm meal .
in the last kit@@ ten year , 2,@@ 800 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who have taken care of 45 week@@ days at noon , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also available in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children remain until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 Par@@ ents of staff from 1 September kitchen staff : they heat the delivered food , add it to salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give the food , clean up , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the workers are assigned to a Kit@@ a , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as sevent@@ een tro@@ op groups - decides about the timet@@ able .
&quot; the kitchen heroes now belong to the Kit@@ a team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why it is : healthy food and cooking classes .
&quot; the children should help to prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen strength to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the Kit@@ a , a person who is familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the cleaning of the Kit@@ a rooms - so far the task of the kitchen staff - will be accomplished by special cleaning personnel .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm of cleaning and kitchen service , which , in comparison to the quality improvement of the kitchen capacity , which it turned out to the city as the most economic growth , means it from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the educational field not so strongly in weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of the society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , the Head of the Mission of the United Nations , said that hundreds of women are on the council elections in the provinces . three women can@@ di@@ ced for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women can &apos;t be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to contribute to managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in Glasgow plant .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company would weigh over the future of investment at the Toll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the work that produces other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea biscuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives will be &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities would change .
in a letter to the company , the company called the G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to say &quot; concerns said that the financing of production lines are not mandatory . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organizer Dre@@ w Duffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we can not gain clarity over the needs and investment plans for the future of Toll@@ ing , affects our members deeply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have been working here and labour force focus on the local community and the metrop@@ olitan Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social discrimination .
therefore , under the perspective of job creation , wage and prosperity , and from the background of Bre@@ xit , the increasing civil law cost and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow ur@@ gently need a thri@@ ving production development at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesperson for the Pla@@ in said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ pp@@ on@@ ites at Toll@@ cross did not receive a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to this , as we appreciate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at Toll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we are working in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , our business will continuously check - and that applies to all of our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our Toll@@ ing location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the heritage of Toll@@ ing as a production site full and completely . our business activities should change the site , employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the site of La League likes to regret your interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain did not leave in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar to em@@ it out an offer of £ 189 million in order to dissolve his free@@ wheel cl@@ ause , but they warned Barcelona three years ago .
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season .
following completion , N@@ ey@@ mar is the most expensive player in the world and for the highest paid pro athletes in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way that N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Board insi@@ sted that the club has always given its best to take care of him since its arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago from the PS@@ G president ?
when Manchester City 2014 are interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club to sign one of the best players from PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried anymore , because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will contact opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players , this will be consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , where the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G clearly stated that they would not allow it to go to the International from Italy in any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by having lost one of their price for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ es@@ atzen @-@ report ent@@ ails the Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ens@@ ity Dom@@ en@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; report to the abuse of Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ leading sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ aine La@@ atzen continues to offer discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sen@@ er , spokesperson for the reform movement , &quot; We are church , &quot; explained to the publication of the German press agency , he acquired by former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse .
it would very serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regre@@ ts about their own sub@@ mer@@ ings or their then wrong assessment of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican Chancellor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in contrast , critic@@ ised that during the reporting on violence with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in terms of advertising in Regensburg , nobody doubt that it would be prevented , &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds , &quot; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hab@@ it to describe the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and preparing public opinion on keeping it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bavarian Radio : &quot; we would like to go on the church and it &apos;s a flying fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , they pointed out that in their youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strokes a normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with friends as I was one to become ready . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they find it un@@ fair , today &apos;s setting standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse of mis@@ use , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who was published with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he considers the outcome of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is exactly what is written in the 440 @-@ page report which presented by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Domain atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 dom@@ es@@ rows are sexually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , it can hold fast that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. has been applied in many cases forms of physical and mental violence .
at high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ic , punishment for students could also be violent .
unlike many others , many victims are estimated that many victims were estim@@ ating the general humanity by R. and therefore in many cases , despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains how the final report on the dis@@ solution sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ es@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion has been reli@@ eved .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 pages report on the &quot; Incidents of Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ es@@ atzen &quot; is a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for instance , many students are lifting up his &quot; humanity . &quot;
in addition , it appears to be a Chol@@ eri@@ ker and Perf@@ ection , which became hand @-@ tan@@ gible , when a cathedral set brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you use this final report as its bi@@ ographer ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one needs to be wonder@@ ing why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is found in it at all .
it is just eight pages dedicated to him and he will clearly be acquitted of every sus@@ pic@@ ion of the Mitt@@ ens or Mit@@ wis@@ s in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the violence at the pre @-@ school occurred outside of its effectiveness .
it is possible to imp@@ ose it too late , of which too late or first att@@ ach@@ ments not taken seriously enough .
the Dom@@ es@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was experienced by practically all respondents as - as literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
so the vast majority of his student George R@@ atz@@ inger is also a very excellent report , describing him as a &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; professional , &quot; and &quot; understand@@ able , &quot; as extremely well @-@ nat@@ ured teachers who provided the boys regularly with cakes , cookies and bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always managed by grapes from children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ism , which also led to che@@ ut@@ ches .
that he didn &apos;t only cast on the floor with chairs and the key indi@@ ces on the ground , but also made ear @-@ celebrated guys from the hair or ears , he has already regre@@ t@@ ted himself years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for that .
to his honorary membership , however , we have to say that such educational methods in the fra@@ ming time , the 1960s and 1970s , were widely used , both parents and teachers .
do you know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone was born before 1968 .
I also experienced that in a world@@ ly school , a school high school .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the violence of violence on the pre@@ school , they are liber@@ ally excav@@ ators .
it is wonder@@ ing that it is not more likely to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ance and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , so many media has just stor@@ med him .
on the Bavarian Pope , many who never understood him are still eager to work .
but the truth is : the report de@@ bur@@ sed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the context of the report , the report was much about mis@@ use about mis@@ use at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ en@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger have been placed in the final report any settlement or complic@@ ity in terms of sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very much no .
no one of 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a covered representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the explanation of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they were not even familiar to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a cho@@ ir@@ master , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ es@@ atzen @-@ pupils R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role do with regard to the abuse of mis@@ stress ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student form@@ ulated : &quot; in regard of sexual abuse ... I see no case in which he would have had right away ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) could have had the right findings and could have been the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I hold it ... even for really absurd , assume that it was imp@@ ending ... Bu@@ bs in@@ sistent or even opened rather than opposite their parents , Internet conduc@@ tors , trust instruc@@ tors etc .
that one talks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in advance , affected students and / or their environment , in the context of the investigation , could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is un@@ shared by any collabor@@ ator .
therefore it cannot be accused of having hin@@ dered him , or to have brought him to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name to these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Non@@ violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ en@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; directions &quot; in the report .
do he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that in the coverage everything was mixed and men@@ ding to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that &apos;s exactly what is a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is clean separate , between the pre @-@ school and the high school of the Dom@@ en@@ atzen station , between sexu@@ alised abuse and violence as well as , let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other di@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the report deals with inci@@ dents from the time since 1945 , i.e. from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not Ch@@ oral director of the Dom@@ en@@ atzen .
all the aw@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were quite schi@@ z@@ oned and mal@@ nourished , all of them had to have occurred at the school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to have re@@ igns .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face as they were already at the cathedral .
on the same way , as the most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the subject &quot; Pre @-@ School &quot; tab@@ u .
one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ es@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence existed .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims were estim@@ ating the general humanity by R. and therefore in many cases , despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot;
so , at the most , the accus@@ ation remains , to have gone out .
but despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods where it was reported by the states on the pre @-@ school .
the first time 1970 / 71 when he had just begun to establish itself and from the predec@@ essors to a school where he had not worked and responsible , ( so the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again around 1993 .
en@@ oss Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , which is even re@@ produced by the report .
in this way , he conclu@@ des that &quot; in the school , the test penalty will continue to be practic@@ ed . &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press distribution , he recommended urgent action .
it was , of course , at a time , as legal clarity , as a test record was also forbidden in Bavaria .
before that , it occurred in a legal grey zone , as everyone knows of us .
there was also difficult for him , where those affected might be exagger@@ ated or dramatic and where really the permissible border had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say , he would have always looked away .
but that is not true .
only in 1980 , the test penalty was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria from Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed that it was un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to the times of time .
how do you see it ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we speak of histori@@ ans from the &quot; Fall@@ out of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger to evaluate the past today &apos;s moral measures .
the princ@@ ess has already quite right .
but this is true of course not for sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence to innocent children of children , that goes far beyond that time .
that &apos;s all very aw@@ ful and I &apos;m happy that it is finally getting started .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all this had nothing to do with him .
his funds for discipl@@ ines and punishment , i.e. ear@@ ths and ears to draw , were widespread in the 1970s .
when bo@@ di@@ ly punishment was forbidden , it has also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which image of his rainy days has given Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject of testing marks also in the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI tells his perspective , so the cathedral spar@@ rows played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I do not conce@@ al that he led a stric@@ ter regim@@ ent there .
but this also has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably hardly possible to form an institution of cat@@ tran@@ s , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with biscuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you do not have a big singer and no big singer and before every success , right on which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ este@@ em .
what kind of people have you experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks about their book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and ever experienced as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , fundamental , deep believing and hear@@ ty people , from which one can &apos;t imagine that he could do just a fly .
I &apos;m getting regularly with how many former Dom@@ spar@@ rows are still alive , 23 years after his emig@@ ration , regular contact with him to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him today , that he once was strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ aine atzen station are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , v@@ edic teacher , a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a loved resp@@ ect@@ ful , to which they still look today and honour her .
and please , once more clearly : all that you are presenting are educational methods that were at the time of the agenda .
we can be glad that we have overcome this time ago .
but it &apos;s very un@@ just , a man , just because it is promin@@ ently and an even more prominent brother to make the Mediterranean sin@@ ner .
there is the evil purpose that stands behind it , only too obvious .
because the report , which was just released , reli@@ eves him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the su@@ preme command would have purchased a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bay@@ erns and perhaps Germany would probably know not to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows , finally in peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
