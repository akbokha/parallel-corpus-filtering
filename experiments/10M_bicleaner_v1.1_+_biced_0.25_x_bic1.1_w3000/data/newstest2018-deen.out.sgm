<seg id="4">Small bandmen generate the one-day reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories at days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is nervous, when maps are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows what had to be exciting, because the car Navi was showing a green meadow instead of a ring road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportex Bavaria of the State Government, are all other than currently - yet very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current online-cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then, how cities and municipalities have changed in the distribution area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a Flickr carpet, which one recognizes as such as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">For cities and municipalities, detailed maps, so-called Urprisals, were born.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and from the first survey of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave an topographical survey of Bayerns on behalf - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops finally moved with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, the present neighbors, who created the idea of a wide-wide Bavaria-card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "KurfürstMax IV. Joseph drove the project forward, the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The Court of Munich dates from the year 1856 and is like all others on the Bavarian State library's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison list / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is lower-wling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, in 1877, as the Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today rests in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of the houses are concentrated in 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of the Bavarian farmers in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing but fields - at the first glance: when Hinschzooming appears a smaller map with dozens lines and numbers: handwritten notes from the so-called "jungle" from which the base tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are no farmers here today, but small farmers in the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is characterised by the north of sendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 scene of the October Revolution, was actually a meadow in the 19th century, and there was no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the urine paper, one reads in the area of today's au-Haidhausen, not just the street name "at the Gasteig," or by the Ange "On the ventilation" - but also in great letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one was locked once people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 there was the Munich Circle Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Lüders."</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden presided up the establishment - that psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended for example the chains of the so-called Irish." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he instructed the staff to apply violence against the passengers, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">It was first place for 280 patients, later extended to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity could not suffice - the reason for the construction of the Kreiserrendition in Hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatrists since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the area of the former Auer institution, young people meet in Munich's Salesium.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order bought the building complex in 1920, and turned him to a youth home with education.</seg>
<seg id="42">To the west is the football field of TSV Munich east, east residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in an architectural reference to the Department of Government of the Irrenanstalt who had been destroyed during the Second World War on bombing.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was" "" "main square" "" "in 1856, the Kaufstraße was named" "" "Kaufinger alley" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allied forces seized a lot of holes in the city center in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big stayed until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business houses and a tomb of the Middle Ages, once stood at the Marienhof, where these days are the preliminaries and the ground-breaking ceremony on 5 April 2017.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the shooting egler, the old Munich map can compare the aerial view of today's aerial view - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil law group publishes itinerary for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of Farming has issued a warning for colored people due to discriminating policies and the racist attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, who will go into force until 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians, as a number of questionable, racial-based incident at the last time can occur throughout the whole state and stated here," says it in the position of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent law of Missouri, which makes people harder to gain discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, who aim to disregard minority interests, prompted the group to publish the itinerary, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injury of civil rights, which happen to humans.</seg>
<seg id="55">They will be stopped due to their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency which we haven't heard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organisation has issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist fights against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances in the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and taken care of the police of Missouri by violating a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the General Office of Missouri by the fact that black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more common than white." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and staff know about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be willing, whether it will bring budgetary money or the relatives to travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's crime-report program, which ranks the state in terms of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The itinerary is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had adopted travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states that immigration laws have committed to violate people due to immigration cases, which will contribute to further investigation in the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Itineraries are generally issued by the State Department for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Crossover project is elementar</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary Group of the Peter White and Kordula Kovac were found in front of a picture.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the right yard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fishermen's fishing ban came together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially bestows insights into his farm in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows, and also many kittens and houses in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Schwarzwaldmilk" "" "is responsible for the milk of its cows, as swivents." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">In the table of the Feria, there is only regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">As he is also called BLHV-Chairman of Fisbach's fishing law, it is called "elementary project."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not generate momentous surfaces on derart.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green spaces should work for a lot of work, much has to be dealt with the engine sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have here with the terms and with the topography" "", "Schwendemann stressed." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the eleventh plant and bought these without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it does not lead to bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune recognized the meaning of the decimal project and is glad about the leader of the leader." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, the farmers had to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the capacity of the areas could still be moved quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have, the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how they continue to continue their operation," "" "says the Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often standing in criticism due to the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure surface is therefore 40 hectares, which are not permitted until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">For the total cost of 71 500 Euros, half of the leader was promoted, a quarter took the municipality of Fishbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">In this way, farmers have had to invest 12 610 Euro, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of fences," explained to Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do not make a really good job without farmers and landladies."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White: "here best foods are produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The rural areas of agriculture (lpr) Baden-Württemberg enables state-to-state support of Weidefences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is the revelations of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the lpr recorded funding.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the fenced area should not be worse (hangs over 35 per cent) and must be threatened by the cancellation.</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "for the 2018 fishing commercial project 2018 the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometers of fence." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">The disclosure surface corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking into the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The most secure sign of a regime change is to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as every other - hence the assorted overthrow of Saddam Hussein's Firdos in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the trump regime, knew surely what he did when he took a symbolic axe in an heat dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN via the president's drastic limitation with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller doesn't handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of the owners and Liberty-Imiters would have laughed at him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked their importance, and especially the importance that you were attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument he was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta decides, "I don't want to go to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty... a symbol of American freedom that enlightened the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer, which was later added and not part of the original statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively correct, but as he formulated it, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It's about the contemporary resonance on the touching words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "thy trash, your poor, and your thronged masses, who desire to breathe freely, and into the waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elting waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller does not engage in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict around the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death on the base, knew very good that they had completed a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American republicans, showing a classical painting representation of the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus altered this importance. in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she herself has a completely different name: mother of Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem by the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And as Lazarus had changed the importance of the statue, people wanted to change this from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great scream Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for coming from Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not to invite one but rather an early neoconservative, who bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "lady Liberty is moving.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torches should not enlighten the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Very unusual, Limbaugh is encountered here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the viewpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great phantasy indeed of Lazarus was in it, as they see from the exhausted, end, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys were seen on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It's in the true sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge, and have a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue says to them the words of hope, and of the welcome you must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective, the Miller and Trump will ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch shall not enlighten the way, but hatred, who is the only source of power to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black asks the Scottish members of the UK</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Schott belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of Scottish contingent will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland something special is being developed," and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn something.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "we welcome it, and we will try to understand and we will continue until we find it," "" "said Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type in the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medalists-candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butare, who have to compete against Sir Mo Farah while Eilidh Doyle, as captain of the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a series of athletes, whether they were Scottish or where ever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were highly motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh produced very natural were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, which will compete for their fifth world championships in the 400 m hurdle, says it's "incredible" that 16 Schott have been in the British crew.</seg>
<seg id="145">The world's best total number of athletes at the world championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-distance Muir leads to this path and has set up five British and two European records in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part to the 1,500 m and 5,000 metres of runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman that is to be observed after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">He remembers her first World Championships, when the only other Scotsman was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their fellow countrymen do not only belong to the team, but in some cases even with the medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing to be team chapters, is that it was a great honor anyway, but to know that my team mates have voted for me and chose me, making it something special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to climb at Posts.</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So, it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out and compete, and it will simply be a great atmosphere there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of critics via Facebook: don't get a public office if you do not wear the preheat of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long until the newspapers struck him because of all, from the domestic policy up to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He shy at the critique, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics into silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783 Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb we are led to the slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland Larry Hogan who needs to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people, and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union lamented him for this reason.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff left the lawsuit as a frivol, and the online commentary was full of a counterreaction with "Na," and?. "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishing popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors in the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillfully sent to use Facebook as primary funds to link with his voters and to debate his hair-loose head to chemotherapy in his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the page of the Governor - which is a public forum, which is officially designated as officially called and by employees who are paid with public tax-Dollars - unnecessarily and finally dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Interspokesperson Amelia Chasse denied the actions of the Governors and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too simple to use the image of cast or spammers or horts filled people online the whips online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail spoke with some of the actual people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, MD, was not fulfilled, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented, that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other recent news," "" "she wrote in the commentaries of the message" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't appreciate this idea when a number of people entitled to the same topic, then they will be abused by some rather than a so-called collective use and is not recognized as a large group of people affected." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">What the governors awarded as "concentrated Spam Attack" would probably be called "intercession."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to share a message by blocking one critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous time when you had the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical ladles to burn, burn, or bring demonstrators to silence and to silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly that happens just digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials, who criticises his Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused by Twitter users who blocked his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question occurred last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violates the First Achievment, according to the U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they named a elector from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Prein (R) received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers watched between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters beat upon his guidance.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all the letters to papers, which caused Washington decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions which criticised his position on the treaty of Amity, the trade and navigation of the United Kingdom, criticised his office, according to the historic documents published by the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he didn't have it to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of expression, disagreements, and discourses belong to our nation's basis.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche on the old cemetery-area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16 at 16.30 am invited to a serenade.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether his idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hilarius plant a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the Sixth Benefiz-Serenade can be enchanted from this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">Salvation and preservation of the oldest building in the resort have made friends and conveyors of tumours about their intentions.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasises: "it's a unique sweet little odine."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, St. Hilariuskelle was mentioned for the first time in the Württembürgical certificate, Count Hermann of Sulz, and the Vogtei "at Magister Eberhard by Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the origins of the certificate on the Tumlinger hill, there was also a magnificent courtyard, which belonged to the church, or the patron saint, and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">There were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, beside the undervillage and the Oberdorf, which today in the village of Tumlingen was still visible, the "mountain" of the third, the magnificent settlement center of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around the year 1600 were underminted these historical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="476">The patroneous arose from the early medieval yolfactory law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A lord who built a church, and occupied with a pastor, remains the owner of this church, and could also inherit these self-monks.</seg>
<seg id="478">Thus, the right to use a minister, or to suggest the bishop for a new priest.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells in the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greatest of the two towers to Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rocked for the first time in 1692, but had to be left later in 1942 in the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows are wrapped and the bell rack were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was undense.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and the churchyard, they used it as a firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remnants of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead out of hearing.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the HilariusChurch was broken.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the steeple was made.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's eight 1834, a storm split the steeple and the half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was broken off.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only today's existing Turmzwerg remained the witness of the 750-year old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem take care of the "creative pension" as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organizer, the friends and promoter of tumours on Sunday, July 16, the sixth serenade on the old cemetery at St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler high school in Freudenstadt and with essays by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">The centre of Hartmut Romann talks the closing word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 15.30.</seg>
<seg id="499">The Serenade horrible takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view over meadows up to the woods," the organizers provide the fantastic view.</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade takes place only at dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers now hope for many supporters to the obtaining of the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is of significance for Tumlingen and hearing.</seg>

<seg id="505">"Boisheim" honor "is not a legal requirement for construction and has therefore turned to the land rat.</seg>
<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim are instructed" by Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Nisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines would have been approved, as at the time in quadruding, only at the border line to Schwalmtal exists a wind force concentration zone.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind power plants are basically possible, but at the same time, the concentration zone causes wind energy use for the rest of the city area.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are supposed to prevent a "saving" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">Although the town of Viersen had decided a second wind turbine zone in the Boisheimer Nette - but they had not been approved by the Düsseldorf district of Düsseldorf, because of a formula.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "due to the lack of planned legal requirement is the granted authorization to proceed as before illegal and because of this," "" "Christoph Erkens, Chairman of" "" "Boisheim" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="513">The current state of things: the Stadthalle covered the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a approval of the district government is still standing.</seg>

<seg id="519">With a view of the proceedings at the administrative court, the circle on Thursday was not willing to express itself in terms of the reasoning of the association "Boisheim."</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning on an area at the Boisheimer Nette the construction of four each 200 metres high wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="521">Already last year, the company, in which the town of Viersen, is involved in the city of Viersen, closed Pachtcontracts with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the establishment of the four wind power plants, the power demand for around 11 400 households should be covered - this is equivalent to around one-fifth of all four-seniors.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer there were a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Windpark Linnich in Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="544">In addition, customer potential should be re-opened or re-opened.</seg>

<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is simultaneously nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80-person years, for the 90-year-years Grunge era (as the pioneer David Wain and Michael Showage), and for himself - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to larger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artefact it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But when franchise feels like that, the time would be scarcely.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd lobs (it contained a original history for an attractive box vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>

<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost its virginity yet.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy-malignant plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showage) is included, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-successful impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the courses are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It makes a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's lower moustache of "singles" whose ex-Man-on-Camp Andy is now feeling like an old hacker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It is the moments of accidental madness that could heat this franchise as a type of repetitive "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I will show as its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: twenty Years Later," whose last scene the band will show how to visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>

<seg id="1204">And the list of the famous spokesman - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - ensures a decent play 'Finde the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer that carries a Reagan mask, is included - often as a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes, it turns off, and the comedy is not fast or frequently enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"comrade Detective," which has been edited on a smaller length, could only deliver his agitprop-satire, as Gregor and Iosef once again attend the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who devour a heap of hamburgers.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps of new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the pretenment of the presidents.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new staff of the White House plans to limit the information flow to President Trump - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">When John F. Kelly, who met new staff of Staff of the White House, on his first working day with executive employees, he portrayed a major problem in president Donald Trumps White House, which he wants to repair: poor information that got into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information should flow on him - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring its media grounds.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship with television lasts for decades - and now, where he is at the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "when the Trump had annoyed because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to convince him that he had received a fair coverage of places that were to convince" "" "said the former election campaign Sam Nunberg in February to POLITICO." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep the trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officers to ensure that his personal media consumption has a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit ever "was" under control, "is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this campaign officials know something that we don't know others - that Trumps tweets would have not contain any additional ignition material without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We'll probably never know anything about tweets that Trump does not broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff had given him some times, trouble away from him, then their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has to prevent it consistently that Trump controversy evokes.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people put together in a White House that sets itself out of competing parties, always trying to present their own agenda by presenting the trump material that might help their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of consultants, President of strategic reasons and desperate information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmakers:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former trump officials say that Trump can react to negative press excerpts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he may find out where these originate from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly that happened at the end of February when somebody unwilled a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff in Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of" in the White House. "</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was banned because of Schicans permanently from Twitter, or that he had offered no concrete evidence, or that it expressed false allegations in the past and has resisted them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask staff about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmakers added that the staff of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage paper and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Priebus but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive to influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchanging factors make Kellys Mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1480">In Russia's affair, US president Donald Trump is supposed to have started a special Jury by Robert Mueller after a report called Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The panel recorded the work in recent weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" under appeal to the matter.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper clears the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded its investigations and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN reported that there are already pre-charges of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian attorney.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence accuses the Kremlin to have targeted targeted targeted in the presidential campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were demolition between Truman election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of investigations, several men should stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to report, Mueller also took more and more trumps private and business environment among the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The Washington Post, "wrote a couple of weeks ago that the special mediator Trump personally sent to the center and undergo the accusation, if the president may have hindered justice in the wake of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand jurys is to examine and decide evidence in possible accidents and decide whether charges should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys will therefore also be called arbitrary chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">They are mostly switched on if it is larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always closed behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be switched on by the Prosecution to invite people to interrogation under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the transmitter CNN, pre-charges have already been issued to turn the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian attorney.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr. there were also Trumps consultant and son-law Jared Kushner and his damaging election campaign Paul Manafort with the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in U.S. TV, that the suspension will show that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that he should be necessary quickly to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, for the opening of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump.</seg>

<seg id="1505">These work, however, usually work in secret, he emphasized.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House fears all measures that accelerated the work of the Sonderkomer in "faire" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that not to be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">You have no reason to assume that something changed, it was further stated in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only used after Trump comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this rapprochement, accusations against Trump had become loud, he tried to hinder the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before a Senate committee, Trump asked him to investigate the investigations against the then national security adviser, Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President is under a large pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After portrayal of US media, the White House gathered material against the special mediator and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This solved speculation about whether Trump Mueller wants to be released.</seg>

<seg id="1519">In the Western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has loosened from the nearly seven-fold size of Berlin from the Schelleis.</seg>
<seg id="1520">The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institut for Polar- and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The more than one trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres of large Koloss throw now to the north and will probably take two, three years until it melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It is one of the biggest Iron Maiden in the past three decades, with 175 kilometers length and a width of up to 50 kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1524">As a consequence of climate change, climate change played a role in the demolition of the iceberg, according to research data is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, there have been a series of unusual contours in the region for around 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a facsimile background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In the opinion of many researchers, it could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken Koloss was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelleis so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelleis floats on the sea and is fed by great glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow further into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelhütte is situated south of South America, almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this elfeelisk, the balance of waxes and abrupture was disturbed some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete towel will fall there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is some evidence that the Larsen-C-Schelleis are in danger, because the front edge had never been withdrawn as far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate also stands under tension and can fall, if at a key point a piece is aborted.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelleis and iceberg not increase the sea level as they swim out on the water and pushed ice as much water as it comes after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of Schelfeises leads to the glaciers directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">It could possibly increase sea level, but only in a small degree, the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">After AWI-C, the Larsen-C-Schelleis is the fourth largest shuts of Antarctica after AWI.</seg>
<seg id="1539">On the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, on the front edge to the open ocean some 200 metres.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There breaks it regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although there is a natural creature and no direct connection to climate change is aware, the iron sign is now in a dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the most extensive retreat since the start of the record," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Under scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen-C-Schelcelebrate again grow or return in the long term, and possibly coincidentally, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these researchers do not return the abrupture of this gigantic iceberg, in recent decades, however, many ircuddle of the Antarctic Peninsula have been deplagued by the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long zipper of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The temperature increase has contributed to the decline.</seg>

<seg id="1796">He became a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions of drought, and because of the disease-borne insects, scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, which can try to find great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert on the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effective because the plant in recent years was exposed to the effects of climate change, which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the life span of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cicade, a microbacteria, the dwarf of zipped, and with very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>

<seg id="1802">Lavender oil is not just perfect for holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "rather than very long plant watches with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either damaged or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">Among the solutions that are considered, a better water distribution and the slowdown of the evaporation of the ground, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of flavours that are resistant to dryness.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The weekly staff of the weekly Riodoce meet in Wednesday to review their plans for the reporting on the youngest chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt civil servants and unaudible drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists are discussing what feels safer: they are supposed to take their kids to the office, which were the goal of an attack with grenades or to leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a plate at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">You pray the reporters, names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feelings rich.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drugs dingggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the secret list of government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no rest of the violence, and while in all the country the corpses, there are still more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under attack and threats from Bundesschutz und until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter you are the editor and her incarator of Riodoce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence will be deeply felt, even though his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his medieval finger with the word "Justice," he hangs on the facade of the Riodoce 'building. two reporters in the thirties, with Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wearing T-shirts, which show his smelling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters are discussing their shared issues, the trauma, her nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special prosecutor was built in 2010 in order to edit the cases of journalists, this committee, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, has only initiated two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders that are associated with drug trafficking and organic crime each year, the killers of journalists are only rarely provided by journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are intraterally east and even though the terrain is still avenger.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting has little benefit to the discussion of security, Ibarra says.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid, my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we do not know why, we mistrust all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15 Valdez left the Office of the Riodoce newspaper in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away, before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with "Tweld River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to go free in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is practically nothing to be silent about Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans, last year and the surrender to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, since rival factions are struggling to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of buried, two-story mausoleums for drug-goats, which are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes two misconceptions contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, there were publication of an interview with Damo Lopez, a leader of a rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzmans's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gangcrew bought every copy of the output when she was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez, after the capture of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country to his own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing will be considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues believed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he merged with five colleagues at the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, it was impossible to run journalism without having to violate the antidote problem, "Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1847">At the time, the newspaper served a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and turnover and advertising recorded.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it, hard to publish studies without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that nobody else could be treated.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot award" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drug history, where ever it led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily, that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ." ""</seg>

<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked," "" "What have you done so much of death? why did you not say what went before?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the Spaak bird, who was like a dockworkers, who was generous with hugs and ratchet, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always be to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, go to the same table there.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love toward the routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to ask her own assumptions about how to do their work on the best and to stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it when you are dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, home runways," "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.</seg>

<seg id="1866">When it comes wrong, you stay away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing with Javier is happening."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa no longer - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smuters, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>

<seg id="1871">Two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a mid-class building in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in scherz, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen, who described governor himself as not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug-subjects are under control under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has clicked on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state spending, focusing on the hometown of the governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the State Office, conducted a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped, or how it happened, so it was advisable to write as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), who ruled all political plains all over the century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-term corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman went to a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the readers would have considered the column of Valdez as the best informed source of kidnapping.</seg>

<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers that protesting against the killings of journalists, because the staff had become something that they have never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the Office of the State Plan.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western State of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become more powerful throughout the country by organized protests in the "SOS Press" protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="1891">This day the director Bojorquez is gone to Washington and is trying to collect international support for the judiciary in Valdez's case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">In a meeting with Governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spelling journalists and kill them because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since then asked that it is divided again from the government because it is concerned that their anger has hurt its objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico have been organised by organizational crimes, involved in government officials and a equality society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that reporters did not only be killed by drug interiors, but also on orders from politicians and security forces, which stoned with organised crime under a blanket.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armoured plant-eaters is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine close to Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada, dug on 21 March 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He hit something that seemed to the surrounding rocks at Platze, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent into the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy soil.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the ready result is now ready to be unveiled.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you are only blind with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main actor Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is visible.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"" "" "" "it will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs copies - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this plant-eaters, although it is covered with a armor, and resembles a rolling tank, probably threatened by meat-carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly armoured dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage, to hide themselves from predators, and used a paratroopers that is known as a counterbalance, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to mix himself better into its surroundings and to soften his enemies, experts, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creation from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines in May and is now shown in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and there is Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed it to extract Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and armaments over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shaded, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the head of the creature was darker than its bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the condensation is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta is by far the surviving animals live.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs have been hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs, that the evolution of the confrontation of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the counter-shaded - think of Rehe, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable as a prey, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily broken dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs have to have been the chalk time," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists will continue to examine the animal on evidence of his life, including his overall performers to find out what it had eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs died when he died, into a river, and driven into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At this time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland as they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is covered completely with preserving skin but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal." Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal today looks like almost as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use fantasy to reconstruct it. if you only have a little bit with the eyes, you could think that he is sleeping in sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when giant Theropoden, carnivorous dinosaurs, stood on two legs, crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after the Boreopelta, the armored dinosaurs was chased out of some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, their latest findings in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sank after the death in the sea and in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium Mine close to Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada, dug on 21 March 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum it is the preserved Dinosaurs in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips which were rained by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armoured plant-eaters was pushed by western Canada until the flooded river was flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater splendor of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so good, that the Hautread still covers more holised armoured plates along the dinosaurs</seg>

<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" is called by train the ticket rankings without a conductor.</seg>
<seg id="1999">In order to use this, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to booked an online ticket - what most passengers do already anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">You have to have bought it via the app, DB Navigator, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last one needs a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: one gets into the train, calls his ticket under "My Ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2004">The test customers will then appear a button to electronic discharge.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train drivers get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is located in the train and has taken the booked seat space Y.</seg>

<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep silent.</seg>

<seg id="2011">Second Plus: "and our employees have more time than today to go to individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">Anyone who often travels, knows that in addition to delay and missed trains, the ticket controls are one of the greatest assessments.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often, in any case, one of the co-travelers don't have all the documents that you need for the devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either is missing the credit card or identity card or any document that you need to point.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result are endless discussions between migrating heads and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the part or greater space and delays in control of your own tickets and the conductor at the end time takes to take care of other concerns.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to study the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken by her core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after having arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis Geborene on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which they rented and scrollers through Facebook on their phone.</seg>

<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retched on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policemen in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>

<seg id="2031">There was photos of the police tape and people, the screaming, and from a man who claimed to be Browns's father who had a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson police have just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed, where a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a flap dog.</seg>

<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6-year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two will go to Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protests, love and losses, strength and resistance, which consists of the point of view of the people who have filled in community and have filled the streets to ask answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell with her daughter, wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, came to Ferguson, talking the two conversations that they had countless times ahead of this morning, "over the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight with what they believe?" "" "remember what she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="2047">It must know, and you'll see it and it will be tracked up.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution, and what we need to do to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I'm lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not have any vlatant racism, it is not different than the next black women.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel that I would prove her a bad service to keep them away from it. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place across the police station, which became a camping area when activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter have joined a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets, and helped to pass on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began a new kind of activism for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed after 9 August," she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "everything has come." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to only "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came to Ferrell:" "" "will you be documented or try to find a story you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism has been nourished by countless cases of people, often of White - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Follow in an interview: "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan already worked together with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism around Todestract occupants.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment was brought closer to Ferrell's project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after browns creation.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"" "" "" "this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us." "" "said Davis." ""</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me, as these people will be depicted, for so shall I be presented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">"" "" "" "the aim was not to concentrate on Ferrells experience - to show that it is" "" "not around a Messiah leaders, but for a community that comes together," "" "said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film." ""</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" the personal aspects of Ferrells lives as she loves and marry her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understand that there must be certain vulnerability in this work and with the goals of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">Furthermore, Ferrells's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who had stamped the film "Blacklivre Matter" after the killing of the black teenage matchment in 2012, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and we are constantly fighting for different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insists that "this is not a affirm type of action," where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person responsible for this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it is no coincidence, although she was at the forefront, because in a life at these cruises as a black, gay woman stands so much on the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile the news cameras in Ferguson have gone long ago, but the racist links between the community and police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years due to blocking an autobahn at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos".</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless they appealed to a singing and she feels committed to that memory since three years ago in Ferguson, on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, although it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the Süver of pedestrian precinct since the first presentation of 2009 has its support in supporters and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the topic cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The theme is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the one-bit gallery says: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be real class" (Nicole Scots), comes from the other side: "no human being" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "size!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocates build on that a gallery will attract more customers in the city, of which the other businesses are benefiting, fear that the pedestrian street is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Added: the gallery is planned precisely on the property, on which the farmers market stands on, in the 13 direct marketing their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction, it will be completed.</seg>

<seg id="2109">You see how many shop shops are empty here - some have been within months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is more important that at least the market stands remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there is fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer and is also cheap.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop shops are rented in a shopping center only of larger firms, because the local tenets are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special stores there is almost no more and what is left, then will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where is the peasant market place during the building time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even when the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it already create the Spectst bit gallery before, to drive out all the shops of Bitburg? "</seg>

<seg id="2124">An appropriate similarity: artist creates portrait with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost invisible as they are hanging from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks and hair cut, which you were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst entered a 35-year sentence after completing diplomatic consultations on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition that opened on 2 August is A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was united in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and landmark dissidents, was converted to condemnation by Barack Obama as he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg was created by the algorithm analysis of the DNA that could look from Manning and out of the 30 portraits, such as anyone can be interpreted with these genomic data, the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already talked about the identification as a woman, has been sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Due to the prison their image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white Selfie, in which Manning sits visibly on a driver's seat and carries a platinblond wigs - with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist portraits of foreigners from forensic Artefacts like cigarette stalls and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture how these people might look like this.</seg>
<seg id="2135">It was the time that she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>

<seg id="2137">And she could not visit this time and could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated muse were unhappy briefferings, who ruled several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo Illustriped comic "Supported Images," which would foresee a future in which the president Chelated Judgement would convert and it would be able to see the exhibition himself.</seg>
<seg id="2140">The fact that Obama was actually just a few days after the book was released, Manning was just calling for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of happy reunion.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also in the opening of the exhibition some deep and Starkes, as Donald Trump leads a war against informant from the government camp and to find new, tweetable ways to stop the rigid divisions which he actually should fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things are going to happen for a specific reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for Manning with their oversized signature (the "i" in their family name is provided with a heart) an end of the "automatic crash site, whose foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide based on the high-developed scientific Lexicon of the artist), as astonishingly similar, at least in biological ways, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people will hope to take away is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are," "" "Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also shown." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a page from the top-mentioned comic novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning as she emerges as King Kong with a free slide show in the United States of the United States as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they chill your speech, then they have won."</seg>

<seg id="2155">This was also targeted as everything in the exhibition, until size (5 "2, Manning Stature), where her genetic hapers were written with pencil.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze-music video and was a gorges for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-he and 1980-he years.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history in the Conscious River valley in Kent and now is the inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mopolitan Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says blamed.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England's spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scotney - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he found unexpectedly.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"" "" "" "I just got on the thumb pressure on the side of a letter which was written by a dual agents in the 1700-s who worked for the Jacobins," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2298">"that is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell as smoke, because they kindled a fire because of light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect when he himself would.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is involved with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have been a little overrated") this seems to be true to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodos spent his days to explore the Victorian "new" castle, to study the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, like the monstroked angled buttons on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trenches.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He emigrated through the area and the ruins of the old castle, and spoke with Landscapes, gardener, and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, he drank "Whiskey and started writing."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust got the full access in 2006, when the last Eram, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees began to take care of the archive, which he said as "hundreds of years, in which aristocrats said" Oh, put it on the loft. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of English Empire, maps, which would pose that which possessed: "one could mean that country conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch who fought two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let everything go ahead! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to fill on a wider basis into the English history, including 'The Labourer', which leaves a man, who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer's figure of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a riot that appeared in 1380 in the castle, in this book with the title 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the farmer began in this area and I thought a revolt was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are connected together? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patrons, the family Darrell ran for seven years in the English Reformation hidden.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', portrayed in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century, portrayed his own funeral (a discovery that was made only years later when his sarg was dug up).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes "favorite family of Scotney:" the gentlemen seemed to be a great Gauner, getting debts and spending money for things that they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell-men loose their school crises by giving up rich old women - I imagine it as a heap of good-looking guys, with a talent to advertise landlocked. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his approach in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique screaming experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elderänki, the grounds of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been demanded from nature again.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Anyway, the bulk of the army in the army and security forces goes on anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan sent a further 7395 power operators, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan was tamed up the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals are earlier than the true masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times, they were under appeal to their role as sentinels of state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan rejected the power of the military step by step, not least by calling for reform of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan is managing targeted an Islamization of the armed forces.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that 2017 may not be reprocessed in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robot.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose eyelash of the robot, its shape of nipples and type of fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are funny about them, but the companies deliver any quantity of it, and we will get much more common to see," Mr Sharkey said the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone membrane which feels warm - with consciously human reactions to be achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also customize its robot according to its beliefs, "and select everything from the color of the robot via the shape of breast cancers to type or colour of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But there is still worrying as many robots have the "personalities" who would look like a Stepford-woman progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed to robots with a silicone membrane.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example to adjust its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they will be pleasing such as schooling.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the Roxxxy Gold sex robot with pre-programmed individuals such as "Frigid Farrah" who conveys the impression of schooling and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that has been adapted as good as possible," warms the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you do not like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, it also has its moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It can be tired to be fixed in conversation or she can be "in the mood!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many worrying aspects of this rise of Sex-robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subways of female properties, the incentives on rape, when you take a step on Frigid (means here: resisting) Farrah is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website true True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" it's on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and their growing refinement show a little darker and deeper deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the Ideal of Gender equality to a desire for sex with underpation as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men are of course not holding sex robots, while FRR notices its rising popularity, they still remain in the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leakened out of the boundary, can be in terms of the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offensive, up to them the free market gives the permission.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney for the epitome of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a Binsenweary of the trump-era that the political divisions, which have polarized the US voters that have split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA newspapers with advice about how to circumvent with the horror of trump-chosen relatives.</seg>

<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-left poet, who lives in Chicago, has long lived with the republicans in our family for a long time, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">They reminded me that the unity could have a mighty effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the republican relationship, having fought for decades of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to make the dining table, this certainly is a good thing, but it falls to me in another connection that this also brings significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The Left has been strengthened by Trump, but the effective effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "Normalisation" and trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that his mittens will not get rid of one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is still a frightened long-term scenario, in which Trump republicans of the right wing is "normalized" which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as the epitome of asonableness.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the decline - the dog on the car level, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax statement looked) - both in comparison with trump in fact occur in a very mild straftaten.</seg>

<seg id="2443">The Central Park Karusel is still a strange magical experience, as here two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have checked the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one has asked.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study asserts just the opposite: a diet that is rich in flesh-based proteins and dairy products could be the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and Britain, causes stomach cramps and blotings, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During those affected, researchers are advised to avoid meat and dairy products to prevent their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan found to develop immune cells that promote immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestines patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hide in the body does not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are inherent to determine inflammation, are balanced by cells, which promote tolerance and protect the body, without damage to sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation, it may result in an anti inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it was found that a kind of tolerance enhancing immune cell in mice, which carry a particular bacterium in their innards.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbioms, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan rich nutrition can be tolerated, less flammable intestinal milieus, when the same system looks at humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral fellow Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was seeking a type of immune cells that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study of study such cells had, but another group of the same tribe, which was separated, this was not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They presumed that the difference was to do with the intestinal microbiomen of the mice, the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of the mice were DNA sequenced and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells, but without it were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they were not lacked a gut microbiom and they did not have developed these kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria reacted to the immune system, the researchers sent L. reuteri in a liquid and then carried small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant tolerating cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned out of liquid, it proved itself as a byproduct of tryptophan-metabolism, known as Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant properties like mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri are developing the cells at humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines." ""</seg>

<seg id="2864">The site of La League likes to regret your interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain did not leave in their persecution of Neymar to emit out an offer of £189 million in order to dissolve his freewheel clause, but they warned Barcelona three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand, Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the last season.</seg>
<seg id="2867">Following completion, Neymar is the most expensive player in the world and for the highest paid pro athletes in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious about the way that Neymar has forced his way out outside, although a source near the Catalans Board insisted that the club has always given its best to take care of him since its arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned three years ago from the PSG president?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City 2014 are interested in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for each club to sign one of the best players from PSG.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I'm not worried anymore, because they know that if they touch one of our players, we will contact opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.</seg>
<seg id="2872">"we respect all the clubs.</seg>
<seg id="2873">But if they try to sign one of our players, this will be consequences. "</seg>
<seg id="2874">Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line, where the Spanish association expressed interest in the PSG-midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.</seg>
<seg id="2875">PSG clearly stated that they would not allow it to go to the International from Italy in any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by having lost one of their price for Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misleading scandal at the Regensburger Domaine Laatzen continues to offer discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weissener, spokesperson for the reform movement, "We are church," explained to the publication of the German press agency, he acquired by former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would very serve the prestige of the Catholic Church when Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regrets about their own submerings or their then wrong assessment of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican Chancellor" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "in contrast, criticised that during the reporting on violence with the" "" "two measures" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">In terms of advertising in Regensburg, nobody doubt that it would be prevented, "shameful and shameful deeds," but the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit to describe the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of everyday experience and preparing public opinion on keeping it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bavarian Radio: "we would like to go on the church and it's a flying fresco."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "in addition, they pointed out that in their youth" "" "strokes a normal pedagogical means" "", "" "" "to be done with friends as I was one to become ready." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They find it unfair, today's setting standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse of misuse, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who was published with Ratzinger the "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he considers the outcome of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What is exactly what is written in the 440-page report which presented by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domain atzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s." "" "victims of overprint, 67 domesrows are sexually abused." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "in summary, it can hold fast that Domkapellmeister R. has been applied in many cases forms of physical and mental violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">At high Emotionic, punishment for students could also be violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Unlike many others, many victims are estimated that many victims were estimating the general humanity by R. and therefore in many cases, despite violence even positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains how the final report on the dissolution scandal at the Regensburger Domesatzen Georg Ratzinger in his opinion has been relieved.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440 pages report on the "Incidents of Violence of Violence at the Regensburger Domesatzen" is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For instance, many students are lifting up his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">In addition, it appears to be a Choleriker and Perfection, which became hand-tangible, when a cathedral set brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you use this final report as its biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one needs to be wondering why the name Georg Ratzinger is found in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">It is just eight pages dedicated to him and he will clearly be acquitted of every suspicion of the Mittens or Mitwiss in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violence at the pre-school occurred outside of its effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It is possible to impose it too late, of which too late or first attachments not taken seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domesatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was experienced by practically all respondents as - as literally - "salvation," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">So the vast majority of his student George Ratzinger is also a very excellent report, describing him as a "warm-hearted," "professional," and "understandable," as extremely well-natured teachers who provided the boys regularly with cakes, cookies and bonbons and "always managed by grapes from children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about its perfectionism and its high Emotionism, which also led to cheutches.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he didn't only cast on the floor with chairs and the key indices on the ground, but also made ear-celebrated guys from the hair or ears, he has already regretted himself years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for that.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his honorary membership, however, we have to say that such educational methods in the framing time, the 1960s and 1970s, were widely used, both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced that in a worldly school, a school high school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violence of violence on the preschool, they are liberally excavators.</seg>
<seg id="2926">It is wondering that it is not more likely to do with his acquaintance and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, so many media has just stormed him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian Pope, many who never understood him are still eager to work.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report debursed Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the context of the report, the report was much about misuse about misuse at the Regensburger Domenatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger have been placed in the final report any settlement or complicity in terms of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very much no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to speak with my father or my mother," "" "said a covered representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the explanation of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they were not even familiar to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choirmaster, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domesatzen-pupils Ratzinger's role do with regard to the abuse of misstress?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated: "in regard of sexual abuse... I see no case in which he would have had right away (Georg Ratzinger) could have had the right findings and could have been the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I hold it... even for really absurd, assume that it was impending... Bubs insistent or even opened rather than opposite their parents, Internet conductors, trust instructors etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus, the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that in advance, affected students and / or their environment, in the context of the investigation, could not be confirmed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">Regarding sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is unshared by any collaborator.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Therefore it cannot be accused of having hindered him, or to have brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name to these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media there was a lot of" "" "Nonviolence" "" "at the Regensburger Domenatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of "directions" in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that in the coverage everything was mixed and mending to a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that's exactly what is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"" "" "" "there is clean separate, between the pre-school and the high school of the Domenatzen station, between sexualised abuse and violence as well as, let's say," "" "other diaries." ""</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, i.e. from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not Choral director of the Domenatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the awful test pedagogy, the cases where the boys of sadistic teachers were quite schizoned and malnourished, all of them had to have occurred at the school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous states have to have reigns.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face as they were already at the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the same way, as the most witnesses emphasise, the subject "Pre-School" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domesatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence existed.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims were estimating the general humanity by R. and therefore in many cases, despite violence even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So, at the most, the accusation remains, to have gone out.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods where it was reported by the states on the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time 1970 / 71 when he had just begun to establish itself and from the predecessors to a school where he had not worked and responsible, (so the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Enoss Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of Domspatzengymnasium, which is even reproduced by the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this way, he concludes that "in the school, the test penalty will continue to be practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press distribution, he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">It was, of course, at a time, as legal clarity, as a test record was also forbidden in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, it occurred in a legal grey zone, as everyone knows of us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was also difficult for him, where those affected might be exaggerated or dramatic and where really the permissible border had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say, he would have always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">But that is not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria from Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the times of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we speak of historians from the "Fallout of Anachronism," so the danger to evaluate the past today's moral measures.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is true of course not for sexual abuse, which was abhorred at all times, and not for what was broken in the preschool of resistance and violence to innocent children of children, that goes far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all very awful and I'm happy that it is finally getting started.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, for all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His funds for disciplines and punishment, i.e. earths and ears to draw, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When bodily punishment was forbidden, it has also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which image of his rainy days has given Georg Ratzinger because in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of testing marks also in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI tells his perspective, so the cathedral sparrows played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not conceal that he led a stricter regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly possible to form an institution of cattrans, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and Bonbons alone, you do not have a big singer and no big singer and before every success, right on which area, but always discipline, passion and self-esteem.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced Georg Ratzinger in the talks about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I met Georg Ratzinger really well and ever experienced as a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep believing and hearty people, from which one can't imagine that he could do just a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I'm getting regularly with how many former Domsparrows are still alive, 23 years after his emigration, regular contact with him to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him today, that he once was strictly speaking to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domaine atzen station are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, vedic teacher, a strict father, certainly that may be - but also a loved respectful, to which they still look today and honour her.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once more clearly: all that you are presenting are educational methods that were at the time of the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it's very unjust, a man, just because it is prominently and an even more prominent brother to make the Mediterranean sinner.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil purpose that stands behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report, which was just released, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">"" "" "" "now the supreme command would have purchased a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bayerns and perhaps Germany would probably know not to know the Regensburger Domsparrows, finally in peace." ""</seg>
