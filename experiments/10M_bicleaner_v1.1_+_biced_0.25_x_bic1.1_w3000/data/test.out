Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are ob@@ struc@@ tible .
at the end of a golf tournaments in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger visited a little variety of variety with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered her holiday evening , they pursued in the fast gal@@ lop home to the feeding .
a kilometer at this pace , I &apos;m afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and there@@ with , the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was best ever - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
he left himself with his family over the facility of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he sw@@ elled not to create a photo .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid handed out the man from An@@ hausen in the course of a small gala in the Golden sport pyramid .
there is no awards to awards to the sympath@@ etic athl@@ ete .
Federal Foreign Office , silver bay leaf , Champions @-@ Tour player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already led him .
the 18th prize lau@@ re@@ ates of the sport pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize of Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this distinction means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for she will not only be awarded for spor@@ tive successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since decades , Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 further outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time U.S. mast winner was captured on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot;
the instruc@@ tors belong to the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ ck and Harald Schmit@@ t , der Turner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ ves , the Ru@@ i Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Le@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the jumping Al@@ win Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the hand of hand Erhard .
many of these sporting events came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the lively community mig@@ rated to the Spring@@ st@@ adion , where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held gap to the big animals .
Clinton and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP - they want both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
the two US presidential competitors are , however , at the tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental question .
the differences between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton lies a fundamental , more philosoph@@ ical difference .
the , on the role of the state .
tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regul@@ ations .
Clinton wants to best@@ ow the economy to death and regulate to death , he says .
he himself would be quite different , claims Tr@@ ump .
he will return regul@@ ators massive , and he is strong for a vast tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and businesses .
Clinton says : the state has to fulfill certain tasks , he has advant@@ aged chances to open and needs money .
therefore , taxes were raised for the rich , says she .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost what is equal .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are rejected by the state @-@ based te@@ ap@@ y wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so , on Tr@@ ump , no internal discussions could be given .
clear@@ er are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to grow coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal plants in the US .
oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas to termin@@ ate the Paris climate agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton wants to extend and strengthen renewable energies with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of the clean energies and create millions jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - also with international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the cap@@ aci@@ dic trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both the US would not want to regulate the international trade , but simply to protect the US jobs .
they should also be paid even better , Clinton tells about Clinton .
the present minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
it wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to be , then he says he will not be changed .
however , the major discussion of the coming months should be likely to develop the tax policy of the two bearings .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to un@@ load the economy and the citizens to boost growth .
his critics hold him ahead , that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton stands at least from the rich who wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more control are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every one @-@ fle@@ dged woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who are wander@@ ing alone , almost everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen , four women sit .
each one has a baby that is maximum one year old .
one has put her little son into his arm .
he looks curious in the room with big eyes .
his mother st@@ amped on the table top .
until it not@@ ices that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles briefly and kissed the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until you talk to Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is the manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social ship@@ ments in Bavaria , and deals with the topic women on the escape .
the four women in the kitchen are wing@@ ed .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized accommodation for all@@ u@@ ged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s War .
it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - even as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has made experience with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars , because they are politically persecuted because they are guilty of torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as hope of hope , &quot; she tells .
in women , there are many reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal away secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in their homeland they have experience with sexual violence , forced mar@@ riages , honor , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is driving them away .
on the run , this goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , tu@@ g@@ boats demand an sexual action for a bottle of water , is not a rarity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe that once they would come to Germany , you are mist@@ aken .
here too , women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and even ab@@ rup@@ tly ab@@ used .
this is that about 90 percent of women living in the Munich &apos;s north , trau@@ mati@@ zed , estimates them .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not volunte@@ ered . &quot;
many women have so used to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or she doesn &apos;t dare to speak openly about the living , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they are often not willing to help , there is more accommodations for them , calling for B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they w@@ asted from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answer some with no .
there is no such thing in the governments of the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken .
in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press brief@@ er of the government .
in some parts of the halls , lower and middle fran@@ ken houses , there are only individual women and their children only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are being accommod@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if the privacy or women are accommod@@ ated together , men and women can come together - constantly rising - violence against women . &quot;
above all , the shower room should be easily accessible and accessible to women , stands in the study .
how much women feel this protection need , one can read on the And@@ re that there is at the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since there has been around that there are us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
Regist@@ rar stri@@ ves : demands for new labour measures
members of the Regist@@ rar have called for their union to appro@@ ve new labour measures in their disp@@ utes regarding a new agreement .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded its entire Council to appro@@ ve more action from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that it should be ministers to take on the wor@@ rying concerning the contract .
in July , Regist@@ rar and medical students have agreed on the re@@ jection of a contract that has been agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who matched the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained quiet &quot; quietly , &quot; which led to the fact that the contract was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At the end of this the J@@ DC Executive awarded the proposed new contract to complete the proposed new Treaty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board today announced a formal motion for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a run program of escal@@ ating workers that starts at the beginning of September .
the disp@@ utes led to Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ sts this year six times , the first total failure in the N@@ HS history .
the head of the BM@@ A Regist@@ rar Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back to the election of the agreed contrac@@ tual agreement , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 Assi@@ sten@@ si@@ sts and medical agents , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jeremy H@@ unt , said that the contract for physicians would be introduced in England .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of external side &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure which ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up his hands and proc@@ laim a official end of the eight month war in the war and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ player in the gold @-@ g@@ ilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I cannot spoil myself from int@@ ru@@ cks that Ankara wants to be reconciliation .
there was the thread , yes .
but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles appeared shy and hardly radi@@ ate warmth , even for its rec@@ asting circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , on the contrary , repe@@ ats his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not count any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even be improving .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved like that , would never happen any worst .
seem@@ ingly , his enthusiasm seemed rather to signi@@ fy the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable kitchen showed that the state of state of Russia had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his execution : the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was w@@ ut@@ ent@@ lessly .
Putin divided and accused Ankara to have Russia back into the back .
the failure was even bigger , since it was committed by a personal friend .
the show@@ cases back up again will be difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state @-@ controlled media conducted a violent , non @-@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once it seemed , the Turks would carry anything to blame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleg@@ ations of leaders in Syria have benef@@ ited that Erdoğan had benef@@ ited from illegal oil dealers in Syria , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only therefore because Putin received the excuse for President Erdoğan &apos;s President Erdo@@ gan .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are clearly on hand .
Erdo@@ gan takes all the friends who can get after last month after a failed coup d &apos;@@ etat .
the terrorist attack on Turkey has also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic moti@@ fs .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facil@@ itated if the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal hi@@ de@@ an in the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the television footprint is projected fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish farm imports are allowed to be allowed .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; tourists stayed there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara fur@@ i@@ ously anger@@ ed Ankara on the West , since its reaction to the attempted power of power was considered a weak response .
to achieve this , the pro@@ found@@ ly gro@@ ll of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke is to move out of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
in Ankara , Russian state leader won a bonus for a bonus that he called for a coup d &quot; é@@ tat of the elected state organs .
this is good for Moscow not@@ ices a self @-@ understand@@ able , that even a deep @-@ sitting fear of regim@@ es has changed .
the summit in this glorious Palace in the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , one how it once described me an analyst , &quot; Alliance of external side &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate from the West and get badly dealt with and now unite .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still large differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but to support Russia and Turkey .
it could be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of preliminary talks , both pre@@ sidents affir@@ med the press conference , that they had not even been stri@@ ped out of the theme .
the president of Turkey r@@ ents out to respond to a question about their differences while Putin decided to empha@@ size these .
there is no clear con@@ sensus about where a common N@@ en@@ ner can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and given the potential for a perfect Dis@@ aster , when NATO member states attacked the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders talk at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland not available for customers outside Scotland
according to the Bank R@@ BS , the Bank has only to be reduced to a back@@ office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand joined the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced nearly scrat@@ ched and rescu@@ ed almost eight years ago .
in this time , brand str@@ at@@ ters have used &quot; R@@ BS &quot; to protect other end consumer finance .
she supported the international sports with millions pounds on sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
but now she decided to take more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B are references , the central headquarters and the IP@@ s .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for private customer business , which will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our investment stamp , as well as the brand being employed by our employees , as we are now going to become a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became the global brand .
I say now that we are not pursuing global goals , but local goals .
each of these brands will be completely different in their own municipalities and our employees will work under these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing will no longer be continued and that it will increase the per@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility of different brands in his sports sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop the bank of the brands , for how do we concentrate on inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think that the time has come .

and he &apos;s still not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to keep on competitions until his at least 5@@ 0.@@ 55 years .
Russian Putin hum@@ ert Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly released his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was many years part of the closest confi@@ de cre@@ st of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for environmental and transport affairs .
in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Putin is that Putin is arranged without indication of &quot; the dis@@ miss@@ al Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as Chairman of the Russian President of the Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who founded Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , has been appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital , Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the renowned state of Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in Tokyo .
on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website ( in Russian ) it means that he was later head of the head of the head of the head of the head office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of state and inspec@@ tions to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysteri@@ ously .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest colleagues Vladimir Putin and works as he was for Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff returns to his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so , is there the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that at present .
but the official claim - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president once was to lead to Russian environmental policy - came to great scep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin , which are cited on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It &apos;s true that I asked you to do this very complicated item in early 2012 - one could almost say - to be confi@@ dential for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and the former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , was appointed K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin made power to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third office of Putin could viol@@ ate the Constitution .
but this post was taken by another , approaching ally Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister , before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson was fired after the producers hit producers
Gibson was involved in a physical argument at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced in a common opinion its termination .
Gibson , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ els@@ , was publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his resignation .

Queens@@ bury Cross@@ ing : bridge now associated with Fi@@ fe
the cost of £ 1.@@ 35 billion is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North @-@ deck of Queens@@ bury Cross@@ ing with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now associated with fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four shifts in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deck@@ oos &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge stage of fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 circuits .
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to come from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ us Cross@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of a crafts@@ manship of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the expi@@ ration between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
overall , almost 79 % of the entire bridge of bridge at their place and the last section of the de@@ cks are given today in Ros@@ y@@ th a bet@@ ong@@ uss for the deck , which means the whole deck is ready to be lifted to its square .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone at each bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of future @-@ looking high @-@ construction and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last street cover and its connection with the expansion of the North @-@ Pacific deck , we needed to close the gap on the north or country side .
this was reached by pulling the bridge over 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and very delicate job at the same time .
massive , because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , about 6.000 tons weight and had to be moved at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
the toler@@ ances , as the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , were tiny - on each side it was only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately , everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have good luck to be alive &quot;
three men have &quot; luck still alive &quot; after being thrown out of her fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station hit Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty able to swim in safety while their boat moved from their own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and made us the worst thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vince Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the wind is blowing with the boat apart from its range until we left to water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at age 60 and was suspended without life jacket without life jacket .
they were all aboard the storage boots and were brought back to the rescue @-@ station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have been hurt un@@ hurt and still life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot engine had a notebook , but dis@@ band@@ ed , however , to the boat of the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone today knew about these men .

on the street she met the ex @-@ partner of man .
when the two women again spread the flat , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had his sister to his side and handle his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds Braunschwei@@ gs cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green mine : investors obliged to be much stronger in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments during the next years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; hand concept living &quot; for the next install@@ ment .
but arguments is programmed .
the first line is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Christoph Brat@@ mann said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Green Party : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Green Party : who wants to build on urban areas must prove 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the favorable apartments can also be created in stock .
the big conflict in the town hall was , however , the Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private faces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors on such a land at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban residential construction programme , which will cost millions , and will still be financed , shall provide incen@@ tives .
the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there are still no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as a few regulations as possible .
the Left wants to increase hardness limits for investors .
regardless of its , so Brat@@ mann , t@@ opped up the situation of the situation on the housing market .
the action concept is implemented , will ensure additional tasks in the construction administration .
more staff will be needed .
it is un@@ clear if we will get the skilled workers .
but the program does not stand completely : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments which should be built anyway .
but how do you compare the loss of further about 1300 cheap apartments , whose promotion will run out in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the designer of Nicole Palm , S &amp; D spokesperson on planning , should now be purchased out of the city .
furthermore , it would have to be thought to pick apartments back into the price connection .
this is possible in the western town .
to blow a blow , solve the problem .
the dead@@ lines run out at the end of the year .
approximately 1800 apartments could be bought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : we don &apos;t want the owners , the housing companies not .
because the number of social apartments in the West city is dras@@ tically increased , they are removed from the target of so @-@ called mixing .
there is no more concentration of social weak in just a few parts .
the Gre@@ ens agree that there will be some movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swoboda : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a vast majority the CD@@ U must be connected to the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is focused on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean , however , that not yet a compromise can be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , that pays off
it is fascinating how the world changes .
that te@@ ens and child don &apos;t go out outside , but rather it would prefer to spend their free time to spend on screens , has been compl@@ ained of many years in the last decade .
at Po@@ k@@ emon Go , people get to pick up people from the sofa and get more active .
the time at the screen was initially limited to TV , then on video games and last@@ ly on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive .
I am looking forward to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that was created first for the video games in the 1990s ( later it created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture fell slightly ahead of the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was shi@@ fted by the massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within a few days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go will have more users as T@@ inder and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players are looking for outside and looking for Po@@ k@@ é@@ mons that are followed with a GPS and once they were found once found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; taken cap@@ tive . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the w@@ ahn and jumped for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in incre@@ ments that the &quot; average &quot; person returns each day .
Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , followed by the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the market launch of the game , the number of people followed by 45 per cent to 53 percent each day .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw details for increasing performance .
many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to bring about &quot; themselves 30 minutes &quot; to come from the sofa , &quot; and &quot; every day to be active , &quot; launched on deaf ears , because many public messages are bo@@ red to health and come from people who look like this .
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be evaluated .
anyone who regularly drives sports , reduces his chances of getting cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages , which is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon go is that there is people to do something in the open , making them fun .
there are three pillars of health cover - movement , fresh air and sunshine , and fun .
some people close hunting even new friend@@ ships .
anyway , there are more serious h@@ is@@ ations , which must always be harder to complain about .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should it be ?
a breakthrough has happened .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit earlier couldn &apos;t follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game .
new will lose its appeal and use it with time .
however , due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ites in the real world , and so many people can help hunting , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
stunning on the ground .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast ended on Thursday for multi@@ use title and extended the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver med@@ alists and &quot; Final Five &quot; Team kam@@ er@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ a@@ ill@@ en@@ ing@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ let tur@@ nt in the Swedish Baltic Sea , during the single campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who wins a multi @-@ stage title and a total of the fifth , while they consoli@@ date their reputation , to be the best of their generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears , when her final result was shown and her long journey took place at this moment .
she puts it in the same league as a unique athl@@ ete like Michael P@@ helps , which brought her sports to new heights :
in the past three years , Bil@@ bao domin@@ ates her sports art - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast that I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was waiting for a final examination in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athl@@ ete , but rather between it and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not having a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , on the left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man rever@@ ts after having won gold and silver in single multi @-@ fight for women at the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ let took the first medal on Tuesday while she retired on the farewell party coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i as an ex@@ clamation mark .
although it insi@@ sted , during their long journey to the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical tum@@ bling passport - is matched to Latin American music , at home from the road outside of the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child , and by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother , during a school trip into the gym hall , was discovered in Bo@@ or@@ man , became the force .
since the summer of 2013 she has no longer lost a campaign competition , a winning party that will continue as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina was light caused by two tor@@ ments , the image collapsed .
Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ es and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bal@@ es holds the world championship title - l@@ ur@@ ned .
she repeated again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig sea again - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground still another one .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ gged them gently as they expected their final - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears gle@@ amed up in shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision that they once described in their collective book , became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke in Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 year old team captain , called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; had a lead .
after their soil , she threw the audience of K@@ us@@ sh@@ es , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as it concerns , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old shows a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in serial kill@@ ings at the music shot by car
according to police reports , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first mass attack by Phoenix , while listening to the car .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in an entry , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ rators brought eight shots from a hand@@ le@@ w@@ ling weapon , while it stood on the rear side of the car and left with another vehicle , to read in the report .
the police reported that the triple murder did not have the outcome of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the att@@ acker does not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who owned one of the adult victims .
the police officer of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investig@@ ators had led the investig@@ ators to get a close look at whether they are connected to four previous attacks .
in total , predominantly in h@@ is@@ panic residential neighbor@@ hoods were killed in nine attacks in nine attacks in nine attacks and two more injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ an from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence they are led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ itali@@ zed due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah still died on the spot .
a witness shared by the police , that it was not unusual for them to sit and listen to music in a par@@ ted car .
the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which was eliminated half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridges and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of its age , Edmund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I don &apos;t make that .
I don &apos;t create that .
I didn &apos;t let me .
what is not true ? of course , one has settled on it , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and her was informed that Edmund she will never recognise it under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to be institutional .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that the people still do , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund may run with help of a remedy .
Edmund could neither sit still cra@@ w@@ l up to his third year of life , and he can still not speak .
but he is making progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language that Edmund for &quot; Please sing something from me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him drawing language with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is no typical character pron@@ unci@@ ation -- it says . Edmund has invented some character alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as at Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or Z@@ ic@@ avirus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it is affecting the life of those with the Z@@ ic@@ avirus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remembers the emotional price of a uncertain future .
I wondered what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and it still doesn &apos;t know .
I was thinking about the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time because I didn &apos;t expect someone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has caused a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ic@@ avirus .
it will be better .
they know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
severe rainfall , floo@@ ding gives cause to b@@ ail@@ ments in Louisiana , Mississippi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large floods in Louisiana forced the governor to sh@@ out the staff on Friday . it will be reck@@ oned by more rainf@@ alls on Friday .
numerous rivers in the southeast Lou@@ isi@@ anas and the south of the Por@@ pp@@ is flooded the banks and threatened with large floods in extreme rainf@@ alls , the National weather service reported .
the Governor of Louisiana John B@@ el Edwards has shared that the official contact with local authorities have already been on the way to the concerned con@@ greg@@ ations .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Governor , shared with the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ i to Saturday .
the weather service provided that additional 3 to 5 inches could fall to rain in this area .
in the South of Alabama , a flood warning system was used on Friday while it continues to rain in the mobile area .
the Com@@ ite River near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louisiana , will all likely reach more than the weekend of record level .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Krau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could over@@ flow many houses in the presence of Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a down@@ stream flood in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish represents a danger , since these rivers run through the driven rivers run slowly in Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the Tick@@ fa@@ v river , south of the Mississippi State Border , in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest stand at 09.@@ 00 on Friday .
rescue teams are still involved people from the flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ mother , were among those who were rescu@@ ed near Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually far more than 400 feet from his house , rising sharply by night .
he said that another step@@ mother , who lives near , would have been warned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford that she lived in the 48 years in which she lived there , never had seen such a rise of the river .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would have the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that funds were rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they were accommod@@ ated to Friday .
Krau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood &quot; had spread quickly &quot; as it continued to continue heavy rain ra@@ ins , and that authorities are hes@@ itation of ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions .
according to Krau@@ t@@ mann , a ob@@ servers in the vicinity of Living@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13,@@ 75 inches of rain .
Krau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was substantial in the rain since Wednesday .
the authorities admitted that heavy rain ra@@ ins and road flooded the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and the way of teaching in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that there were 200 flooded houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , which were both flooded .
the pre@@ sidents of the church of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities were saved 72 people and seven pets allowed by the floods .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , not@@ icing have been appointed to lodge the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will return to their houses , &quot; he said .
in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen streets are closed due to the flood and sand@@ bags for the residents , who hope to keep the water from their homes and shops .
&quot; the last great flood which we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum by the city administration .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in the tip , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Harrison Count@@ ys told that it continues to continue on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a hand@@ ful of houses on Thursday have been reported to be flooded , but there were no reported on Friday .
Keith Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; Out of balls , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police as@@ signs that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6 year old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents gave the fact that Brown had suffered several fire@@ arms , including in the l@@ ashing , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was at his transport to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done much , his little body was pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ch@@ z the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe this .
the condition of the boy was classified in a hospital as a critical and he had to under@@ go several surg@@ eries .
the family of the boy shared the station with that he is likely to be repeated again .
he would have to start the first class in a local elementary school .
Brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable condition .
the boy was placed on the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical state , shot up , reports the station .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police determined precisely if one of the injured men could be the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
investig@@ ators distributed C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a cross@@ bow between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ ced to various assault ri@@ fle , disp@@ at@@ ched the crime scene .
it seems that there was clearly a constant struggle .
on the street , on both sides of the walk , seals were located .
so there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; said Police skin p@@ mann Anthony G@@ inal@@ di the police in Philadelphia the transmitter .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no convention and the police currently examine reports , the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl met by a cross ra@@ cket when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
they re@@ covering and the police seek after a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I present in the Tur@@ ning &apos;s Olympic champion and for more than one reason .
firstly I &apos;ve been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three hand@@ ner@@ ders , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspi@@ rational for many young girls other comple@@ xion .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the J@@ üd@@ in is and Madison Ko@@ en@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ lics , round off , makes every proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has strengthened the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the past four years the number one was one Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that is what strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was celebrated a surprising Olympics in America and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they expected unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ masks rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual Americans who won gold in an individual multi @-@ stage event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the top of these sports , but so do not look like gy@@ ms in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic champion will have only four women in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mar@@ ta Kar@@ oly@@ i as train@@ ers .
but the reality looks like that Tur@@ ns is a expensive sport and Turner &apos;s first line in private gy@@ ms that are maintained by parents , who come up for training , setup , travel and hotel costs ( for the coach and their Turner and families ) .
the majority of these gy@@ ms are in weal@@ thy suburbs that can support business .
in these associations , the Turner will receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long lasting commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes , since they started working with the turbo .
we have to be inspired by the municipalities of Au@@ n inn@@ um@@ erable young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie .
I founded my gy@@ ms of 20 years .
in my events we have free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15.000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic ) and trains national and international winners .
in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth of high quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and professional and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ sion@@ ism and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is so exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you who motivated her so many young girls with different background to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance @-@ doctors do want to organize further strikes after they refused Jeremy Hun@@ ts suggestion
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes due to the assumption of a re@@ formed agreement with the function@@ aries of British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 37@@ ,000 assistance doctors who voted in a choice , refused him .
in July H@@ unt plans revealed that the treaty was forced to introduce the treaty and said that N@@ HS was found in a &quot; ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay for the staff and patients would be harmful .
the first assistance @-@ directors are to receive a new contract , which also contains modifications to night and weekend work to improve the care of up@@ lifting times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assi@@ sten@@ si@@ sts distributed last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance @-@ doctors have addressed to the proposed Treaty , in particular that it will heat up the current staff crisis and to do it to treat all doctors . &quot;
in just eight weeks that still remains , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts on the BM@@ A solution to resol@@ ving disp@@ utes through talks strug@@ gled with the government to take part in the government and sometimes on o@@ hren@@ stun@@ ned silence .
it was the case of a promise that Jeremy H@@ unt had made it until the last month , that his door would always be off@@ ended .
&quot; Jeremy H@@ unt must now act to raise the lifting vibration and address the concerns of Assi@@ sten@@ tions . &quot;
if he does not do this , so , the assistance doctors have made clear that they are willing to carry further work action .
the last strike at the end of April saw an increase of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and doctors were included to provide doctors on the strike chain .
the ministers were hoping to end the dispute concerning the amend@@ ment of the re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to pay a better week@@ day pay for the 5@@ 4,000 assistance doctors that are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of N@@ HS employees , demanded the assistance of assistance to end the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; labour measures achieve nothing of the only little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nursing and their families only wor@@ ries , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
in the past two months , we talked to the Committee of Assi@@ sten@@ si@@ sts and responded with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stri@@ es on concern regarding the gu@@ ardi@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
employers have hoped that the continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as horror , training courses , training courses , training courses , mutual recognition of the cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , training courses and the gender pay gap in medicine - such as serious employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning the adher@@ ence of agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 per day - medication that can reduce heart attacks
thousands of heart disease patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day medication , after being recommended by the authorities to submit more people for a longer period .
the intestinal drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for individuals with a heart disease .
the medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ HS regul@@ ators ( N@@ HS ) has been recommended for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regul@@ ators ( N@@ HS ) has been recommended for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
approximately 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ized material in the arter@@ ial walls , which form layers .
when the Bel@@ ag breaks out , it can cause blood cl@@ ots to c@@ logged blood flow to heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
if blood cl@@ ots dis@@ sol@@ ves , it can flow through the flow of blood flow and the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons , who already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk of having a further risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca , is produced and sold under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduced this risk by more likely the formation of blood cl@@ ots .
the draft bill of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with twice daily intake of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack or stroke - often with des@@ ast@@ ro@@ uting consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of one person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
by a provisional recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people that can benefit from this .
the information on the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the bill is not recommended to treat over this period .
Culture of Political correc@@ t@@ ness makes election fraud in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report due to corruption .
a culture of political correc@@ t@@ ness has led to recognise that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities will be ignored as a devastating government report today .
the ex @-@ cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kles respon@@ ds to the police , election ob@@ servers and town houses to have evidence of mis@@ use due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Local Government , who is now a ant@@ sen@@ sel@@ ess , said that the ti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motivation would be so bad that the police should be allowed to establish barriers outside of voting cabins , to protect mid@@ wives voters .
he recommends that voters should lead to their identity in order to prove their identity .
currently , voters have to call his name and address .
the report suggests , un@@ removable ink on the finger of a person if they give up their sel@@ ections , to prevent somebody cho@@ oses twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official com@@ presses or working groups .
&quot; this does not only serve against electoral fraud , but also the municipal government should protect against the bro@@ ader corruption and financial fraud strategy , &quot; he said .
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Ele@@ ction of London in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the re@@ ig@@ ning Council of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be revealed on cor@@ rup@@ ts and illegal practices of his Am@@ tes .
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; on cy@@ n@@ ical manner , &quot; and that he had brought his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it was the reli@@ ed duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or a follow @-@ up , where one person cho@@ oses any other .
Sir Eric said it would give evidence for fraud throughout the country .
he , in particular , expressed himself al@@ arm@@ ingly to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure to people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to su@@ stain the electoral system , including the desire of evidence to prove the identity
in his report , it says : &quot; as proof was appropriate that pressure on protection @-@ needy members was exercised by some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in particular communities with Pakistan or ban@@ ist@@ er@@ ical background to vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be ignored in regard to eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion according to eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the ban that political activists send letter documents to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May in encour@@ agement , demands also tough@@ er registration tests to prevent the election directory for immigration and social fraud .
consider options to ask voters off the choice after your identity card .
do not use remote ink on the finger of a person when she has given her voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic reviews about the nationality of a person to make sure they are voting .
a three @-@ year limited liability to an automatic selection of letters .
prohibition that political activists have a complete election @-@ elections and env@@ elop@@ es of letters .
the police give the powers to establish bul@@ locks for poll@@ ing stations .
a legislative change which facil@@ it@@ ates an indictment due to in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation in the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 .
photographer for@@ b@@ ade in voting stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
intensive training of training , to ensure that employees are generally consistent that voters will go alone in the sel@@ ections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surprisingly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets the case was not issued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the electoral court has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy , due to a lit@@ ur@@ ry on corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said .
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty , according to the high demands on the criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ controls &quot; of the elec@@ torate of elec@@ torate of the Rath@@ houses .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court part in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
our country , as the mother of par@@ li@@ aments , bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and covered spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger . another famous Doppel@@ gänger from Olympic Port in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio are celebrating this week via the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , except the edge and the band that proved an impressive dou@@ bling of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 year old Olymp@@ ion@@ ic@@ in is by far not the only one who has gold strug@@ gling Ath@@ let who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if you have to give the social media faith .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ ppers at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL created a lists to Olymp@@ ion@@ ic mark@@ eters , which feature more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team in Ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , on the left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o for his childhood .
apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gänger on the bike track , many people acted on the Internet as a certain ar@@ cher of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the US team in Ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused an on@@ s@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after images that he looks like to see the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cover@@ tly .
in fact , the ar@@ cher was given the mad@@ ness in the social media with and admitted that he has already heard of his childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I don &apos;t see a great simil@@ arity , except the hair hair@@ y , &quot; shared Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I can do that as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will no doubt enter the focus of this year : the resulting simil@@ arity between British performer Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her large , expres@@ sive eyes should go through to the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared to the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one speed higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the inc@@ eption actor
another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , which shows similarly heavy eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medals in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun@@ b@@ ted skin and bl@@ on@@ ous hair as the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan was att@@ ain@@ ted by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt &quot; .
strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about that others are the simil@@ arities too .
theory in the room : according to this user , there is a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple may be a reason
a Twitter User@@ in declared their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact the US football star Hope Solo and Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , the almost identical with the actress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold med@@ alists in the Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own beautiful , wide smile , which resem@@ bles by Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union .

the Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to excuse themselves , after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese law was lost in &quot; like Mi@@ ef &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator Byron Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone was turned off when it &apos;s going to complete his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been collected on the comment@@ ator team of the C@@ BS to give more &quot; colour , &quot; you could hear : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the attachment , baby . &quot;
too excited , as Mi@@ ef , died like a pig .
thanks for that .
the Chinese flo@@ ats in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of swimming pools 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to stop the gap in China .
audience in Canada re@@ acted fast online once they were shocked by the clay and the language .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Has the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old flo@@ ats in China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;

the criticism of Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter arrived quickly and hard at which many were talking about him
Twitter users did not return when they heard how un@@ sensitive Byron Mac@@ don@@ ald was
another Twitter User@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you are just one of the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like ra@@ assi@@ sts . # ange@@ elt .
a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC show , live for the comments of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment on a swimming performance was broadcast . &quot;
it was an un@@ fortunate chosen phrase , I &apos;m sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC dis@@ ap@@ ologi@@ zed for 90 occasions at the end of the 90 people who answered the emer@@ itus on Twitter
the comment@@ ator Scott Rus@@ sel had to excuse themselves in the name of Mac@@ Donald &apos;s
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies for more than 90 other t@@ witter users who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ don@@ ald
the network also exc@@ ised quickly and gave a message out .
we regret it properly , that these statements were made , and that it was possible to broadcast them .
we ap@@ ologi@@ zed yesterday night with our spectators on show and our followers in social media .
in order to clear one , Byron &apos;s comments related to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and a un@@ fortunate chosen formulation . Byron does what he has said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald arrived in the show and tried his remark to justify having said that it was not his intention that she is designed as a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment to take me for the comment I made after the women &apos;s flo@@ ats in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not take care of the performance of the swi@@ mmer in and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there was no contemp@@ t , and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark is ou@@ tra@@ ded over woman who tried sham@@ eless under@@ wear in the middle of business
the buyer did not know where to see , as a woman moved their clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try to try .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she mu@@ stered , as she looked at it , and put them back into the shelf again .
they continued praying and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a business in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , to .
the Pri@@ mark Store in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried the under@@ pants before they put them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who had found herself at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she ref@@ unded and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the sales area , they took a pair of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , with@@ drew its own Str@@ um@@ pf@@ tro@@ users and tro@@ users and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even tried to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , nau@@ gh@@ ty like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she went out the under@@ pants that you didn &apos;t like it , because she got her back into the shelf again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other subjects , before she finally decided that she did not feel right , shi@@ fted and out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not seem to distur@@ b them that someone observed , or about the person who would buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how contra@@ di@@ ct that someone would take under@@ pants with home that had a different person , and that have not been washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I have received , the employees tried to pull out the clothes from the sale , after she went - what &apos;s just the same thing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants to go home and find out that another woman had an@@ gled and went out and didn &apos;t have washed them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before arms attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail.com could make him safer for you .
we spoke to Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to move with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from front or rear , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewers for your rob@@ ber .
if you are approaching from behind , then you should be able to see your att@@ ack@@ ers so that you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit the face with your free el@@ bows .
hit him with the knee in the cr@@ ust and rotate , while the att@@ acker dis@@ com@@ fy pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run and move backward , while they turn the weapon on him .
when att@@ ack@@ ers , that is approaching , the technique is similar - move your body from the gun line , take the weapon and rotate it , so the att@@ acker can &apos;t shoot .
at the same time , put the weight on the weapon and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backward and set the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi superior .
but remember that there is a smo@@ ky on the saf@@ est way to exagger@@ ate your money - as long as you are not a Kra@@ a Grand@@ master .
trav@@ eler Ian Wright fails to guide his tongue to the dirty places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ lined his immune system and worms in a serious test - by pushing some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most precious places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel writer Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ olk cut off his position on a Euro @-@ hill , a rail@@ ing on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a rinse pot of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to provide the resistance of its immune system .
in front of each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show oneself , and to show us what he is going to get .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight .
the thought , the dish@@ wah@@ er of a train toilet emp@@ t@@ ted , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive but in fact , there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sp@@ inning .
on his journey through Europe , Mr Wright said with doctors and medical specialists on promoting intestinal bacteria and its own health .
fortunately , nothing left behind him , nothing more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr Wright was well known to test the resistance of its intest@@ ines by passing through the world , as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations up to dish@@ washers of toilets , the task assigned to its immune system under a sample
in the film he told : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health concern and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and s@@ lu@@ dge . &quot;
in the film he was definitely righteous in his call .
the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its dent@@ ure showed a lumin@@ ance of more than 4000 units .
compared with this , the L@@ umin@@ ometric level is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to le@@ ak after their lumin@@ ance count exceeds 4000 units , while freshly washed hands are less than 60 .
Mr Wright and the Finnish producers of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel route &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom
in the film he says , &quot; That &apos;s the worst thing I &apos;ve got in a toilet , close . &quot;
there is nothing less dirt than that !
I &apos;m going to le@@ ak nothing here , because it is natural here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o bra@@ ids , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that is fascinating for watching and at the same time explains the benefits of Pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we brought crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings , which ended so we told &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon , and with the documentary we were able to provide more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direction of the film , added : &quot; let me say that I have lost my respect for Ian if he had to have some of the things I needed to le@@ ak , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet which is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian , to le@@ ak them and others , with which this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad that we have recorded some of these dirty treats in film . &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of those surveyed had lac@@ tic acid bacteria particularly with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they have at least occasionally used products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .

Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for home administration at Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing , said that she fears the apartment no longer to repair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to take into account , since this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part Corn@@ wall walls .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , who lived in the flat in the flat , and the police said that the terror that had joined the family , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ bles , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking and excessive scre@@ ams , stre@@ ches and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the le@@ ase , received an anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house that will be demol@@ ished under circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
these were done in the property where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wood@@ co@@ als are torn
neighbours said they had to fight them on the streets and had to be called by the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing del@@ etes them and their partners this week violent from the property , after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer voluntarily .
the del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors , saying that their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were not ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived for 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we are saying to the police are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not familiar !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing said that it would have s@@ acked the family with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called by regular intervals , 20 years .
tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown onto the covered side of the municipal house .
he added : &quot; it is a shame that it ab@@ h@@ ates the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family , as del@@ og@@ ation is always the final step in terms of Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing .
that was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extremely difficult and their deeds had to look terrible for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the church , who have passed cour@@ ageous on us and have provided us the information we have done .
I hope that this development will don@@ ate encour@@ agement to some neighbours , and the message convey@@ s that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be toler@@ ated .
Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons have lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , left in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ og@@ ation on the ground .
workers of the house administration will now have to vac@@ ate garbage bags , surrounded by the house
in 2014 , police arrested a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis and orph@@ ans , par@@ ap@@ her@@ es and cash in a height of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don was a fine penalty after having found guilty of a drug of class B in commercial view .
she claimed that the money was a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came to life at a car accident in 2013 .
after being without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ffiti by gra@@ ffiti .
the police says that she will del@@ ate rent@@ ers , who do not keep to the assignment of the house .
Angela C@@ row from the Devon and Corn@@ wall police shared that the del@@ og@@ ation is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not hold on the assignment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without deduc@@ tible as well as those who were har@@ med by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Devon and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

also at 3 : 2 in the trial period against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. were not really persu@@ asive .

Ma and Z@@ hang was left alone on the record alone , between the sets and in time @-@ outs they did not have co@@ aches .
they had been withdrawn from the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their arch@@ ers in fair competition alone .

Ma had really really to fight with his 28 @-@ year opponent .
afterwards he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang , since only a total of 13 points .
through the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma , not the expected swe@@ eping Match .

Donald Tr@@ ump dre@@ aming &quot; mighty problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Rep@@ ublic@@ ans will be pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditionally the conservative state nations ra@@ ged their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave the weak@@ nesses of his campaign in the past Republican Hoch@@ burg Utah .
a rare moment in which the Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire is usually expressed as concerns expressed as concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals inside his Republican camp &apos;s Republican camp , the doubts still grow in the battle for the White House .
&quot; we have powerful problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for assistance in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
guilt are false reports about his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media sch@@ ema .
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds
Utah is normally a safe bank for rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ s from June , Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor were defeated by the Democrats , Hillary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump though , but not by distance that are common for republi@@ can candidates in the state of State .
however , Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered too .
in an interview of the Senate CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question of how he would stop the rise to Clin@@ t : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
and if back : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he will do nothing different to tell the truth . &quot;
if the end for reasons of political correc@@ t@@ ness is not rich , it is fine , said Tr@@ ump further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to the press reports , the Party of Tr@@ ump is supposed to submit funds to support his election campaign , it should not be able to present a better survey values .
instead of putting the candidates for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans to be stronger under arms .
Olympia : tri@@ ster fraud on D@@ oping test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a discipl@@ in@@ arian commission .
con@@ fer@@ tile athletes threat@@ ens after the second D@@ oping affair at Rio de Janeiro &apos;s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after a fraud attempt at a d@@ oping control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a coach home to Kenya .
the International Olympic Committee decided to establish a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ Commission promp@@ tly , to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had indicated that the former Sprinter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village had a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ speed of F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i .
this is the team leader Ken@@ ias have been reported by the d@@ oping control devices .
the IA@@ AF world association has searched the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to str@@ ingent out an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will receive an evaluation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was stated in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the d@@ oping control station and signed himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ er , the sample delivered and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken@@ ias boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was owned by the athletes who stood at the list for training inspec@@ tions in the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ er was made more than 800 metres in Beijing 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics leader Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
he should be informed about cash payments of his country via upcoming D@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he reportedly been arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya has already been under special observation at the IO@@ C after numerous D@@ oping treaties at the IO@@ C .
at the announcement of the more than 2000 d@@ oping test controls in front of the Rio Olympics , it has also been noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into the visor .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had a lot of pressure on African country to create a anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympia @-@ start .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya submitted from the list of countries whose D@@ oping com@@ b@@ ating with the WA@@ DA rules are .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the world &apos;s athletes won in the 2015 World Cup in Beijing most medals .
in a series of TV reports , ARD has repeatedly raised again that they are easily accessible in Kenya D@@ oping means and there is a considerable ment@@ ality of the sport fraud .
in the end , IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und requested a similar study in Kenya as he had asked them in the Russian athle@@ tics .
it could be proved that in this sport type and was systematically remembered .
Russia &apos;s athletes then were excluded from the summer games .
Salz@@ burger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ Jahr the Salz@@ burger Fest@@ spiele present the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli with a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conquered Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins master@@ piece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth room .
in the orchestra pit , Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra conducted by the Venezu@@ elan conductor Gust@@ avo Dud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ med .
we always say they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and mel@@ ody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays a older novel .
she remembers his loving kindness with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first , because they are really exceptional !
and then Mari@@ as personality would be .
she says it in her song : &quot; I for Pret@@ ty , oh so Pret@@ ty , I for Pret@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
she is so clever , of course also nai@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character , whom I have called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such a honour for us to work with you .
she is a cri@@ tically generous person .
and Bart@@ oli is the compli@@ ment back : &quot; Dud@@ amel is an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in any of his movements , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . McKin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side story &quot; at present : &quot; in this piece it is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ atism . &quot;
today , we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York population did not want them .
they are the same issues , and they are just as convincing as at that time .
59 years later , this piece is still relevant .
London School of school , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school cities , left London last year to join the IS , reportedly told reportedly in Syria .

Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died after his family shortly after she had planned to leave the war and return to England .
&quot; you can only hope that the only good is in it - as a m@@ esh and warning to others that these are the risks involved in a war zone - people who have ever heard this decision , &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school cities rose from the east of London into a plane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
sult@@ anas &apos;s family has been informed that they married ISIS @-@ fighters in Syria - and has been a widow within a few months .

the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to choose Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Tre@@ ats want nu@@ is@@ ance for &quot; Women and Men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine works with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere in order to recover a 1970s Pi@@ relli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of Top@@ models for 2017 .
the chief editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year , that his neck @-@ magazine from Old@@ school @-@ play@@ boys were distingu@@ is@@ hable from &quot; Playboy for men . &quot;
I do that for women .
apparently he is the view that it does the calendar too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must return to portra@@ yal of timeless and classical neck , where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release to release the Cal@@ endars . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Turkey : Kurdish congregation reck@@ ons with mass curse
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t fit and Erdo@@ gan sits on the packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the spirit of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kurdish municipality of Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of safegu@@ ards coming from Turkey to Germany in short @-@ term .
in the medium term , there could even be &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; the presi@@ ding Chair Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
because of the hard work of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , the Kurdish congregation in Germany expects a mass curse to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ oned with tens of thousands , medium @-@ term with some hundred thousand prot@@ ections from Turkey in Germany when the Erdo@@ gan regime fought the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the President of the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday .
because the government had already passed Kurdish bom@@ bers with criminal actions , 500,000 Kurds in Turkey on the run .
after the failed put@@ sch , the sec@@ ular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added .
many will begin to restart in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes up refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the ban on targeted attacks against Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
so Erdo@@ gan wants to raise the ride back to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were wi@@ ped out or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U member .
the federal government demanded that the government was &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
there is also a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan &apos;s critics in Germany .
I feel no longer in Germany for the first time in the past months .
the German branch of Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks .
more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition leaders .
the fire market as Gü@@ len followers destroyed teachers and other acade@@ mic@@ row@@ ers to professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever doesn &apos;t fit and Erdo@@ gan sits on the packed suit@@ cases , by the way the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Stiftung Dialogue and Education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reports on appeal at the German Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks had already established the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers in Germany for political persecution .
as of June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 people and there@@ with almost 29 per cent of all rights are entitled to be recognized ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there will not be paid to war , poverty or perspectives .
asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are politically , i.e. from the government of government , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ky Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals have nothing from the summer campaign to choose - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
until 2021 , the country code will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the s@@ etter parliament decided at the beginning of the year .
as far as so far it does not go : summer holidays , heat and land battle - that bit@@ es .
the locals that are to be convinced by the fighters are on holiday .
most holi@@ day@@ makers who are on the country are on Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen , or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not the locals who are not allowed to choose the country &apos;s day .
there are practical problems : in the holidays , hel@@ pers , posters infl@@ ames , fl@@ yers , fl@@ yers , and the end of the votes will be accumulated , only m@@ üh@@ ev@@ oll .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last Feri@@ a day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass its electoral struggle for just under the people .
the hot stage , when you can tell it all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clear behind the CD@@ U .
exciting , how strongly new@@ com@@ ing AF@@ D cut off and what remains left at the end of the coalition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years of age , and since 2008 head of head , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his large posters .
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes roses and chat@@ ted a little with the people , just as it did the legendary saying Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , sailors have cold feet and Chancellor Merkel gives the blame for the blo@@ om of the AF@@ D .
her refugee policy , her &quot; We create &quot; I acceler@@ ates the rise of the right pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office .
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you are doing the right place for the wrong time .
she has also invited Angela Merkel to major reports ; the German Chancellor Angela Merkel lies in the Nor@@ theast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mec@@ kl@@ en@@ burger and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad to eman@@ ate from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U ren@@ ounces the usual elec@@ trop@@ hi@@ es on market locations and shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and ballo@@ ons .
that , so co@@ king , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ated role . &quot;
the Union also noticed that on the country it takes away the base that she needs to be very strict , again to find a wire to the people .
you are talking about the Left , the SPD , the Green Party : in the country &apos;s whales are hardly available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U ball@@ ers co@@ ats to his co@@ h@@ ites , though , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must go there where it hur@@ ts , namely , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , golden weddings , any birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because there is a lot in the game , Sell@@ ering has called for a particularly dedicated election campaign .
in p@@ olls , S &amp; D Group recorded a 22 percent partner behind the CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under AF@@ D ( 19 ) .
in 2011 , the SPD won still clearly win with 3@@ 5.6 percent prior to the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the green , small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , is likely to make the leap in the country &apos;s day .
they make a modern virtu@@ e from holiday @-@ need and lay down their election campaign into the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called Claudia Mu@@ eller &apos;s President . &quot; &quot; &quot;

B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : guest sites suffer from blocking
at the rapi@@ dity , with which the B 27 is renovated , there is nothing to complain about .
for those of the construction work , start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and starts only at 20 o &apos;clock , there are all praise praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they made all quite angry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff tells of the jet petrol station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is a super@@ team .
there is no delay .
the construction site could be re@@ located next to the half @-@ time scheduled to the south , until the end of October is expected to be completed .
the Ent@@ ente is also praised for the construction work , such as the establishment of heating trips .
since the construction site is w@@ aved to the South on Monday and also the lock of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thereby the connection to Rot@@ tenburg , the traffic situation has relaxed within the place .
citizens can now go on both sides by O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the traffic through the place seems to be back .
&quot; there was some significant complaints , &quot; says S &amp; D vice @-@ president responsible for the development director Florian King .
the residents of Bach@@ ar Road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many ways were looking for lighter and rather to their Nav@@ i as the signs .
what led to that man@@ oeu@@ v@@ res trucks in residential areas are fran@@ ken .
as the speed limit has not been kept , the community strengthens the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself a spot on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there have been lit@@ tered two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est was travelling with 77 km / hour in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has passed , but it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 , it is only a little consol@@ ation that customers from Rot@@ tenburg are now open the road again .
business professionals have not to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led them to sales in them , everyone who asks you to look through .
however , some people are less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less to do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been produced for other companies , for which the renovation has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even during the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; maximum slight decrease , &quot; but also dreamed of course &quot; the run@@ ny l@@ acks . &quot;
the local spots are the most sha@@ ken up along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds significant words .
that is already exist@@ ential .
not only him , but all the hosts did it . &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the revenue shr@@ ubs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; climbed to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street generation have moved their operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to be dismissed by his fellow workers .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , politics would re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt acted on request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that Gast@@ ein benef@@ ited from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now , they also have to take the dis@@ advantages that results through the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other country circles , where so something generous was handled .
with all Kl@@ agen@@ ers , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his eating house will continue .
after all , family enterprise has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history of history .
that other regular guests are now subject to more complex transport through less frequently , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive , it is also somewhere else beautiful .
after the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt , after the end of the renovation work .
despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on its re@@ ps for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in their long @-@ term history .
six months of work , that is already brutal .
the terrorist control of laws is constantly being screw@@ ed in the name of the terrorist control .
after the recent proposals , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère takes place a thick safety package .
but what has a dul@@ ling status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all of this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconciliation .
all his proposals are politically acceptable , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs in the presentation of his new security committee .
they don &apos;t demand anybody .
other , further points would be discussed initially within the parties .
I took part in this too .
but as the Minister of the Interior , he was located on results and at a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; within the Coalition .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère takes a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , before he presents his conclusions to the Security in the Republic .
but these are all more extensive , however .
some is already known , announced , announced that a new security authority to take care of the cra@@ ck of encrypted communication is not new .
not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU regulations on air passenger data and weapons .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies are also not surprising .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second start for proposals that have not yet to do with the SPD : he wants to kno@@ ck sympath@@ ies for terror groups under punishment and jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will be difficult for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dre@@ aming the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he still stop this for reasonable and demanding nothing , which had no chance in the coalition partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few new ideas presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère too .
this is partially in itself : he is planning to launch a quick procedure for deportation and more possibilities for the detention of people prior to deportation .
refugees who are targeted targeted in the country should check their smartphones and open social media accounts for security check .
for di@@ stra@@ tive asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse offen@@ ders than so far - such as those who go off@@ ences or will@@ ingly dis@@ car@@ ded their papers in order to send their identity .
a lot of it is political and legally .
some also still seems un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and with some points - in the im@@ balance of Ged@@ ser , for instance , the question arises : what does it actually have to do with safety and terror ?
yes , say de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics refugees and terror .
but it cannot be mentioned in tongues , that the assass@@ in of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , many people worried about the high refugee pay for security .
and things that are deeply engaged in people do not let go out in election times .
the internal security is enor@@ mously high in the focus .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nizza .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the security is great .
and yes , there are electoral fights .
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly bringing home security on the subject of internal security .
in the last days it went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ nished dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy officer of some Unions of the Unions , in which the Ress@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs also claim a Bur@@ ka ban and a return of double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also fu@@ gi@@ tive to con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
from a turn from the double @-@ pass he won &apos;t stop anything .
we have fixed the discussion in Germany .
you re@@ inst@@ ate , be not wise .
and on a Bur@@ ka @-@ prohibition he had un@@ constitutional concerns .
whether his own package is constitu@@ ent at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; acceptable &quot; to the coalition partner , only must show itself .
there is some in it , what could happen to battle .
but the SPD , too , is currently attemp@@ ting to benef@@ ited at the subject of internal security .
Part@@ si@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel is only a cau@@ tious talk of conversation and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which contributes to further improve safety . &quot;
Volkswagen is still passing by .
despite Diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery numbers are increasing worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs round .
in the return response , there are vort@@ ex about a term .
Volkswagen launches the deliveries in the second half of the year .
in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ lasting markets , Europe &apos;s largest motor car can continue to show a plus , thanks to the diesel engine .
but in July , the core brand VW we@@ aker largely in Western Europe and therefore loads the total sales as the company announced in D@@ ax .
worldwide , the brand sold Volkswagen in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries declined by almost a sixth .
Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann &apos;s premi@@ er regime led the we@@ aker figures from July , primarily on two sales days less in Europe .
moreover , in some core markets , I have given a purchase sale in some core markets . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote was bur@@ dened by the EU as a spokesperson .
in the USA , where the emission is first escal@@ ated , also a Min@@ us is standing on be@@ ech .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the predominantly affected house mark of Lower Saxony will continue to be worse due to the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extradition minus 0.9 percent is reached to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
consolidated head of the Fred Kap@@ pler from January to July continued to advance a sales growth .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen during this period , 5.@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust .
in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops .
in the course of re@@ armament , Volkswagen re@@ iter@@ ated that the transformation of cars has no negative effects .
after re@@ armament of vehicles , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or engine capacity do not give any deteri@@ oration .
the car makers of the customer after re@@ armament a &quot; guarantee certificate &quot; certificate , but not of a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel .
reason are legal habits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports that Volkswagen has now granted its German customers a guarantee for improved diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this last Monday VW @-@ representatives were confirmed in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the Transport of Transport was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has completed the editions of my In@@ quiry Commission and the KBA fully extensively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or engine performance , after re@@ armament , have no deterior@@ ations and all of the approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen even uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in business travel .
in the wide term &quot; guarantee , &quot; Volkswagen will see the opportunity for example a half year after re@@ armament around with an engine damage to a workshop - and that might result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
it is important to avoid that at any time , it is important to avoid any damage that has nothing to do with the ab@@ sc@@ andal that comes to an in@@ security concerning possible warranty conditions as it was called .
therefore VW doesn &apos;t use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands criminal interest in the future - as the second institute in Germany .
Bank President Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; it &apos;s only around 139 customers who park 40 million euros on the gi@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary policy . &quot;
the Federal Association of German Banks speaks of a single case and doesn &apos;t see a signal : normal savings would not be afraid to pay for their spar@@ se criminal complaint . &quot;
store banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , you must pay a 0.4 percent penalty .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September by private and corporate customers for deposits above 100,000 euros on sight or daily monetary policy .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 Euro in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been a good time of 40 million euros , that could be lifted from one day to the other , and that he could not be able to use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are within me on the central bank account and cause a 0.4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank of the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million 4000 Euros . &quot;
the cost he continues after the urs@@ or principle .
the cash was easy to leave in the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank so much too dangerous : &quot; I have already seen four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! , &quot; said the ban@@ ker .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
few emigrated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable cost in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you alone have to wear , &quot; business economic permanently cannot be possible . &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their fees for bank account , credit cards or transfers .
with criminal interest for deposits from three million euros , the Thur@@ ing@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ berg was made headlines in 2014 with their skat@@ ebo@@ arding branch in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive leader of the banking association said : &quot; we don &apos;t expect that private customers have to pay a nationwide covering for deposits , the competition in Germany is among banks and savings banks much too strong . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a clientele , which is a little exu@@ ber@@ ant of the property . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; if it &apos;s free money .
founded in 1911 , the G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gers , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are currently no further banks known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperative association &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who calcul@@ ating a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the Federal Association of German People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ Banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared the end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold of the negatives compared to the private account is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the competition is hard , and it dro@@ ves the migration of investors to the competition .
customers in Germany will not have fallen in the width .
destination plates : who is buying records actually ?
lon@@ ely men middle ages love plates .
before joining the comment@@ ator , to over@@ se@@ duce it under the p@@ seud@@ onym non @-@ Alle@@ bald @-@ old men with rough ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the visionary production of records is not based on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who like to greet the news of physical objects , but due to mid @-@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently purchased a record are all fore@@ sight after the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most prob@@ able buyer group .
there is also no hor@@ des through Hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older flat buyers keep their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs 53 % ) and enjoy it alone to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but does the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote ?
if this blog would be a news report on television , I would run the camera during a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit , and dig@@ ging wild@@ ly before I stand , my hands hold and something more determin@@ edly as : &quot; so let us take a close look upon it . &quot;
so , let us take a look at it .
even if the heart beats So@@ H@@ os slowly from its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent seller has been based - there are still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I left by Sister Ray ( figures : two young women , three men middle ages ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( figures : eight men middle ages , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill up the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4.000 plates .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed home ) , changing the walls of his sitting room .
the reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available entry : it is now able to buy records , which he could not afford to buy records , which he was sold , when he was young and ple@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agre@@ es to those who buy records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and happily spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much .
this is my aster .
We@@ z , 25 , who works with Sister Ray , also believes that many customers he meets to apply for the You@@ go@@ v profile .
he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ y , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and get to buy their old records back again .
from the discussions that I have led , people usually have dra@@ fted their collection so around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy back their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of the record player of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of panels ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like phon@@ ica to recognise that record shops offers a soo@@ thing community of par@@ ables .
according to We@@ z , some of the older client ass@@ ump@@ tions contact the cont@@ act@@ less payments system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to draw back to the stability of trusted records , of objects , happy j@@ ig@@ ots .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or ownership of material poss@@ essions than a kind of comfort , &quot; We@@ z says .
that is with me as a collectors so and I think it is so many people .
it is a simple way to deal spirit@@ ually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are a workforce from a platform stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people bought a record last month they haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the survey also found that 41 % have a turn@@ tables that they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record , do not have a record player .
at this point of the news report I would probably look very worried while I lost a stack to Bos@@ sa Nova Kom@@ pil@@ es .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( data count : three men of middle ages ) has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone came here recently , and said , &quot; I have no record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead Schall@@ platte so that I can make it into the shelf . &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it is definitely going .
more productive , less musicians .
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , which slowly come to clean .
f@@ ender , dedicated to the record almost an entire floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I am pur@@ ge .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , te@@ ens and women aged middle ages .
even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts the latest syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ tet pop instead of experimental jazz we@@ ars from the speakers - it is good to see such di@@ vers@@ ität in the customer .
none of them looks very lon@@ ely , but brand psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to det@@ ectable if you stand next to somebody for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around for a few minutes in business and consider the Vari@@ ety of the plates for sale .
it rather makes a man@@ ne@@ quin as a large shopping basket .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , therefore , collecting boards are no real option , it says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or any way , but the beauty of plat@@ ens is ... &quot; it drives with a loved sigh@@ s .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I &apos;m giving the note , the jeans @-@ Hot@@ pants , I watched a group of young te@@ ens that group themselves for a moment by Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter think to buy a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a stair@@ case , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential boards for an average collection .
nobody sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some as far as far as it is impossible to express them .
it is pure &quot; record @-@ art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry , and some customers could send to the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as boards .
even though my research tests revealed that the results of You@@ go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record @-@ loving girls who exist in reality , record shops and in On@@ line@@ for@@ en exist .
these people probably work hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the bum@@ ble@@ bees through record shops on Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while star@@ ing the star@@ ing views of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator , who rises nothing of the shoulders of middle @-@ aged men .

French court re@@ jects offer of demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of pro@@ vision@@ ally shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , who live in thousands of refugees .
in a court hearing this week , the authorities were argu@@ ing that the state should be able to disman@@ tle 72 provisional businesses in which persons within the camp &apos;s goods , selling cigarettes to energy drinks , sell bar@@ ber services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would be a parallel economy , which would not be paid for tax , and provide a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals provided by the nation@@ ally supported union and other groups , not enough foods for growing numbers would offer .
they led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often would offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dish in L@@ ille decided that there were no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 provisional businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais &quot; pre@@ fecture &quot; were absolutely comprehen@@ sible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes , and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just people who live &quot; in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers are offering .
one of the places that was threatened by the precip@@ itation was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des camp , which is gener@@ alized and served 200 meals a day , English and French classes and an advice to asylum items for the hundreds of protection needy , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
in a letter to The Guardian , it was said that the closure had been &quot; for this children of a disaster , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really difficult for me to comment on the time of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to analyse in peace , which they had led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
at the time World Cup in October in Qatar , Martin actually wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will see everything exactly what we have changed in the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the en@@ forcement trailer
Germany R@@ aser has to set itself on the next generation of speed : in different states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash units will be tested , which are particularly effective for temp@@ o heal@@ thier .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic en@@ forcement of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used as an accident on accident areas , where it would be dangerous for mobile monitoring by the police .
for example , on highway construction or a gentle bridges , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with a stationary bl@@ itter for compliance with speed limit .
a lasting mobile building can be too dangerous or consuming .
the en@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days when the case data is transmitted via a modem .
with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be recorded via several tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limits as well as flow rate to time , road strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the highly driven state , one can move the tra@@ ilers with each car with trailer hook .
so that it is not easy to put down , it is lowered into the measuring system , so that the wheels will disappear in the arm@@ oured and by the way , even a non @-@ sided external cover disappear .
furthermore , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the Bl@@ itter from V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used .
foreign authorities are also fl@@ ashes with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces of ordered , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain pic@@ ks silver at 7 @-@ spe@@ ru@@ g@@ by , after Fiji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came to the final on Thursday evening at a rup@@ ting stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in De@@ od@@ oro Stadium .
in Fiji , a master@@ class presented in the handling , side step@@ ping , reproduction , liner and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic Medal of any color .
the defeat was swe@@ pt through the non @-@ bad consol@@ ation prize of silver medals - UK fourth on that day - and they could certainly be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in semi @-@ final on the same day could fall on them in the finals .
but in this form , in this form , in this form a 15 @-@ man team would have been defeated .
it could be for GB a consol@@ ation - but it probably won &apos;t be that at least a Br@@ ite will hang on a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss Ben Ryan , former boss for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult way behind .
eight years ago she lost every game in Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they just lost one .
this cap will hurt , but the progress is amazing .
in Fiji the attacks started and started the attacks of G@@ BS .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and co . next , one would run into moving buses . the World Series winner went out 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au went down in the corner .
with another four minute play@@ time Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another assault from the right corner that he shi@@ fted .
12 @-@ 0 and GB have hardly got the ball .
a h@@ ic@@ ra@@ ped T@@ ackle Drop just stops the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third gate but it has not stopped in Fiji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua caught a touch down in the right corner and there was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the revival and there was still a minute season ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ aches by further weak Tac@@ cl@@ ings of the UK teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is like I was born in Fiji that 7 to play while UK still had to se@@ eded .
it is like that .
GB led basic changes to the half @-@ time and completed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji .
Dan N@@ orton started an attempt to GB , made a Touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long for long in favor of the South Se@@ as , whose fans sang , b@@ anners and dancing on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame put the i dot dot with another attempt in the last seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounds , the Fi@@ j@@ is sh@@ rou@@ ched and de@@ pressed the GB cr@@ ushing down in the lawn .
past days , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain urged South Africa into a tight half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - British transformation of difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half of the front , but Dan N@@ orton took the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ eighth team secured the prize - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning Inspi@@ red by the cancer of the trainer to the rowing win
there will be no more strict gold than with these games and that wants to be called .
from the first strokes to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , which will go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional importance in her golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who were sitting on the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was present as her as the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the two without tax wife in a row , the first women in the history of the British sport , which laid down such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all its 3@@ 9.@@ 19 un@@ lawful use , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant athl@@ ete that gli@@ des over the surface with the elegance of pigs , which is not reflected the type of tri@@ um .
behind each gold in rowing , there is a batt@@ ali@@ on to consent hel@@ pers that make the difference , and there was no more comfortable than the coach , who would not survive this day at all , when it was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had the bladder cancer , the oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do that , it spreads out everywhere .
it would have been a rather narrow situation .
it changes a bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was fortunate that he could be in early 2014 , outside the season , could begin the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that is the right term under such circumstances .
I needed the money , so I had to go better for me soon .
it was an incen@@ tive .
I was at the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
so it begins .
rowing is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the in@@ fertility of victory , their first thoughts on Williams who spent a ner@@ ven@@ ous morning to talk a little more than usual and thus trying to process his own fears .
St@@ anning , who was a leader in the Royal artill@@ ery regim@@ ent in an deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was a emotional wreck this week . that &apos;s maybe something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much me that means how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would have no one , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I could not have a better person to work or want a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark were joined , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were stuck at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to ignore it .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make something great .
we wanted no fireworks today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a time for a year before making decisions more about its future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week at a wedding , your own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve back@@ end .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years , exemplary for clarity
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ emeyer group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , retired .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian &quot; exemplary . &quot;
a small limited drinking water @-@ purpose association as a role model for large water producers .
so there was some time ago in the origin@@ alt@@ on in a contribution of Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
a little later the water forum declared the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken the ken@@ nel .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ ing group was &quot; Bavaria far as exemplary . &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years old for the signing of the staff , 28 years as managing director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association with headquarters in Kot@@ t@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes around 150@@ 000 cubic meters of water annually , sup@@ plying 32 places and ham@@ let with about 5500 inhabitants .
the communities of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of B@@ aun@@ ach .
for further cities and municipalities , there are water supply contracts .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner &apos;s Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller has been hired as a water@@ front in 1985 and was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks are very diverse and they extend from water management and maintenance activities , the bud@@ get@@ ary plans , calculation of fees and contributions to week@@ days on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events , she called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , fund@@ raising processes in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the high container ( 1999 ) , the new creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the renov@@ ations of water pipes .
I have not given any breast@@ feeding and I have always recorded new developments , because water may cover our lives and drinking water the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ atio , she praised Gö@@ llers , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has used a lot of heart fl@@ ashes for its water @-@ purpose and he has been living right with the water @-@ purpose and as if it would be his own company .
a few weeks ago , he has allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ ing group to nit@@ rate lowering in front of the water forum of the district Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller s@@ cent@@ red praised the Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best b@@ aker and he was a faithful ank@@ le .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as the highlights from its point of view , he described the well @-@ structure and re@@ structure of the ge@@ aring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipes on the high reservoir at Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a 3rd January . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here , at minus 17 degrees , we had to work throughout the night so that the towns could be supplied with water .
even the supply of Neu@@ brunn was also possible to maintain , because it filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with s@@ qui@@ ets .
the management of the tip of drinking water was handed over to Daniel falls from Lau@@ ter , who joins the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
the Sop@@ rano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko openly goes with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; they must have courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the medicine made great progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 year old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Corriere della Sera &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the disease had been known to her son , they believed they die .
however , the eight year old Ti@@ ago went well ahead and learn privately in New York where it is the best therapist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something that is two years back when I sang along the Milan Scala , he remembers nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Netanyahu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est man on earth .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man sho@@ ots on his partner
on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man caught in a multi @-@ family home in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) in his partner country and wounded them deadly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself with us and stated that his li@@ fel@@ ess was shot dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator was on the escape , after him a public face .
meanwhile , Sven S. could go on the road by car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 m tall , muscular , brown @-@ burnt and has a glass .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
it is , however , a few years old .
in the meantime , the man we@@ ars a gl@@ at@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon , if the police wear .
if you see Sven S. , he will call 110 .
the police speaks of a &quot; Association of Association . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator 1981 .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck did not want to do any data to the T@@ ather@@ course or the relationship between the perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; it is a killing sensation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more we do not say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police officer in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the ey@@ e@@ witnesses , a special operation command ( SEK ) was at the crime scene .
steel - light view for German steel industry
the fluctu@@ ated and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions @-@ height .
financial bur@@ dens , threatened by the industry from the green power plant , are from the table .
it remains in the deliver@@ ance of the renewable energy deployment for the so @-@ called independent production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Economics : Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German General newspaper &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday issue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really glad that we could finally reach negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the European Commission , the European Commission initially had planned to apply the steel manufacturer , the gases coming from the blast furnace for their own consumption , to K@@ asse .
the steel industry accounted for additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry association .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , there is now an agreement with the EU Commission to talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when generators in the steel works will be replaced , all an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but these will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for self @-@ production generation .
thus , the status quo will be largely fixed to the previous scheme .
a special meaning has the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more needs to follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IG Metall @-@ chief Jörg Hofmann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated at the reform of the emission allow@@ ance &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said IG Metall @-@ chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has suffered under excess capacities and a considerable pressure .
last year , the situation intensi@@ fied , as the world &apos;s biggest producers in China , faced with the fain@@ ting domestic demand for large steel on the global market .
European manufacturers t@@ oss Chinese steel so@@ umping prices .
over this spring , the situation has relaxed .
on an imp@@ acted import tari@@ ffs on import @-@ steel effect , the other economic prospects of China have hung up in China .
un@@ clear , as sustain@@ ably the pricing is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
finally , prices would be stagn@@ ated again .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult position with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp didn &apos;t want to exclu@@ de the works of single works as well .
at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tons , they produced less crude steel than in the previous year , as the economic unification steel was closed on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the amount moved back to each other in the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association is calculated in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with an increasing output .
community , spirit , health : singing sen@@ iors well
the singing was accompanied by Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp . as a young girl she was in school choir , in Leh@@ ra@@ e study she finished the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; it moves me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall live , she says .
she does something good in the side of her health and spirit .
for singing , singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German senior League .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular interaction , the sen@@ iors can bind and maintain social contacts .
for frequently , social and family structures solve the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; talking and organize , to be able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of interaction . &quot;
singing can be ti@@ ring in the positive sense , writes H@@ ac@@ kler .
they conv@@ ey a deep and controlled breathing .
whoever calls his lungs regularly , does not get so fast in everyday life .
even if it comes to get the sound of the voice in the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in older people , singing often has a very special effect , &quot; Ursula L@@ enz , &quot; says the Federal Association of sen@@ iors @-@ organisations .
in the older generations the joint singing had a lot of job vac@@ ancy , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often observed that singing or listening of songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , people are dis@@ infected by himself in long periods .
in singing , the head will also require a special achievement , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time , concentrate on his own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a major cog@@ nitive challenge .
just older people who live alone , do not only practice themselves to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in choir , writes H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em is also growing in choir as well .
to show itself : if I have long enough for something , I will boost better and watch over me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent , will betra@@ y L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 sin@@ king people , who is listening to it when there is a sound next to it ?
looking for the appropriate offer , senior citizens offer various possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
someone is singing from the inner circle in a senior group , you can easily join in .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the cho@@ irs in the surroundings .
who wants to sing in a church choir , can turn right to the church or church leader .
there is also many senior cho@@ irs to be found on the Internet .
if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for assistance in the Internet .
anyone who lust has to sing , should necessarily be connected to a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - it applies to any age .
cats react sensi@@ bler as a tom@@ cat on sk@@ ie the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hannover , which effect has the herds of cat bab@@ ys to adult animals .
to her surprise , the male didn &apos;t even get cold . however , they always stopped the difference to the females .
female cats may recognize the arous@@ al degree of cat bab@@ ys on the building of the little ones .
they react to Lau@@ te of K@@ itt@@ ens on Lau@@ te of K@@ itt@@ ens who voted in great need , like scientists from the Medical School of Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
males also react to the rod of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; evi@@ dently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ ths of less and heavily damaged young are either non @-@ det@@ achable or not of meaning , &quot; the biolog@@ ist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding said from the MH@@ H .
she is the first director of the study published on this Friday in the specialist magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kit@@ ten scre@@ ams is different with the ur@@ gency of their assistance .
a total of nine adult males and eight females were observed from the livestock production of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a herd of little ones , which were taken from the litter box for three minutes , and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were faced with scre@@ aming of stronger kit@@ ten , which were also lifted .
the researchers maintain their results despite the low sample for meaningful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females even those who had not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned swi@@ fter to speakers , when this rod played the very rainy kit@@ ten .
this ability may be born or developed with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males ever responded to anyway , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby sounds .
also , some studies showed that women responded well @-@ sensitive to infants , whether they were already mothers or not , the biolog@@ ist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ cht@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the unique football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ cht@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey will take place an important football game again .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clearly : &quot; business as usual &quot; is told .
even when the expi@@ ration request , after the overthrow of the crash in July , the government , the daily life of normal cal@@ endars should not be imp@@ aired .
this does not apply to those suspected of having suspected of the movement of pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempt of cleaning .
even before the football is not taken .
the prosecutor &apos;s office filed an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ cht@@ r .
according to the latter , the Sü@@ cht@@ r was accused of being a member of a terrorist group in America .
the p@@ endants of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , is said to be responsible for the coup attempt .
although valid for 90 days , the state of emergency was still valid until October , but in fact , this has no effect on the lives of the Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is declared on public places throughout the country , Erdo@@ gan is declared on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - as the whole country - split in tra@@ ilers and opponent &apos;s enemy .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
however , at the end of the Turks , however , in view of dramatic experience in history , the strict ref@@ usal of military coup is given .
even fans agree - no matter whether their heart beat Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
the gala &quot; gala &quot; winner takes place especially on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
the Köl@@ ner exhibited its sporty value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitors , the 31 year old finished his first time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory buffer .
the newspaper &quot; fan@@ atics &quot; che@@ ered : &quot; he was the best in place . &quot;
he finished the season in an outstanding way and secured the trop@@ hy .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory degree .
after the round @-@ kno@@ ck@@ out in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; went early in the Europe League early .
in the Sü@@ ver Li@@ g it was only to rank 6 .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we made it , and this is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the game year was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season op@@ eners , the Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g Tor@@ que king , laid the base on the 14th title .
this is also the reason that fans continue to return to the return of the 31 year olds .
at the same time , AC Florence had agreed under contract and would only rent out Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario want to come to us , he only must say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club chief F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we would have to be willing to pay for roughly one third of his on 7.5 million euros in the estimated annual season , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; his salary in Florence will not be paid . &quot;

Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian sen@@ iors injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand , with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday early .
she had suffered the chi@@ ves and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again .
her hom@@ ebo@@ und voyage is scheduled for the beginning of September .
whether of the further explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on , also Austrian citizens are still un@@ clear .
the State Department arise in permanent contact with local authorities , such as bran@@ ll .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hua H@@ in was first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a slide .
according to police , a Thai police were killed and about 20 people were injured , among them the Austrian woman , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
on Friday early morning , two divisions left high , and a further man was killed according to the authorities .
the bomb explosion was also reported by Ph@@ uk@@ et in the morning .
at Det@@ onation in the near of the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong , the taxi driver was injured after police reports .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb planted a municipal staff .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ iting point has gone into the air in a flower@@ y flower before the re@@ four of the coastal police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations required in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast several injured .
they go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , it was named .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks bear the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said armies of Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday early journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early to express yourself about possible motives , but probably the acts of Muslim rebels .
Thai media were also wanted to recognize the attacks in the attacks which is typical for the bomb attacks in the south of the country .
however , the Thai police declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is just local Sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is rather likely that the bombs were laid out by the ruling military jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities have received secret references to imp@@ ending attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact date and the locations .
the group is still un@@ clear , which group behind the attacks .
the police reported their officials throughout the country to en@@ force security around important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment areas .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are usually not al@@ igned against tourists .
in Hua H@@ in lies a palace that was used by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j over the years .
following the reason of bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends its homepage to make the instructions of Thai security agencies necessarily .
high security risk ( level 3 ) paid for the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani , and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
after disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no necessary trips in these provinces .
increased security risk ( level 2 ) paid for the rest of the country .
a few days after a controversial referendum held on Thursday and Friday , a Constitution worked out by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military a large impact on the military in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said that bombs have been an attempt to sti@@ cking chaos while the country moving towards stability , to improve economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which had taken hold of power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , holds himself good to bring the kingdom to stability and order .
however , in the extreme south of the country , however , it has not managed to get a grip on the country for years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago , in Bangkok , they were killed by a popular Hindu shr@@ ine for 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the country &apos;s younger history .
the right &quot; identification movement &quot; is in the Vis@@ ier of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
after several country offices , the Con@@ stitu@@ ent Con@@ stitu@@ tions have also placed the Group under observation .
&quot; we see the &apos; Identi@@ ty movement &apos; movement for ordering against the freedom of democratic principles , &quot; said Con@@ vic@@ tor Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German Press agency in Berlin .
thus , immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East will be diff@@ used in the extrem@@ ist way .
therefore we observe the movement now .
the &quot; identi@@ fiable movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ ticul@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of their own identity . &quot;
constitutional monarchy in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; identification . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said his authority has dealt close with the country &apos;s decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &apos; identity movement &apos; trying to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ vic@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts to address them with you@@ thful speech , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the daily Islam@@ ists as well as rule of extreme .
that is not a bet@@ ting advertisement for their own thing .
propaganda is supposed to talk more emotional .
young people are sus@@ cep@@ tible to sus@@ cep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
last , it had given reports from several federal states on contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; to AF@@ D politicians .
ma@@ y@@ ate said , he did not have knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are relevant only from a certain point .
it depends whether the respective party - in this case , the AF@@ D - by certain people , which are extrem@@ ist , changes its target and extrem@@ ist extrem@@ ist .
the decisive point is , if such people have to control the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a view of the significant increase of rectangular crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee information , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak in this context yet of new right @-@ hand terrorism .
but we have observed in recent years that there may be righ@@ tist structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Freit@@ al Group .
it may well be that other righ@@ tist group@@ ings or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee court or attacks from other right @-@ wing motives .
however , a clear or European @-@ wide control of f@@ og@@ r@@ or@@ ism is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were worried about that many commerci@@ als went to the account of people who had not listed in the right scene in the right scene . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the Tat@@ ras attacks against asylum seek@@ ers were not known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; many people have committed crimes committed to criminal conviction that were politically in@@ different , or , for example , CD@@ U , SPD , or Left who have been radic@@ alised or radic@@ alised as the CD@@ U , SPD , or Left . &quot;

in social networks , Hab@@ te then became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended up with a back@@ drop of 48 seconds and finished the 5@@ 9th place of 59 .
but it was not just a sporty figure that attracted the attention of international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old take part in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian was entitled to a special award from the international swimming federation .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ min@@ ted countries more known .
as in Eth@@ op@@ ia , most athletes run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first names made the lap .
some media recorded him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL der W@@ al . &quot;
based on a &quot; welfare state &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; The Sun &quot; was made with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; about him .
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of fre@@ estyle , no role played .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the eel &quot; have also been dra@@ gged .
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i participated for media attention .
unforgettable , the performance of the bu@@ cket of A@@ equ@@ atorial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meters of fre@@ estyle alone .
Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old spent eight months before the Olympia , and had never completed a long distance before the contest .

two of the occup@@ ants had suffered severe injury , the police reported .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ apor@@ ate their data according to the opposite direction .
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a speaker of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the people couldn &apos;t leave the bus alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the passengers .
six ambul@@ ances and ambul@@ ances came to an accident on the state road 2 .
the last travelers were brought back from a liner bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ist district of P@@ ew@@ sum .

the investig@@ ators requested the det@@ ach@@ ers and possible witnesses to report with the police .
the fees per cubic meter waste amount to the area of the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ fare 3,@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 Euro ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the water charge fee will then be increased by the latest if appropriate improvement is necessary .
after a relevant calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf lies at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meters .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported that the budget of the budget was established through the governor of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these waste water facilities .
based on the legal foundation , Kas@@ endorf is oblig@@ ated to cover the facilities covered .
from 1 October 2016 , citizens and industrial companies from the world of Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg are forced to attack deeper into the pur@@ se .
the rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Head of Herbert Schmidt &apos;s Board of Directors , a new escal@@ ation of charges for san@@ itation systems was necessary .
the period from October 2016 to September 2020 may also be over@@ seen and covers from the previous calendar period .
therefore , Schmidt founded the grave increases , therefore , that there are relatively small water san@@ itation systems with very low water san@@ itation , which fly between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for repair of several thousand Euros would occur serious .
moreover , water san@@ itation is slightly decl@@ ining in all three plants .
furthermore , in the previous calendar period , all three plants are not last due to its age rehabilitation and repair applications in a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the equipment for Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt noted that in the se@@ wage system Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to an damage .
in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ ding , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and the first clari@@ fication of the pond had to be prevented after almost 20 years of operation , the se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge and an additional aer@@ ation facility will be installed in order to keep the water legal specifications in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; to these extraordinary expenses , the continuing treatment and maintenance costs were considered to be considered in the new calculations period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs due to the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 clearly below the current level .
stone houses made clear that at low age se@@ wage treatment in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance . &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt , the market town of major entertainment costs in the se@@ wage systems remained spar@@ ed in the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned facilities will continue to be continued after view of stone houses on the duration , especially since the supply area of the waste water @-@ purpose unit Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al could not be expanded because it is about de@@ contamination facilities .

Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian caric@@ ature critic@@ ises
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it &apos;s un@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool , the Snap@@ chat allows for about 150 million daily users who change reality and to play with identi@@ ties on such a way that borders the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into an pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are non @-@ bloo@@ ded , stand@@ alone tools which generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all abor@@ tions are to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have drawn cri@@ tique in the past , in which they were accused that the app would propag@@ ate Black@@ face or white skin as beauty ideal .
when this week proposed a filter , which gave them sl@@ ush@@ y , false teeth and ev@@ oked che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ ed . &quot;
they asked whether these repeated controversy had been reported to a larger problem , that the company has di@@ vers@@ ität .
the news and the indig@@ nation were spread far on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company provided an ap@@ ologies : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders that have experienced rac@@ ism , the filter remembered the bre@@ ach c@@ lich@@ és .
other loans the anim@@ e comparison decided .
in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American student , twe@@ aks over the photos were widely circul@@ ated that the filter was &quot; inj@@ uri@@ ous and m@@ ild@@ ly said unpleasant . &quot;
they added that &quot; it would be difficult to argue with the comparison of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ly @-@ assured , but that the yellow @-@ sigh@@ ting has been moved into the sw@@ ing@@ est extre@@ m .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crossed this cultural heritage .
the American culture seems to be involved in endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we keep all in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big crowd young people - who are in terms of race as their older counterpart - could rather expect sensi@@ bility to expect .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters a picture generated that for a user , it is much more difficult that such things could be un@@ noticed when it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu decided to work as a product manager and engineer to delete her Snap@@ chat account , others urged to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she should reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices in Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the big part of white , only male leaders and ended its set with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they may take such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions in which they are safe or comfortable in what they say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat has not left un@@ answered .

military lead to ISIS intelligence information , rest@@ ores Committee of Congress
military members of the United States Central Command changed educational information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it allowed the actual states on site for a committee in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the republi@@ can members of the armed forces , secret service centres and the military personnel , reported of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence analyst , reported as su@@ peri@@ ors their ass@@ essments on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news information collected by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander in a regular basis , a posi@@ tional picture of the American efforts against terrorism as they had allowed the actual states on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted a newspaper article the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
the management errors in Cent@@ Com extends up to the top tip of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed potential problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct references to change government tips on Obama administration , it shows how analysts predi@@ ct the pressure from its laws , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements , and statements before the Congress was significantly more positive than the facts &quot; presented to the report . &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com An@@ al@@ ger announced that a military recovery of Mos@@ sul@@ s can already begin in April or May 2015 .
the Muslim , second @-@ largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , republi@@ can Congress of Kansas , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 until the mid @-@ year 2015 , the points of Central Command changed the down@@ stream reports to reduce the risk of ISIS to Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force in life after it was played that analysts took care in manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigation .
in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports are underway in the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Defence Ministry .
the democratic members of the message committee published their findings on Thursday , who agreed with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created a limited process for preparing sal@@ ut@@ ational ass@@ essments to Isi@@ l and Iraqi security services &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the highest ranking of the Democ@@ rat in the Committee , Member of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff announced in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of subsequent reports , &quot; dis@@ rupted the mor@@ als under analysts and &quot; overwhel@@ med little space for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats they gave no evidence on an intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st in terms of a &quot; particular political opinions . &quot;
preliminary results of the con@@ gresses were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
in the past August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor , which received complaints by Cent@@ Com .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press review of the Pentagon , gave evidence that the Ministry of Defence could not comment on Congress , while investig@@ ating the general inspection is still underway .
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes quite diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the Ministry of Intelligence and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues in the national defence . &quot;
the investigations have adopted re@@ perc@@ ussions about the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now made by a growing number of relatives of the Defence Ministry ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of last year &apos;s accus@@ ations have failed , however , President Obama refused to leave the Central Command for the military operations of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the cri@@ tique concerning the Secret Information about the Islamic State reminds of more than ten years ago when Cent@@ Com analyst , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , ob@@ serves some of the recommendations of many analysts only a small cre@@ ek in Iraq and a little time to face up to the consequences of the 2003 invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker following speci@@ fying government positions that had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group received no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group since they had taken this provisional refin@@ eries in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this realization was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ re@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ature because of his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the United States win fourth match in the hockey field of women , a show@@ down with Britain before
a day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates of the American F@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , this does not know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are still in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place that were un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two will receive the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed will take the strong Dutch somewhat longer in the way that the other group will guide .
as always the game is going out on Saturday , the Americans have caused a surprising effort by their success story , four years after the last London games finished in the last 12 squares .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ derer in hands ( their two older sisters played the Sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national player of the USA , the youngest in history of the team .
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , since they could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team passed away everything .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things for better .
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said .
we did not have the work@@ around in London , which we now have .
we can carry the ru@@ d@@ der completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the cake in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the se@@ am area .
India had been without victory in the tournament without victory in the game , but the team showed surprisingly heavy and kept the playing of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
she completed a Sprint with a flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and lu@@ pin the ball in the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez did the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in any of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
am@@ id@@ st the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ins
wherever you are , as late it is , the Olympic Games are .
the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s events feel steady and in@@ escap@@ able , a rapid relay between competition and pursu@@ it .
it is as if the Olympic F@@ ack@@ el himself is a burning rod , which will protect from cross@@ bow swi@@ mmer to Turner for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t switch on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queu@@ e , without Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dimples , would certainly have been sent to Prime Time , set up by sponsors and feel @-@ being , if it would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even f@@ real .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline .
the Olympic flame does not lit any event .
further from the center , some in the shadow are the sports that are not broad@@ ly acknowledged : aerial guns , ar@@ chery , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always swim the breast@@ swimming , and may reign for a long time .
but if I just want to make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me leave the attention on the dis@@ crete charm of trampoline .
although the Tramp@@ ol@@ ines have been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years had perceived that many , I had questioned , did not know that it is at all an Olympic port .
it could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the United States sent athletes to competition , it has never gained a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and made it a athl@@ ete until 2012 , who managed it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans who share the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain outside side , partly because it sounds for an un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ School than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only a horse enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ary tre@@ mor of his never s@@ wollen tu@@ b@@ alls - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ asi@@ um and diving , which combines two types of sports which are essentially un@@ united .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means a lot like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rising winners jumping on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , real and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
according to official documents for execution , difficulty level , level of difficulty and &quot; flight time &quot; are assessed .
two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio against each other .
the common Olympic V@@ ektor is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ on hop@@ pers must go on in their quest for gold , qu@@ icker , upward and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and back , up and down on the playground .
they are not only hunting the finish line or the initial wall , but also a further cave goal : in the world or the Olympic champion .
the targeted pursu@@ it is no@@ bel , very admi@@ red , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even stir any viewers to tears .
but it is also what I &apos;m feeling in listening to this games as a little ti@@ res@@ ome .
the trampoline offers a breathing spell .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ un@@ ned , seem@@ ingly he@@ avi@@ os like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes down , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolves into the distance , just the dre@@ ad@@ ful , elegant up@@ lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition could only be with the Olympic Games .
the pre@@ limin@@ aries and final stages of women will take place on Friday afternoon , streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
NBC will radi@@ ate the final positions as part of a follow @-@ off block at two days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ mania they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to over@@ see in general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase of consciousness is only achieved by anxiety and objec@@ ti@@ fying male athletes - as it proposed the male U.S. Turner according to The Wall Street Journal , then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expected to rin@@ ses his following air , new fans .
&quot; a generation demonstrated &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is the United States
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators urge political changes in Ethiopia , strug@@ gled to the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that zig prot@@ esters have been killed during cl@@ ashes with the police .
is Ethiopia straight together ?
over the past ten years , there was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a strong ban on the West with a fast growing economy .
but in the last months , protests against the government , the government and continued to spread themselves out more .
last week thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less , according to human rights organisations .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen were shot and killed on an un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
some videos on the protests , probably from the last or earlier this year , show how security people beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
the UN Authority for Human Rights needs now a prospective investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to hold this country and will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the Horn of Africa from the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely together with the Ethiop@@ ian in order to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded rapidly at a remarkable pace .
his infrastructure has dras@@ tically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia had all other than a role model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually given the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted where dis@@ sidents were effectively taken to silence .
many were sent into exile or prison , or driven into the wilderness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except to prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian .
the entire youth prot@@ esting .
a generation demonstrated .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land use up to the dig@@ ging in relation to power the ruling coalition .
after a widespread critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , the tensions continue along the border of Eritrea ; a struggle against this z@@ ack@@ y , disputed line requested in June hundreds of life .
analysts predi@@ ct that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front , which had more or less forced in recent years , could use turbul@@ ence and could be armed again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ ing after years of mine an@@ kles must now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smart phones .
only in recent years there were very many Ethiop@@ ian in the position to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones have always been more common and improved the Internet services .
even if the government closed access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via the internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave them that they were so protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ n@@ ici@@ ties in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
since the end of all , the Am@@ har@@ as , who originate from Eth@@ op@@ ia , mainly from Christian floo@@ ding in politics and economy , while they caught the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and live in low@@ lands .
but this also changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , who make up about 6 per cent of the population and who are dominant in the military , in the intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was sentenced to death in a non @-@ public condition in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister .
he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts predi@@ ct that he was particularly engaged in it , early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and special contractors to use to process opponents and make it harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is lacking in this fundamental idea , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Ab@@ di said , a conflict analyst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ clear reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , from the northern Ethiop@@ ian region , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts predi@@ ct that he does not enjoy confidence from the Tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many fear that the outcome will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections were prot@@ ested by the government , which were seem@@ ingly stolen by the government and stolen them afterwards .
during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it were less than in the past few months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as new comm@@ uter train , as well as for its measur@@ able progress in the poverty line .
but obviously this does not prevent the intention of the internal mis@@ concep@@ tions of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ian city , of Tig@@ ray managed businesses and hatred toward the Tig@@ ray is always more common in the social media .
analysts predi@@ ct that protests in the United States and other Western allies are bringing in a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ ger flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West definitely wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to join his ally in a volatile area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin Gr@@ at@@ ration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declared his asser@@ tion Obama was established ISIS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to sc@@ atter the last controversy that surro@@ unds his campaign by attacking his campaign , President Obama and Hillary Clinton had been the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously .
this clari@@ fication cast new questions on the communication skills of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , whether he was able to communicate and comprehen@@ sible to the American public .
it also brings his mi@@ stre@@ ites who endeav@@ our to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protecting , to explain the actual position that he could not have meant .
after having made a campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump had made reference to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and insi@@ sted on interviews that he really did not intend to suggest the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day that Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to we@@ aken the statement by claiming that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate wanted nothing to know about it .
the last storm of criticism comes down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to focus on the focus of his campaign on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton thought the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject .
he warned about Twitter , that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and found that he had found his speech .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
in late July , he moved out strong criticism when he said that Russians should cut Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he said &quot; Natur@@ ally I thought the ar@@ ctic table . &quot;
this method allows to post@@ p@@ one the lingu@@ istic boundaries in politics and return to ruin .
&quot; I think it is one of its methods to test such as certain messages from his fans as they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; set forth &quot; according to what reaction falls . &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , observed the language of both candidates .
but I think he is smart enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of sharp@@ ened the clay for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted an excellent sound because his re@@ frac@@ tive values are further backward .
a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday , showed a tour with a huge margin in the North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is tried not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to understand his testimony or mis@@ understood its hum@@ our .
but while he increases the focus of attention in the past few months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze has brought out his loyal fellow workers into the un@@ comfortable situation , ir@@ respective of how prov@@ ok@@ ant his testimony must also be .
Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent owners , had great effort to defend candidates today in an CNN @-@ interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ uman &apos;s statements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ bit@@ ors , completely false and therefore it happened because he moved the troops out of Iraq .
most of the Main@@ stream Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government served as an outdoor minist@@ erial government , Clinton allowed ISIS to spread themselves , to spread the situation in the N@@ ear East under control .
before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump put up his attacks on the media and threw them before , on each of his words , and to be pri@@ eved against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked about Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps ap@@ ologies as only one thing that he was in@@ capable of the presidential office .
once more about the price of the market , café comes back in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a ashamed café in William@@ sburg , in which one could only pay cash , but had no Wi @-@ Fi but for 15 years a good coffee .
of course it was pushed by the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front .
the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , made in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in cup@@ cakes .
indigenous people acted as the last loss in a growing city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel exemp@@ t and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is change , it is also new creation .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has wi @-@ fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
coffee is still good too .
the new owner of Ver@@ b is a Cisco Rodriguez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafes , owner and managing director of the new cafés .
he started working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered a client to provide money for a new foreign policy , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodriguez , 36 , held many things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment :
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and sour onions .
there is natural en@@ code .
the café serves no beer more , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodriguez said that he not@@ ices a st@@ acked current to old ancest@@ or .
&quot; many old customers were also pushed by prices from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg , and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after she had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way forward .
after the ver@@ b closed , she gave a while the Kaffe@@ et@@ r@@ ink , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear to me that it was the coffee and the culture in the ver@@ b that liked me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee again , even if they arrived in this day instead of their usual iced coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the start of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and ordered in@@ sof@@ ter always .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a s@@ wis@@ s watch and they prepare my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bath with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and recording new ingredients in the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes he changes his cycle Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodriguez said that he won &apos;t have a p@@ enny about it that the soap store has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , a special soap for so@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the cafes as an ingredient .
&quot; I think we &apos;re still going to go on their offer , &quot; said Rodriguez .
and the traditional , Polish residents Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodriguez and Rodriguez said that he has planned to make them soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ locally would like to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to an adjacent building .
for many customers , a new ver@@ b goes out to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a certificate and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that breaking of the location and ordering a new coffee as a hom@@ ec@@ oming approach .
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;

President Roosevelt had a Fai@@ ble for refined Del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen at Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water slide soup .
his menu on this day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as a dessert a p@@ ud@@ ding p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man said .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights , and are both food histori@@ ans .
Co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; about life in a residential house at the Lower East Side .
its latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a reporter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ au@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em I@@ mb@@ al in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the IP@@ crash of 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a cream cheese with olive trees , while co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable dishes ate .
when the reporter ordered Hack@@ neys , this one found the couple for discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man said .
there were pean@@ ut bread , meat lo@@ af and bread bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap , that the ingredient is scattered .
imagine , so many peanuts to eat that they serve them as a dinner .
CO@@ E gr@@ in@@ box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have laid in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression was the table in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cook for male Fel@@ lowship and it was served fresh baked Past@@ els for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans that were sent to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; records the way in which the country left , not the slaughter land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time in which food for Americans was a central , respected subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talented Co@@ e why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as sharp as the new budget s@@ own : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and k@@ asser@@ ts were made to stap@@ le food , the K@@ asser@@ olle as &quot; wonderful way , food resi@@ due &quot; noted Zi@@ egel@@ one noted that coo@@ ks un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients could hide under a mu@@ d@@ dy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
meat , which was the center of the American cuisine for years , became a rarely ser@@ rated luxury .
pec@@ uli@@ ar bl@@ ends were tried , as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction came before taste or even healthy kitchen .
during their research for the book , which includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this ep@@ och , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was no popular addition to the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping .
as never before or since then , household appliances - among them Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 @-@ 1943 - the eating habits of the country .
by published recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become a &quot; budget policy &quot; and the challenge , p@@ amp@@ ons like cre@@ m@@ ite sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals to be justified .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical treats .
especially tasty are the reports about the government &apos;s answer to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ post@@ ure .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer house kitchen in his kitchen , he sp@@ itted as the million@@ th heavy man from the world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked the continental kitchen such as fish with cucum@@ ber , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in a nearly g@@ ilded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ king .
he was glorious real@@ ity .
perhaps President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to fit with his stomach .
as described in the book , as described in the book , there was no interest in flavors with Mrs. Roosevelt , that the White House brought the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most frequently prepared food . &quot;
many of the types from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food was rejected once the country came back to the legs .
the legacy , on our ongoing focus on calories and food , Zi@@ egel@@ man said , as well as science on food was applied .
the couple had to be understood at the writing of the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans &apos;s mother in law - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the cap of the wind .
after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they stri@@ pped and co@@ e a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pr@@ unes , the president Roosevelt at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a common trick to miss a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no proposed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ lu@@ ct@@ antly disp@@ le@@ ased a spo@@ ons in the t@@ amed , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it didn &apos;t tasted bad .
CO@@ E took a supplement for three times .
like a Can @-@ Do Bud@@ dy , he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set his own life on the game to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar dedicated his life to man in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died at a facade attack on the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a Civil Protection Group , who had saved the lives of almost 60,000 people according to the picture newspaper .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own life on the game to pull people out of torn houses and to make first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil servant , which shows him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a house of ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians in the shining symbol of the grey war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as heroes , he never saw himself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said according to the image : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I die to save lives , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack , he talked in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have four facade bombs over the Alz@@ adia district , which was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now remove the po@@ ison@@ ous ves@@ tiges of the bomb , lest the children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; c@@ ites the picture his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest flu@@ x is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland shar@@ ks usually come only in winter to the surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and is swimming with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land shar@@ ks get offspring at the age of 150 .
in the bottom of the North Atlantic ocean along the bottom of the North Atlantic along an hour , it is just 1,@@ 220 metres far .
only when it comes to it , the five meters long animal acceler@@ ates to sat@@ te 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed it is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this lon@@ el@@ iness shaped lifestyle appears , however , a pat@@ tern@@ ess seems to be a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case by a Greenland shar@@ k which could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Alexander Sch@@ adventure from the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic Research in Rostock this li@@ fes@@ pan , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Evol@@ u@@ tions@@ bi@@ ologist projected that Greenland shar@@ ks become cob@@ alt .
only missed the evidence .
Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , eventually they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coastal co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear in the surface mostly in the winter .
researchers at the lifestyle of Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie know researchers according to little .
her period of time , she , as she pointed out six animals with a transmitter .
however , this shar@@ ks make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another one had swallowed the pine no@@ bles of a young ic@@ ir@@ ons .
maybe they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream and seek Kad@@ aver , which tor@@ ates from higher water layers down@@ wards .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ tim@@ eters long , while the biggest reaches of 502 .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens of shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens emerg@@ es before the birth of shar@@ ks , which are contained in the proteins later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks were stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
after the early 1960s , their birth should therefore be worse as atomic w@@ aff@@ s experiments for larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere .
in the overall length of 220 cen@@ tim@@ eters , the lin@@ sen@@ ate contained a low surplus to carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it should have celebrated its 50th birthday at its investigation in 2012 .
all major Green@@ land@@ shar@@ ks had the normal Carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their lens core , which emerg@@ es by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 Clock for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland shar@@ ks showed an age of 335 years while the record gro@@ i with 502 Zen@@ tim@@ eters might even be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Green@@ lan@@ hai @-@ females get caught only then , when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to submit an old age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ tim@@ eters probably stood at the threshold for sexual maturity and his age with 156 years was determined , Greenland ha@@ ie with the reproduction obviously at least one and a half centuries .
this is also likely to be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live primarily in icy waters , is no coincidence .
the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland whale , in whose bacon gar@@ nished the neck of a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on top , was caught in front of Alaska .
through the low temperatures often the organism of the animals live on spar@@ ks .
so they mature later - and down slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , by which the animal has heat .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on as far as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Evol@@ u@@ tions@@ bi@@ ologist Sch@@ adventure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a very big animal should rather invest his resources in a long life . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the city of Main , with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , has the best chance to attract jobs and companies from London .
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt am most benef@@ ited from Bre@@ xit @-@ vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Comp@@ et@@ encies , Financial Markets and Real Estate markets of the I@@ W .
however , following a Bre@@ xit referendum , money houses may continue to operate from financial transactions throughout the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU passport , the admission in Great Britain has so far enough .
these are just big US banks .
several banks already announced jobs to move jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lob@@ by@@ word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is calculated by 10000 new jobs in five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , re@@ united the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the euro zone &apos;s largest banks , as well as other important authorities as the European insurance company E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Committee ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this is less important for the financial sector less important than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the bank@@ note is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Luxembourg , a large fund business , but as well as Dublin in the infrastructure are worse .
in Frankfurt , thanks to the great airport , Frankfurt be much easier to reach .
the city is also available with a slightly available office real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not as easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Seine , the Mi@@ xed for top @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than the Main .
moreover , Frankfurt offered a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as fewer crime .
in a ranking of management consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city rose to No.@@ 19 , Dublin on No.@@ 19 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if the quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its strong position as a financial position for the European domestic market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ref@@ uses to I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London , however , will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite a Bre@@ xit @-@ vote .
for that reason , the economic situation : in London , according to the numbers of Landesbank Her@@ aba in the end of 2015 , some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt , there were 6@@ 2500 people .

Clinton earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
Hillary Clinton publishes its tax return for 2015 on Friday , this was a $ 10,@@ 75 million for the Presi@@ dential candidate of the Democrats and their husband , an effective Federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Division ended $ 1 million for charity purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former Foreign Minister Bill Clinton generated an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster by Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declar@@ ations of the last ten years with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clinton &apos;s struggle in Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i published in a opinion .
in a sharp contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hi@@ des behind false pron@@ oun@@ cing and trace@@ ability regarding his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations , even though they are not obliged by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for ref@@ using a tax audit by tax authorities .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; Clinton wrote an election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the Presi@@ dential candidate of the Democrats .
on Thursday Michael Cohen , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Advisor to CNN said that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax tests are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , among others , also the republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already noted that his ref@@ usal questions regarding wealth , donations for charity organisations , his business entities , and various other compounds , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown on the topic and released a video on the Internet on Friday , in the high ranking of rep@@ ublic@@ ans Tr@@ ump to publish his tax statement .
on Thursday , she spoke the subject of a speech about the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate in the last decades has done and publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
POL@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump had not paid only very few taxes during the 1990s , and a economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyer and tax advis@@ ers that could be the case still .
Bundes@@ regul@@ ators have become a subject in the election campaign .
Clinton is providing a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would ensure that persons who pay more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election event for Hillary Clinton in the last week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for buff@@ ets , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here has its headquarters , Tr@@ ump to meet their tax declar@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had been under@@ gone an inspection of the IRS and I &apos;m afraid of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ t &apos;s campaign has released tax declar@@ ations back to 2007 .
the Clin@@ ton , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , has paid an effective Federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % .
the tax statement of the 2015 Clin@@ ton showed that this only USD 100 of their income were included as a wage , unlike the majority of all Americans .

Jewish Director proposes the Berlin Hotel , because Israeli di@@ alling code was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; re@@ jection - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media clock after he revealed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has no Israeli pre@@ fix , as it had requested Arabic guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Shoah &quot; made his anger in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed among countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel room .
how is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel on its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he received there , &quot; shot him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason behind it , dis@@ band@@ ed even more rage in the director .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre@@ fix is deleted , &quot; the employees of Lanz@@ mann was quoted .
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man named this a &quot; great confusion , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
that is really very sh@@ em@@ bodied .
the fact that this is carried out in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , even greater dis@@ grace .
no explanation for this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect that the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moves the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident dis@@ band@@ ed a pretty big reson@@ ance on the Internet , where the people all named a sc@@ andal .
some signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have been given the alleged objec@@ tions of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed of you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she named it in another post which was pointed out that the hotel that is on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly rejected all charges of accus@@ ations and called the incident . &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , the Mir@@ ror reports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has never been a direct order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel did not include in the rapid voting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds , that the country code is now added .

the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ bul@@ lets against prot@@ esters .
the difficulties started when police officers attempted to cast out the students that led the police rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in demonstrations in order to express their records through plans .
according to the Govern@@ ors of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300.000 students are being implemented to save money .

since the international sanctions against Iran , the interest in pages of Russian companies grew strongly in the country , divided the ambassador .
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are willing to provide access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; naturally , the further commercial building is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade agreement between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 fell by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and tot@@ alled $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade down@@ turn was reached by deliveries of machinery , motor vehicles and arms , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes out for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , Russian exports represented around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , first line of travel to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries that the tourist number in Russia is concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record number of ear@@ thly tourists in Russia will be broken off last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians are visiting Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who received monuments of the old Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses sought : fall of the beverage market in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack is practic@@ ed on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL on the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ker Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
among the fin@@ ite of a fire@@ arm required three dark @-@ dressed persons , which had prolifer@@ ate their faces , removed from the employees of the beverage market , the issu@@ ance of cash and whis@@ pered , then presumably with a silver coloured VW Golf .
how much money was taken , the police did not divide the police .
the perpet@@ rators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 metres , so relatively small .
the beverage market is accessible directly from the park deck of the Re@@ we market and is easily accessible .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert &apos;s path and from the gravel car park with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Sch@@ la@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
who at the crime time ( at 19.@@ 45 o &apos;clock ) observations made in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y should ur@@ gently report to the police .

the immigrants from the sea @-@ care unit Ey@@ oc@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to a four @-@ day Pil@@ gri@@ mage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages have been carried out .
to cross the time until the next Rom@@ am@@ wall@@ ets of all ministers in need to bridge over two years , the prime round of St. Anna decided to prepare and implement a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .

sh@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home when Br@@ ite wins for cycling !
Schot@@ t@@ lands Call@@ um Sk@@ inner &apos;s last night in the male team Sprint in the Vel@@ o@@ drome in Rio to fame as the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the role of his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y made herself to E@@ ly . the young and made the legend proudly , when he was stor@@ med to home a victory by the favor@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory over four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympi@@ ans medals .
it repeated the trick that she took place in March at the railway World Championships in London , despite the appearance of Ho@@ ys , a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as an execution .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap to close the Ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton .
Sk@@ inner was the man , with whom they stayed , when they saw potential in the gravel , which now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y victorious - and Sk@@ inner sat down into the qualification round , but in the ranks , the New Ze@@ al@@ ander victorious in the first lap .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his turn left almost immediately , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner kept it .
a strategy change made a large part of transformation , taking the Hin@@ des into a higher gear , to slow down it and to allow it to keep pace , and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell to Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they got on the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m only here to do my best and make me a name .
we have set up a Olympi@@ ad in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was just amazing .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the site Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys announced that he was inten@@ tionally inf@@ ring@@ ing the train after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no objec@@ ting of England &apos;s rival .
this time there was no problem with such a victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have joined the team in the last three months .
we came so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were obtained seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if that &apos;s a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days at the bicycle stream .
with the shape of knowledge it is in the realm of possible that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y who was born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) were also a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the might come from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which begins today and will start over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team Event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ on competition of the day , but there were some good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified for the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometer race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record that took place in London in 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final lap ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ gins with safety in focus .
he had fought yesterday with reference to the qualification , when function@@ aries were called to measure his body size .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , who will continue in the morning and will be retired , Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in the world war period in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team is reli@@ eved on his strong rail bike team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to take a lot of medals .
after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio went down .
it played Dra@@ mas in the background , so the resignation of technical lad@@ ers Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April am@@ id@@ st the midst of sex@@ ism and bul@@ b@@ ing@@ u as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , when you see the first evening of the competition in the bicycle stream , it looks quite later than the legendary reputation G@@ BS , which has reached the perfect moment its peak again .
future of melting of Portland due to raising the energy contract .
the future of aluminium car@@ mel@@ ts from Portland , Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - are on the stake , since the plant operator will announce the energy supply contract and to raise all delivery contracts , as the supply of energy companies are announced .
this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a maxim@@ inum payout set for 20 years is going on in November .
up to 2,000 jobs in the area of Al@@ coa in Portland .
not less than 2000 work@@ places -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk of closing .
in addition , it could come to Domin@@ o@@ deficiency , as the melting plant consumed around 10 per cent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa graduated from the Point of Henry , which led to an closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked an closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last@@ ly because of the current price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which serves the large aluminium sh@@ ov@@ y power plant with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Latin America , shared with that three more owners will announce their contracts .
the complex is located in the majority of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni cor@@ p are smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Portland continues to operate , which means a further physical demand for electricity by the melting file , &quot; divided the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to continue that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safety transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contracts were to have entered into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on revenues at AG@@ L from G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong trading markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L shared the value of contracts already written in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expec@@ tation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to book contracts entered the &quot; Sk@@ ir@@ i ... the melting file or the power supply to ensure that &quot; not affected . &quot;
the U.S. company said that it had completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which should have entered into force in 2010 , even if it is still a statement , why it came from the contract .
analysts war@@ n due to the bad economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland consume about 600 meg@@ awatts each year , and some 900 meg@@ awatts each year .
if both systems disappear from the market , it would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; .
and for us as a generator , this would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just one Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , it is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue
Antonio Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vo@@ gue .
San Antonio , brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the view of this Co@@ vers to weeping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Kendall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z On@@ k@@ els and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as they forgot the cover of her sister and finished with a classic turn : they have all planned a surprise part@@ y .
this represents the kl@@ ash of action with almost any birthday parties ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; you thought that we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to take part in this public@@ ity .
with regard to the September issue of Vo@@ gue , Vo@@ gue has started a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans .
Kend@@ alls great sister Kim likes them as concerned as the Vo@@ gue cover , ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that resem@@ bles more than a fashion magazine , the output indicates a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were 6@@ 15 pages of advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his co@@ ver@@ stars is so lon@@ ely expected that in the last two years pictures of the magazine will be le@@ ak@@ e@@ ased before the official announcement .
women who had already been on the cover cover Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ Prize winner and poet Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even at the low chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner , described by the journal , is described as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flow model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under the former category , it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous persons , or reality stars or you@@ ths of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything goes to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who are drawing up in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ant doesn &apos;t like any success .
with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ inger &apos;s position was always somewhat curious in the fashion world .
in June , the ein@@ sti@@ ge Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Stephanie Sey@@ m@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ised her called &quot; the mist@@ y of the moment . &quot;
these feelings cook again high , when the message came out with the show J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut , it seems to pass by the point .
Antonio Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the true sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
she makes advertising for your prim@@ ates of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell your pictures from themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her @-@ made images of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine .
and in their leisure time it is visible in reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal centres show 160@@ ,000 people every year
more than 16@@ 0.000 of the country &apos;s aux@@ ili@@ ary passages are rejected annually by the municipal centres , while the industry has already taken over further funding cuts on the effects of further intermediate cuts .
in Queensland three out of five people - mostly elderly people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for odd del@@ og@@ ations and those who have no means for free legal advice and legal counsel .
legal services in the community , which are already out@@ dated , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , these legal centres will lose a further 30 percent of their federal funds .
the director of the Municip@@ ality centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal centres revealed that thousands of people are exp@@ elled every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without the decision of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Queens@@ lands &apos;s Common Centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning thousands of people from important services you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ ob@@ struc@@ tible and impressive debts , families , who were dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers , which have been wrong - all these people have problems of right way and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
in June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent , meaning thousands of hel@@ per needy people from Queensland will be forced to return with their legal problems without any help .
we call for the general assembly and federal law as well as sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise these middle cuts promp@@ tly , so people can get the assistance they need to get in legal problems .
last year , the State government filled its commitment , funds for legal experts on the national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of municipal centres and its customer communities , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k is investing in this important work .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey on EU elections : SPD and CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) substantial losses for the government party SPD and CD@@ U .
this was the representative surveys of the opinion research institute in ins@@ a for the &quot; image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north might continue to rain in the north , it is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in both states , the SPD would have the strongest party and would have good chances to keep the head of head .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD collapsed of 3@@ 5.6 percent over five years ago .
according to the survey , the party was just scar@@ c@@ ely close to the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is fought between the left and AF@@ D .
the left would rise to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the AF@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day .
the Gre@@ ens are rising again despite a slight decrease with 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP are not represented by 3 percent in the country &apos;s day .
according to the Berlin Chamber of Represent@@ atives the SPD also showed only 23 percent of the survey ( election 2011 : 2@@ 8.3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 2@@ 3.4 per cent .
they were still standing behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the AF@@ D would represent 14 percent for the first time in the House of Represent@@ atives .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could really hope to return to the pirates in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and Internet in Tim@@ el@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the success@@ ors today domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturers experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and larger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ unk@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ abytes , which would be high resolution today for about two sel@@ fies .
a iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was just 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros lovers will buy the appliances even on the internet , but they come somehow to the Internet @-@ time of the Internet .
20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at C@@ eb@@ it &apos;s computer fair in Hanover as a &quot; office in the western counter format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to receive a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , even by fax it was communic@@ ator to achieve .
even the access to web pages was possible by HTML browser , if qu@@ icker slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the cell phone could be done like a laptop .
then found a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
quite proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 euros .
the average retail price of a smartphones in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody was able to show that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era in August 1996 .
since then everything has been different .
the smart phones are a success story , although not for Nokia .
the mobile version of the Finn@@ s experienced an un@@ parall@@ eled disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft .
today , there are providers that were all many years later than Nokia .
being online now , that is today for many people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
approximately 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone there are 5@@ 55 million pieces .
global sales with the equipment is approximately 400 billion euros .
to this end , the well @-@ running business of countless app providers and t@@ elec@@ oms have come .
a whole industry has since been developed around the smartphone .
the major breakthrough on mass market came only in early 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World to launch the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communications , to operate everything via touch screen .
the winner of Apple began , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group today .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the evidence .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
these are now Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
after its invention , the smartphone is 20 years after its invention .
on average , every German now has 88 times a day on his mobile phone .

England must expand the Olympic spirit and expand Heath@@ row
Heath@@ row is not only in our local municipalities and throughout London , but in whole country renewal and prosperity .
for me this was the biggest attraction of Heath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London , as we used a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be back , by creating new possibilities for local companies and companies nearby Heath@@ row .
for our local communities we are already 10,000 new teachers , create 40,000 new jobs and a youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead in London 2012 , we will admit that the challenge of the expansion of Heath@@ row is too large .
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and , that we will blu@@ ish on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wrong 2012 and they are also wrong with Heath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but Heath@@ row answers a question to him .
like the Olympic Games Heath@@ row is for many and not for single infrastructure project .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , to create £ 211 billion in a funny growth and a legacy of capabilities and jobs to be left at the airport as well .
we have a great team in Heath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion of expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , which was chosen for five years in a row as the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequency test drive in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
London &apos;s London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heath@@ row is also one of them .
it is time that we extend this olymp@@ ic mind and Heath@@ row as well as our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs to be proud of the England .

woman with suspected suicide on Swiss highway
the sacrifice was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses , after a woman was transferred to a motorway in the early hours on Thursday in a suspected hom@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred at the A1 in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman placed in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss woman is 49 years old , including a truck , including a truck , was going to kill himself .
she died still on site .
several drivers have already heard , but some are still not identified yet , the police , those , and any witnesses of the incident , were reported to report .
it was opened an investigation trial , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait , if one of the drivers is displayed .
was it inevitable ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosecutor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not pulled to the responsibility .
in each of the two cases - in which one person ran in the Dun@@ kl@@ en on the highway - was decided that the drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a pede@@ stri@@ ans run in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was in the newspaper .
last year a police officer was acquitted when she had killed and killed a man , who was in August 2014 one night at the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and is un@@ conscious of the road .
the court determined that the police officer -- who had answered an emergency call -- an justified manner , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday in the area of Morges should report at the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus had been inhab@@ itable
the Venus was most likely inhab@@ itable for the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms , which res@@ emble from climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have reported with its hot , water @-@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin , er@@ d@@ war@@ dly atmosphere , and still slowly turned off .
the model also lit the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet is thought to have more dry places than the Earth , but had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected against ev@@ ap@@ oration .
early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun which was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus declared their daily side of the sun for nearly two months , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io explained in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which seems like a umbrella to shiel@@ ding the surface of much of the sun heat .
the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than the earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus , which resem@@ bles the evolution , previously suspected of planetary research .
although they were presumably inhab@@ itable , Venus had been exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several thousand years .
their oceans are ev@@ apor@@ ated and their steam vap@@ our was burnt out of ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today .
the researchers distributed the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy coming back on Thursday as a trainer and vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and resulted in a low @-@ determination law in the decision process .
alternatively President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the club is immediately looking for a new coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as Chief trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and consistency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of summer , I thought a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needs and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey operations must be matched to the organisation .
he must also have a co @-@ determination in decisions which influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
Z@@ acc@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked thanks for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick was informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy &apos;s winner was awarded the best coach of the League during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 during his debut season .
he led the association on 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the late season in each of the last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell down behind the wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as a Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Canadi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ workers take talks again , put strike out strike
the workers must be suspended concerning the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea workers , while all parties sit for a new discussion round on the table , said negoti@@ ator .
strikes against the Wood Group field service provider Wood Group have been carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and the unions can confirm that we agreed to restart the winding process of the present day &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop some day @-@ day meetings in the coming weeks that will start the beginning of next year to re @-@ start the problems .
the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is to protest a protest against potential wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
Wood Group has reduced its rates for its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s advice follows a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company needs the necessary space to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has dismissed for its part of thousands of people and announced plans to raise its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as its business activities are ration@@ alized as a result of its meg@@ az@@ us@@ dol@@ ence with the UK energy company BG Group .
as a result of the lower crude oil prices , energy companies are under pressure , an economic situation , which caused by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament committee Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders in order to discuss one of the biggest work in the North Sea since a generation in North Sea .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Kepler &apos;s teles@@ cope has helped to collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the star cluster .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star cluster are rotating at different rates , as well as in which context of the time of rotation with the planet@@ arium disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that through the compar@@ ing of our results with other stars , read more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Pic@@ ca@@ des star cluster is 4@@ 45 light@@ years away from the earth .
many stars in this constellation , developed around 125 million years ago , reach now the adul@@ thood .
they are turning now fastest .
these mature stars encounter great amounts of star@@ ches .
since these winds travel through the stars , they have a slow effect to the stars .
when a star is al@@ igned , its rotation rate starts to slow down .
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a star@@ ring -- as sun lo@@ ung@@ ers -- see .
the latest catalog of rotary rates indicates that more massive stars are slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower sp@@ ears than smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ as@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors may tend to be mass@@ aging , while more rapid rot@@ ors are ten@@ ding to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
since the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar press in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
there is still a lot ahead of us . we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow@@ ing down their rotation rates , so to speak to their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ol and their colleagues have reported in detail on their latest analysis of the Ple@@ y@@ ades &apos;s latest analysis , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball @-@ Star occurs from
the tears ran at Alex Rodriguez faster than the U.S. bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional return announcement , the 41 year old professional will take place on 12 August against T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays to bear his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say &quot; Good@@ bye &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the 14 @-@ time all @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ participant of the major league bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times , Rodriguez became the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has been giving him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
by the end of the trial on 31 December 2017 , he will be acting as a consultant and youth coach .
as a player , it paid time for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for its teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he made the Yan@@ ke@@ es a few mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame @-@ Members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays only show two other bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old does not have to be taken into the glory of the bas@@ eb@@ alls .
because so successful Rodriguez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - in the field was so controversial is its appearance outside the square .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been banned from Ster@@ oids from 2001 to 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed down for 211 games due to an involvement in the so @-@ called bio@@ gene@@ esis sc@@ andal .
Rodriguez is considered as the main suspect , for years to have received long @-@ term anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a legal dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have done me for the year 2014 , because I did not break 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodriguez at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his farewell @-@ days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends have received the big stage once again , Rodriguez had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodriguez , who was married to the actress Cameron Di@@ az , and the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson , sympathy for fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee patri@@ rival Boston Red SO@@ X .
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; sang the followers at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team .

the first official d@@ oping of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in front of the seventh competition is announced .
the Chinese law in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre @-@ obstac@@ le in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positive and excluded - immediately before the start of the Athle@@ tics Championships , these messages come to the unknown .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de was used last Sunday , which is used as m@@ asked agent for d@@ oping tests .
the International Sports court , CA@@ S , confirmed on Friday afternoon in the Olympics for the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly , only at 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en would have to participate in the bre@@ ads of more than 50 m Freestyle .
Ch@@ en has applied the opening of the B sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the National Association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en full cooperation with the examinations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will be working with the International Sports court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio sick@@ ly the news about the positive sample near Dan@@ ek@@ owa through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation might be food supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to act in the banned substance to act blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ ents EP@@ O .
after B@@ NT , Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B sample should already be positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow promp@@ ted promp@@ tly to critic@@ ise the criticism of the Ath@@ os .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men do not draw the right shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We have no chance under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , for instance , all the wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter may not participate in the chron@@ ically de@@ op@@ ing@@ ed nation in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known as the London Olympic champion in class to 85 kg and was tested positive for three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both deny taking , however , both may not start in class up to 94 kg .
prior to the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa &apos;s case is another serious blow for the reputation of the entire sport .
the IA@@ AF world association had the complete Russian team up to one exception because of systematic d@@ oping d@@ oping the start , the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya has produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition , the previous shifts in China had also fed into force in China for heavy disp@@ utes between athletes .

dat@@ ashe@@ et : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ press h@@ ack@@ ers her solv@@ ent
programm@@ ers of black@@ mail malware currently interv@@ ene targeted enterprises - and are successful again .
according to a recent survey of the malware abor@@ tion , mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies were at least once , some of the victims of a attack with black@@ mailing software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of the companies had already been aiming at a Ran@@ som@@ ware Er@@ press@@ way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 40 per cent of the victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ adily available from the required solution , to be able to use the challenged systems and data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rators Speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes in case of attacks in company networks .
if they succeed there , the potentially rede@@ em sol@@ ub@@ ine is considerably higher than in private use .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 most painting programs were still designed to send ads .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only they were the aim , but the change to company att@@ ain happened in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware operates after a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it is searching for un@@ long @-@ changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustainable .
afterwards the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
in order to obtain the final turn@@ table code , the victims must show money - usually in the form of cryp@@ ting bit@@ coin .
but where with private use the personal photo database is on the game , it goes to companies for sensitive customer data or project databases , without producing the production .
accordingly higher the damage is affected , if a Ran@@ som@@ or strikes .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to inter@@ rupt the business activities in one case , people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several times of hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by loss of ambul@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say the victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do not pay , you only promotes the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , their data will get back .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpet@@ rators .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the R @-@ Secure &apos;s security researchers investigated the user interfaces and the contact with the black@@ mail and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer care to increase more money .
they declare their victims per chat , as they can pay per bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites , or de@@ cryp@@ t for free example files .
and private people will be delivered to payments of a few hundred Euros , businesses have to pay hard @-@ negoti@@ ate and pay five @-@ digit sum@@ s in order to reg@@ ain their data .
in view of potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware Er@@ press@@ way the h@@ ack@@ ers become increasingly professional and share the work , explains security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the SO@@ PH@@ OS Antivirus provider : &quot; a single person can write a Ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
more likely , however , is that it is three or four people .
the programm@@ ers sell their pollut@@ ants software then in the form of a software structure to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware kits were created by the malware self , consulting and additional tools for one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included is a adap@@ tive tool , so that smaller configuration , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ mailing are then looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the fresh @-@ purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so you log into one of the forums in the underground , buys the set of a criminal and commissioned to install the software on as many PCs .
payment is made per inf@@ alli@@ zed machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminal investig@@ ators apply sp@@ amm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known for many companies that improve their data .
over 50 percent of the companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey put confidence in Ran@@ som@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are pursuing new strategies already .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone has no sufficient threat to successful detection , the perpet@@ rators instead with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
as a result , the potential for damage is much higher than before , depending on the type of data .
in future , the perpet@@ rators could also deliver new goals in the internet of things on the grain .
at the Hack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con demonstrated security researchers , as they were able to get a connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter , the heating of a der@@ art could certainly be worthy of such a rans@@ om .
if the perpet@@ rators , instead of blocking the heating in the future , block the whole factory road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a subject in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases .

disease case : when paid by the organizer
after their journey , holi@@ day@@ makers get back after their journey when the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ ful in the hotel .
this is only the case if more than ten per cent of guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the tried case , a family was heavily polluted by diar@@ rhoea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish ur@@ gency .
they spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought the holi@@ day@@ makers back to a defective scale , which allegedly contam@@ inated the sea water .
the family was the view , the journey was lacking , and compl@@ ained against the promot@@ er .
before the court the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
true , the situation was indeed defective .
but the organizer was just before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to go out until then , that the sea water was fine .
he thus did not viol@@ ate his information , so the judgment .
since in the samples of water no imp@@ urities were found .

de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people would have worried about further attacks .
the State must be occupied and decided to react to terror at the same time .
certainly , our country will not answer the violence of perpet@@ rators with hatred and cle@@ av@@ age .
we will not indul@@ ge this triumph .
if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country , then increase the security and force the approval of the population for the refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of proposals until the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another person@@ alised gain of security forces , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over medium @-@ digit size order over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympath@@ ies for terrorism must be under punishment .
video surveillance should be improved , the arms should be improved so after especially the purchase of weapons on the Internet .
the last many discussed wel@@ ds for doctors should stay away after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
however , he wants to search for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , as the threat of citizens can be dimin@@ ished , he said with a look at psych@@ ic views .
in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds a better social care for this .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
for the persecution of criminals in special areas of the Intern@@ ets ( Dark@@ net ) de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD Chef Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which contributes to further improve safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior said clearly against shareholder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a ear@@ spro@@ cket for the hing@@ es in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fun@@ ke Medi@@ group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

better traffic flow on the motorway
it st@@ ems regularly on the road - here a picture of November .
but that should change : the law firm should be extended .
this is a good news for all car rac@@ ists who stand in traffic on the surrounding road every evening when they drive across the Motor@@ way ( A 43 ) .
road construction operates on upcoming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 . / 17 . August ) between the Hammer Road and the main road Wes@@ eler Straße is about 700 meters .
drivers can then thread the right from the Hammer Straße directly .
the big advantage : the traffic is shared early , whereby the overall process will improve on the varied section of the Bundes@@ strasse 51 ( Bundes@@ strasse 51 ) .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road@@ store on the Zu@@ br@@ inger is the car &apos;s mot@@ orists especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
the no@@ ble@@ ak dates back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her Path , and sometimes even beyond .
the N@@ adel@@ ö@@ hr on B 51 is just before the main road Wes@@ eler Street .
from here , traffic only shows the bridge across the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built in three years ago .
the reason : static calculations put that the bridge has no longer the required load capacity to absorb the heavy traffic .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck , which is linked to the connected gro@@ au , it cannot be said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , we have to count with years : for the bridge has an official remainder of the year 20@@ 34 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the extension of the legal gu@@ ardian of the country , the country has been deliberately chosen to pay the more traffic time in the school holidays because with disabilities .
traffic will be on the road on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
inter@@ cultural travel : cultural activities for schools

rain instead of shooting stars : hope on weather repair
the weather has made the shooting stars in the southwest of Germany in the night to fri@@ day a traffic through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was so suitable for clouds and rain to observe the sky spectacle , the president of the observ@@ atory , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we will see many shooting stars in the sky .
there are per@@ sei@@ zes , which belong to the quick@@ est shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their names , because they apparently come from the Per@@ seus constellation , which is in the northeast .
relaxing night : tips for insom@@ nia
in the evening , there is etern@@ ally walking around , at night you are awake and wake up , in the morning there is no longer thinking about sleep .
this is all other than relaxing .
after all , one has problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults sleeping and more than ten percent find their sleep frequent or permanent as a non @-@ relaxing .
how can sleep problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and they can be destroyed with various causes , Hans @-@ Günter We@@ aver , board member of the German Society for Sch@@ la@@ ff@@ ing and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what one understands , however , is the in@@ som@@ nie , i.e. one entry and the sleeping disorder .
just having gone through to sleep many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht says , board member at the German home@@ work association with practice in the Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces are complex .
these are organic , psychological or behavi@@ oral factors behind it , but also medications are stuck .
not rare is the sleep disorder expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early wake up is often common with depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it may be that various factors need each other .
for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be bad , w@@ aking up every two to three hours and starts bl@@ ur@@ red on everyday problems and worry , there is no example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I sleep with sleep problems ?
those who do not sleep well over a month in at least three nights a week , and is affected by day , should go to the doctor .
the imp@@ air@@ ment may look different : one is beaten , tired , tired , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ aches .
to ease the sleep disorder , it is important to find their causes .
as an treatment options , behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cog@@ nitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even drugs - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional case and at most for two weeks - in@@ qu@@ ire .
headquartered in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ xed , Head of Inter@@ disciplinary Research Centre at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , Germany .
therefore , one should take care of sleep problems first at the inf@@ ar@@ st , advis@@ es white .
this can clari@@ fy with examinations , whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go into sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for example , in the sleep laboratory , medical examination , for example , in snor@@ ing with respiratory suffer@@ ers , at diseases of sleep or when you can &apos;t find the cause of a sleep disorder , explains fi@@ xation .
you do not have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ xed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after blin@@ king you go to bed at his normal time .
besides the electro@@ des on the body you have a nose g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a antenn@@ as on the finger .
in addition , a camera paints a camera on the ceiling .
how can I get the problems in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of screws , on which one can get for better sleep .
We@@ aver counts on : regular sleep and up@@ set , not too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep to sleep , don &apos;t sleep to sleep , alcohol , and at night do not begin to look at the clock - then you begin to reck@@ on immediately , and that is absolutely not promoting .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself by Facebook for dis@@ appo@@ inting cutting of the DS@@ V teams at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he collected gold for the first time in Doha , and at the same time he set up his first record record .
now the former DS@@ V athl@@ ete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has put his ad@@ joining the ex @-@ team @-@ mate to his criticism before his criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € premium and a jungle dec@@ ay 150.000 € , no one should be surprised about missing medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the don@@ or system in the water sports is bad , the d@@ oping controls are very good .
we can not compete with countries who promote very much and do not work with the subject D@@ oping , or even do it even .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to launch a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler has to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if not a certain period before WM / OS of independent controllers , WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A can &apos;t take part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hamburger Hamburger who now runs an ice@@ berg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : bonds of luggage arrested
professional sealing at the airport Düsseldorf
civil f@@ ahn@@ ges of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer Police escaped the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years .
the Tat@@ ars have committed several hand@@ bags and bag steels as bonds .
at 21.@@ 30 , civil servants accepted a gang in the airport of Düsseldorf airport , which was known as polic@@ emen from past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several Del@@ ic@@ te during mid @-@ July of this year and were collabor@@ ative , working , and especially professional .
the specialists in the crime principle 34 can as@@ sign the di@@ stra@@ cts that were specifically tailored to the off@@ ences of off@@ ences to Germany .
in doing so , they caught up over 15.000 Euro .
old buildings , a couple of trees , in between still a rest of the cob@@ ble@@ stones in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in looks at the first sight not so , but the police counts them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
walk along the east side to the west , one comes along the courts , a refresh@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the facade of a grey place someone has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite to a Li@@ dl which will soon be demol@@ ished , it will be built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments are to be created here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls in the last weeks , however , is preferred by burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents drew rental agreements , but on the ground floor are more space occupied and are used for events .
at the beginning of the year , the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator handle had repeatedly called for a tough advance of the police against the project , the area called &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for police officers and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ sch@@ mie@@ de , had been cleared with 300 police officers , pat@@ ched the police for three weeks with official statements by 30 to 40 officials and three team van on the spot , locked parts of the road , and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown house@@ keeper the rooms .
on July 13 , a Berlin district court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and one day later , police and builders moved under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the road looks peaceful : parents go with children , sitting at the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are enter@@ tain late late .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there are a primary school and kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many citizens : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who is here three children , are mainly driven by the police presence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the residents of the hood , they share the care of rising r@@ ents and g@@ un@@ electri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound after a &quot; Kie@@ z , &quot; who wanted to un@@ wanted majority of police protection from v@@ and@@ als on the left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator and the police make up between houses and their neighbours , obviously does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in East Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which also today compared to the rest of the city a lower average income and high risk of poverty .
also houses and the resulting living projects belong to the &quot; Kie@@ z : &quot; in 1990 , numerous houses have been occupied by the former East Germany , including almost the entire mainstre@@ am street near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been cleared out of a regular police station , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are partly inhabited by people today , who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly become mag@@ nets for tourists and elec@@ ting lin@@ ers from all over the world , with them now local people from GDR times and former home @-@ her@@ etics rested their &quot; Kie@@ z . &quot;
this is also noticeable with the r@@ ents that have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them on the designed discs or freshly kn@@ itted fac@@ ades which were cast in color .
no other street was mentioned this year so often with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
one reason for this , that not all neighbours therefore may be considered a problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes like body inj@@ uri@@ fying statistics thus almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of off@@ ences make real damage , which tend to meet new buildings and fresh renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house for 17 years next to the controversial 94 years , uncertainty can be no speech .
as for violence , they complain about : people in 94 are their neighbours who have not been determined .
the famous burning cars also give it right in the Rig@@ a@@ er no longer .
for studying architect , her street is not a criminal law , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more apart from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously dra@@ gged into the Rig@@ a@@ er street - and stayed .
therefore it was also so important that the residents get back their streets : from the police , politics and the media , all of which suddenly stressed the interpretation of the area in July .
but in the eyes of residents as Neu@@ geb@@ auer the road will continue to be taken away : in a secured new building in former buildings which the old residents are pushing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are all sorts of con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many , - here are people who are not so well drunk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not have gu@@ ide@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if one never stops someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding of research , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the building projects and the left scene belonged to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who are moving , should be aware of it - just as someone who moves into a pubs who can complain badly about noise .
all persons with the first names are asked , not to be called by their real name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee service
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in terms of integration and organizer .
in addition , she is social worker .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee service for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social ped@@ agog@@ es support the team of administration for Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it appears as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugees , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine customer from the working group indicates that Deu@@ t &apos;s hon@@ our@@ able is more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , who have been experiencing wool mil@@ chs@@ au , which has primarily a problem .
so some - less mo@@ cking more than rather on the multitude of desired up@@ sets - meant - as the administration wanted to write the job .
we are looking for administration with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long experience in the field of social work , just an aff@@ ens@@ ative wool mil@@ ks@@ y .
but the administration is not their central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says .
above all , it is about organisation , work with people on the spot , and behind the scenes and network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been around for six weeks .
she has completed a 50 @-@ percent spot on three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports hon@@ esty and full official stakeholders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
the new container in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße are soon available .
there has been a grave problem since some time , apartments for connecting flights which have been recognised .
commun@@ es are responsible for the connection of the connection .
you need to accommodate refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations have to carry the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Regional Office of the Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every land@@ lord wants to offer its apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto , the administration doesn &apos;t find private apartments .
so far , it does not work until you have to rely on private dwell@@ ings , Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , general apartments must be in@@ timi@@ dated as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are placed in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed lead , there are intern@@ ships , training courses , courses , one @-@ euro jobs and hel@@ pless activities for refugees and migrants who have to become p@@ ung@@ ed or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house @-@ master , do non @-@ profit work - and the motivated and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external action .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but it does not work only work .
the day needs a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer .
people would have to develop a prescription .
so there are offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
thus , management and am@@ bition are also allowed .
it was central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you need to explain the refugees that it will take time to make it possible , for example , with language courses .
those who sometime make the feeling that he could not help in Ur@@ bach wouldn &apos;t work and be un@@ profitable , who will never be able to integrate .
the clear majority is motivated .
there are also problems , but also says customer honest , &quot; People who doesn &apos;t go at all . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and client is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : do the two are afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some people may call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a resi@@ dual risk could and would not exclu@@ de them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these inci@@ dents are also the subject of refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ in would complete them completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so , main and hon@@ our@@ able must take place in the region and in the region after activities .
they always have in the background that soon a new push for refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
do Germany need a limit ?
this is clear to answer , they are afraid of politics .
actually , it is un@@ fair to place them hel@@ pers on @-@ site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived there where we would like , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher already fast@@ ed that people are reasonable to integrate the previous people .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but if people are in need , one should help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no easy answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar with helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew around one hour away several areas - un@@ successfully .
two unknown men are violent on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 p.m. in an apartment in a multi @-@ family home in the Lin@@ den@@ weg path .
the locals surprised the two and struck the Un@@ hol@@ ocaust in the fle@@ eing .
