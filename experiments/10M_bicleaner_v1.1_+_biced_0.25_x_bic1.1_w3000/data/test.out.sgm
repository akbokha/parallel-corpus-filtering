<seg id="1">Clinton and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP - they want both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">The two US presidential competitors are, however, at the tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton lies a fundamental, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to bestow the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be quite different, claims Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will return regulators massive, and he is strong for a vast tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has to fulfill certain tasks, he has advantaged chances to open and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes were raised for the rich, says she.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost what is equal.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are rejected by the state-based teapy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So, on Trump, no internal discussions could be given.</seg>
<seg id="17">Clearer are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to grow coal-fired power plants and drive up coal plants in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas to terminate the Paris climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "Clinton wants to extend and strengthen renewable energies with its investment programme:" "" "a country will create the superpower of the clean energies and create millions jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - also with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the capacidic trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the US would not want to regulate the international trade, but simply to protect the US jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should also be paid even better, Clinton tells about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to be, then he says he will not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the major discussion of the coming months should be likely to develop the tax policy of the two bearings.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump, who wants to unload the economy and the citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold him ahead, that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton stands at least from the rich who wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more control are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every one-fledged woman has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who are wandering alone, almost everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen, four women sit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby that is maximum one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son into his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curious in the room with big eyes.</seg>

<seg id="12">The scene is normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social shipments in Bavaria, and deals with the topic women on the escape.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are winged.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentralized accommodation for alluged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs made the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's War.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - even as visitors.</seg>

<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has made experience with sexual violence," "" "said Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted because they are guilty of torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hope of hope," she tells.</seg>
<seg id="24">In women, there are many reasons for the escape: "many steal away secretly, because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honor, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is driving them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run, this goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "for example, tugboats demand an sexual action for a bottle of water, is not a rarity," "" "said Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Those who believe that once they would come to Germany, you are mistaken.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and even abruptly abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is that about 90 percent of women living in the Munich's north, traumatized, estimates them.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not volunteered."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women have so used to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "or she doesn't dare to speak openly about the living, because the shame is too big." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they are often not willing to help, there is more accommodations for them, calling for Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question whether they wasted from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answer some with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">There is no such thing in the governments of the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Swabia alone, women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press briefer of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In some parts of the halls, lower and middle franken houses, there are only individual women and their children only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "the committee" "" "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" "" "also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men." ""</seg>

<seg id="46">Above all, the shower room should be easily accessible and accessible to women, stands in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">How much women feel this protection need, one can read on the Andre that there is at the house in Munich.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of external side"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture which ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up his hands and proclaim a official end of the eight month war in the war and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterplayer in the gold-gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I cannot spoil myself from intrucks that Ankara wants to be reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the thread, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smiles appeared shy and hardly radiate warmth, even for its recasting circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the contrary, repeats his" "" "dear friend" "" "- according to a report all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even be improving.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved like that, would never happen any worst.</seg>
<seg id="11">Seemingly, his enthusiasm seemed rather to signify the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable kitchen showed that the state of state of Russia had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his execution: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was wutentlessly.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin divided and accused Ankara to have Russia back into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The failure was even bigger, since it was committed by a personal friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The showcases back up again will be difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state-controlled media conducted a violent, non-restricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed, the Turks would carry anything to blame.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "the allegations of leaders in Syria have benefited that Erdoğan had benefited from illegal oil dealers in Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only therefore because Putin received the excuse for President Erdoğan's President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clearly on hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan takes all the friends who can get after last month after a failed coup d'etat.</seg>
<seg id="28">The terrorist attack on Turkey has also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motifs.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal hidean in the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the television footprint is projected fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish farm imports are allowed to be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "tourists stayed there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara furiously angered Ankara on the West, since its reaction to the attempted power of power was considered a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To achieve this, the profoundly groll of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike is to move out of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, Russian state leader won a bonus for a bonus that he called for a coup d "état of the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is good for Moscow notices a self-understandable, that even a deep-sitting fear of regimes has changed.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious Palace in the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one how it once described me an analyst, "Alliance of external side": two countries that violate from the West and get badly dealt with and now unite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but to support Russia and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be indicative that after almost three hours of preliminary talks, both presidents affirmed the press conference, that they had not even been striped out of the theme.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey rents out to respond to a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphasize these.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about where a common Nenner can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect Disaster, when NATO member states attacked the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders talk at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="5">In an opinion of the Kremlin, Putin is that Putin is arranged without indication of "the dismissal Ivanovs of his duties as Chairman of the Russian President of the Presidential Administration."</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who founded Ivanovs since 2012, has been appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned state of Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin website (in Russian) it means that he was later head of the head of the head of the head of the head office.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin:" "" "thank you for your trust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of state and inspections to implement your instructions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysteriously.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time one of the closest colleagues Vladimir Putin and works as he was for Soviet intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff returns to his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, is there the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at present.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president once was to lead to Russian environmental policy - came to great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, which are cited on the site of the Kremlin, Ivanov said, "It's true that I asked you to do this very complicated item in early 2012 - one could almost say - to be confidential for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and the former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), was appointed KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin made power to power he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third office of Putin could violate the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, approaching ally Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister, before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="7">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>

<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the expiration between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, almost 79% of the entire bridge of bridge at their place and the last section of the decks are given today in Rosyth a betonguss for the deck, which means the whole deck is ready to be lifted to its square.</seg>

<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the bridge over 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very delicate job at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "hand concept living" for the next installment.</seg>
<seg id="5">But arguments is programmed.</seg>

<seg id="7">A regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "Christoph Bratmann said:" "" "we agree with the Green Party:" "" "we agree with the Green Party: who wants to build on urban areas must prove 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors on such a land at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social apartments." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban residential construction programme, which will cost millions, and will still be financed, shall provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, so Bratmann: "there are still no agreement between the fractions."</seg>

<seg id="16">Regardless of its, so Bratmann, topped up the situation of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">The action concept is implemented, will ensure additional tasks in the construction administration.</seg>

<seg id="21">But how do you compare the loss of further about 1300 cheap apartments, whose promotion will run out in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, the designer of Nicole Palm, S & D spokesperson on planning, should now be purchased out of the city.</seg>

<seg id="29">Only: we don't want the owners, the housing companies not.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social apartments in the West city is drastically increased, they are removed from the target of so-called mixing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teens and child don't go out outside, but rather it would prefer to spend their free time to spend on screens, has been complained of many years in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, people get to pick up people from the sofa and get more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time at the screen was initially limited to TV, then on video games and lastly on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I am looking forward to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that was created first for the video games in the 1990s (later it created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture fell slightly ahead of the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was shifted by the massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go will have more users as Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players are looking for outside and looking for Pokémons that are followed with a GPS and once they were found once found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "taken captive."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in increments that the "average" person returns each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the market launch of the game, the number of people followed by 45 per cent to 53 percent each day.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw details for increasing performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to bring about "themselves 30 minutes" to come from the sofa, "and" every day to be active, "launched on deaf ears, because many public messages are bored to health and come from people who look like this.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who regularly drives sports, reduces his chances of getting cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages, which is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful Pokémon go is that there is people to do something in the open, making them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are three pillars of health cover - movement, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close hunting even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">Anyway, there are more serious hisations, which must always be harder to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough has happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit earlier couldn't follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">New will lose its appeal and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activites in the real world, and so many people can help hunting, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast ended on Thursday for multiuse title and extended the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the headlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall score of 62,198 was clearly in front of the silver medalists and "Final Five" Team kameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian Bronzemedailleningin Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Americans Simone Billet turnt in the Swedish Baltic Sea, during the single campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-stage title and a total of the fifth, while they consolidate their reputation, to be the best of their generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke out in tears, when her final result was shown and her long journey took place at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">She puts it in the same league as a unique athlete like Michael Phelps, which brought her sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">In the past three years, Bilbao dominates her sports art - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton told her that she is "the best gymnast that I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It was waiting for a final examination in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athlete, but rather between it and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not having a handful gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Americans Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman reverts after having won gold and silver in single multi-fight for women at the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Billet took the first medal on Tuesday while she retired on the farewell party coordinator Martha Karolyi as an exclamation mark.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although it insisted, during their long journey to the top, never the future is planned, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical tumbling passport - is matched to Latin American music, at home from the road outside of the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child, and by trainer Aimee Boormans mother, during a school trip into the gym hall, was discovered in Boorman, became the force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013 she has no longer lost a campaign competition, a winning party that will continue as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina was light caused by two torments, the image collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Schwebebales and Bodenturns - in which Bales holds the world championship title - lurned.</seg>
<seg id="28">She repeated again with 15.433 on the pig sea again - and with a 15,933 on the ground still another one.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman hugged them gently as they expected their final - a pure form of formality - and tears gleamed up in shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision that they once described in their collective book, became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake in Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time the 22 year old team captain, called "Oma," had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After their soil, she threw the audience of Kusshes, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I present in the Turning's Olympic champion and for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">Firstly I've been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three handnerders, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren, Laurie "Hernandez, who inspirational for many young girls other complexion.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin is and Madison Koencian, the Catholics, round off, makes every proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has strengthened the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the past four years the number one was one Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That is what strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was celebrated a surprising Olympics in America and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they expected unexpected, but masterful Gymasks routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone the fourth, heterosexual Americans who won gold in an individual multi-stage event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the top of these sports, but so do not look like gyms in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympic champion will have only four women in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainers.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like that Turns is a expensive sport and Turner's first line in private gyms that are maintained by parents, who come up for training, setup, travel and hotel costs (for the coach and their Turner and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gyms are in wealthy suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these associations, the Turner will receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long lasting commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes, since they started working with the turbo.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired by the municipalities of Aun innumerable young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gyms of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events we have free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15.000 urban young people (especially black and hispanic) and trains national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth of high quality gymnastics that make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health and professional and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnassionism and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is so exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympic team golds and thank you who motivated her so many young girls with different background to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets Election of London in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special court ruled that the reigning Council of Luton Rahman should be revealed on corrupts and illegal practices of his Amtes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright fails to guide his tongue to the dirty places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underlined his immune system and worms in a serious test - by pushing some of the dirtiest and most precious places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk cut off his position on a Euro-hill, a railing on the Piccadilly Circus, a rinse pot of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to provide the resistance of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of each object, he used a luminometer to show oneself, and to show us what he is going to get.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results in daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, the dishwaher of a train toilet emptted, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive but in fact, there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen spinning.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright said with doctors and medical specialists on promoting intestinal bacteria and its own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left behind him, nothing more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Wright was well known to test the resistance of its intestines by passing through the world, as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations up to dishwashers of toilets, the task assigned to its immune system under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "already as a child I was relatively unworried about what my health concern and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludge."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was definitely righteous in his call.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its denture showed a luminance of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared with this, the Luminometric level is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to leak after their luminance count exceeds 4000 units, while freshly washed hands are less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and the Finnish producers of dairy products Valio produced the travel route "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film he says, "That's the worst thing I've got in a toilet, close."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing less dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm going to leak nothing here, because it is natural here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio braids, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating for watching and at the same time explains the benefits of Probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We brought crazy Brainstormings, which ended so we told "Let's call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with the documentary we were able to provide more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the direction of the film, added: "let me say that I have lost my respect for Ian if he had to have some of the things I needed to leak, like the disgusting Russian toilet which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian, to leak them and others, with which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we have recorded some of these dirty treats in film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio conducted by 2015, 84 percent of those surveyed had lactic acid bacteria particularly with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they have at least occasionally used products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="28">That was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extremely difficult and their deeds had to look terrible for their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the church, who have passed courageous on us and have provided us the information we have done.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsky Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals have nothing from the summer campaign to choose - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">Until 2021, the country code will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the setter parliament decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">As far as so far it does not go: summer holidays, heat and land battle - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals that are to be convinced by the fighters are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most holidaymakers who are on the country are on Usedom, Rügen, or Hiddensee, are not the locals who are not allowed to choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: in the holidays, helpers, posters inflames, flyers, flyers, and the end of the votes will be accumulated, only mühevoll.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last Feria day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass its electoral struggle for just under the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot stage, when you can tell it all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clear behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting, how strongly newcoming AFD cut off and what remains left at the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years of age, and since 2008 head of head, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributes roses and chatted a little with the people, just as it did the legendary saying Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, sailors have cold feet and Chancellor Merkel gives the blame for the bloom of the AFD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her refugee policy, her "We create" I accelerates the rise of the right populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you are doing the right place for the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has also invited Angela Merkel to major reports; the German Chancellor Angela Merkel lies in the Northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburger and Western Pomerania.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "says Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad to emanate from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise the Northeast CDU renounces the usual electrophies on market locations and shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">That, so coking, plays only a "subordinated role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noticed that on the country it takes away the base that she needs to be very strict, again to find a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are talking about the Left, the SPD, the Green Party: in the country's whales are hardly available.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "the Council of the CDU ballers coats to his cohites, though," "" "You must go there where it hurts, namely, where people are: Dorffeste, golden weddings, any birthday party must be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because there is a lot in the game, Sellering has called for a particularly dedicated election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, S & D Group recorded a 22 percent partner behind the CDU (25) and just under AFD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2011, the SPD won still clearly win with 35.6 percent prior to the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The green, small party with seven percent in the polls, is likely to make the leap in the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue from holiday-need and lay down their election campaign into the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "online election campaign," "" "is called Claudia Mueller's President." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Apart from that, green campaign calls on spurcensor after native stimulation among the holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gaek, the top candidate, kurvt just with a houseboat by the mecklenian lakes and also finds it beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "election holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no punishment."</seg>

<seg id="8">The Entente is also praised for the construction work, such as the establishment of heating trips.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site is waved to the South on Monday and also the lock of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and thereby the connection to Rottenburg, the traffic situation has relaxed within the place.</seg>

<seg id="1">The terrorist control of laws is constantly being screwed in the name of the terrorist control.</seg>
<seg id="2">After the recent proposals, Interior Minister de Maizière takes place a thick safety package.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what has a dulling status to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all of this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="6">All his proposals are politically acceptable, "says the Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs in the presentation of his new security committee.</seg>
<seg id="7">They don't demand anybody.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other, further points would be discussed initially within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">I took part in this too.</seg>
<seg id="10">But as the Minister of the Interior, he was located on results and at a "recoverable consensus" within the Coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">De Maizière takes a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, before he presents his conclusions to the Security in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But these are all more extensive, however.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some is already known, announced, announced that a new security authority to take care of the crack of encrypted communication is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">Not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU regulations on air passenger data and weapons.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies are also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de Maizière will start a second start for proposals that have not yet to do with the SPD: he wants to knock sympathies for terror groups under punishment and jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "that will be difficult for the SPD," "" "dreaming the CDU-man." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "he still stop this for reasonable and demanding nothing, which had no chance in the coalition partner." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas presented de Maizière too.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is partially in itself: he is planning to launch a quick procedure for deportation and more possibilities for the detention of people prior to deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted targeted in the country should check their smartphones and open social media accounts for security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">For distrative asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse offenders than so far - such as those who go offences or willingly discarded their papers in order to send their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">A lot of it is political and legally.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some also still seems unbalanced and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the imbalance of Gedser, for instance, the question arises: what does it actually have to do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, say de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be mentioned in tongues, that the assassin of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people worried about the high refugee pay for security.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that are deeply engaged in people do not let go out in election times.</seg>
<seg id="30">The internal security is enormously high in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nizza.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The security is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are electoral fights.</seg>
<seg id="35">Union and SPD are therefore increasingly bringing home security on the subject of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the last days it went up between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a garnished dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then on a security policy officer of some Unions of the Unions, in which the Ressortchefs also claim a Burka ban and a return of double citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also fugitive to conciliatory sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">From a turn from the double-pass he won't stop anything.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have fixed the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">You reinstate, be not wise.</seg>
<seg id="42">And on a Burka-prohibition he had unconstitutional concerns.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether his own package is constituent at all corners and whether it is actually "acceptable" to the coalition partner, only must show itself.</seg>
<seg id="44">There is some in it, what could happen to battle.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD, too, is currently attempting to benefited at the subject of internal security.</seg>

<seg id="32">In the wide term "guarantee," Volkswagen will see the opportunity for example a half year after rearmament around with an engine damage to a workshop - and that might result in the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who is buying records actually?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle ages love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before joining the commentator, to overseduce it under the pseudonym non-Allebald-old men with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the visionary production of records is not based on a boom in millennials, who like to greet the news of physical objects, but due to mid-life nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most probable buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes through Hobbysammers - it has an emotional meaning: older flat buyers keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs 53%) and enjoy it alone to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But does the results of YouGov vote?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on television, I would run the camera during a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit, and digging wildly before I stand, my hands hold and something more determinedly as: "so let us take a close look upon it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let us take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart beats SoHos slowly from its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent seller has been based - there are still a handful of fantastic record shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I left by Sister Ray (figures: two young women, three men middle ages) into the Reckless Records (figures: eight men middle ages, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill up the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4.000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed home), changing the walls of his sitting room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available entry: it is now able to buy records, which he could not afford to buy records, which he was sold, when he was young and plea.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees to those who buy records, rather introverted and happily spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my aster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets to apply for the Yougov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medienhy, people who have heard about the comeback and get to buy their old records back again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the discussions that I have led, people usually have drafted their collection so around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy back their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of the record player of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of panels?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like phonica to recognise that record shops offers a soothing community of parables.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older client assumptions contact the contactless payments system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to draw back to the stability of trusted records, of objects, happy jigots.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or ownership of material possessions than a kind of comfort," Wez says.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collectors so and I think it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "there are a workforce from a platform stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people bought a record last month they haven't heard it yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a turntables that they never use while 7% of those who buy a record, do not have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point of the news report I would probably look very worried while I lost a stack to Bossa Nova Kompiles.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (data count: three men of middle ages) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here recently, and said," I have no record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead Schallplatte so that I can make it into the shelf. "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it is definitely going.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musicians.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, which slowly come to clean.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fender, dedicated to the record almost an entire floor, has a blower audience when I am purge.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teens and women aged middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts the latest synthesizers and sextet pop instead of experimental jazz wears from the speakers - it is good to see such diversität in the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but brand psychic traumas are hard to detectable if you stand next to somebody for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs around for a few minutes in business and consider the Variety of the plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a mannequin as a large shopping basket.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, therefore, collecting boards are no real option, it says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or any way, but the beauty of platens is... "it drives with a loved sighs.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I'm giving the note, the jeans-Hotpants, I watched a group of young teens that group themselves for a moment by Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think to buy a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential boards for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some as far as far as it is impossible to express them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record-art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry, and some customers could send to the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as boards.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research tests revealed that the results of Yougov vote, they leave, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record-loving girls who exist in reality, record shops and in Onlineforen exist.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the bumblebees through record shops on Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while staring the staring views of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator, who rises nothing of the shoulders of middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisionally shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, who live in thousands of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="3">In a court hearing this week, the authorities were arguing that the state should be able to dismantle 72 provisional businesses in which persons within the camp's goods, selling cigarettes to energy drinks, sell barber services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-er Rugby came to the final on Thursday evening at a rupting stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 in Deodoro Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Fiji, a masterclass presented in the handling, side stepping, reproduction, liner and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic Medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was swept through the non-bad consolation prize of silver medals - UK fourth on that day - and they could certainly be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of Boks, 7-5 in semi-final on the same day could fall on them in the finals.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in this form, in this form, in this form a 15-man team would have been defeated.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be for GB a consolation - but it probably won't be that at least a Brite will hang on a gold medal for his neck: Fijis boss Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult way behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost every game in Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap will hurt, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Fiji the attacks started and started the attacks of GBS.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and co. next, one would run into moving buses. the World Series winner went out 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau went down in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minute playtime Jerry Tuwai added another assault from the right corner that he shifted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB have hardly got the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hicraped Tackle Drop just stops the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third gate but it has not stopped in Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua caught a touch down in the right corner and there was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the revival and there was still a minute season... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou preaches by further weak Tacclings of the UK teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is like I was born in Fiji that 7 to play while UK still had to seeded.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is like that.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led basic changes to the half-time and completed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova ran through a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt to GB, made a Touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went long for long in favor of the South Seas, whose fans sang, banners and dancing on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the i dot dot with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounds, the Fijis shrouched and depressed the GB crushing down in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Past days, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-final with 20-5 and Britain urged South Africa into a tight half-finalmatch from the race - British transformation of difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half of the front, but Dan Norton took the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-eighth team secured the prize - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more strict gold than with these games and that wants to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes to the last, 220 hard Hieve, which will go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional importance in her golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who were sitting on the Ruder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was present as her as the second Olympiagold in the two without tax wife in a row, the first women in the history of the British sport, which laid down such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all its 39.19 unlawful use, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlete that glides over the surface with the elegance of pigs, which is not reflected the type of trium.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in rowing, there is a battalion to consent helpers that make the difference, and there was no more comfortable than the coach, who would not survive this day at all, when it was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had the bladder cancer, the operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads out everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather narrow situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was fortunate that he could be in early 2014, outside the season, could begin the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed the money, so I had to go better for me soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was at the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">So it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the infertility of victory, their first thoughts on Williams who spent a nervenous morning to talk a little more than usual and thus trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, who was a leader in the Royal artillery regiment in an deployment in Afghanistan, "I was a emotional wreck this week. that's maybe something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much me that means how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would have no one, therefore a massive thanks to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could not have a better person to work or want a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark were joined, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were stuck at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to ignore it.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a time for a year before making decisions more about its future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week at a wedding, your own with the TV adventurer Steve backend.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing seniors well</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing was accompanied by Ursel Kipp. as a young girl she was in school choir, in Lehrae study she finished the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"it moves me - emotional and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall live, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">She does something good in the side of her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">For singing, singing is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German senior League.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interaction, the seniors can bind and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">For frequently, social and family structures solve the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience also made Ursel Kipp in their choir: "talking and organize, to be able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of interaction."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be tiring in the positive sense, writes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">They convey a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whoever calls his lungs regularly, does not get so fast in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to get the sound of the voice in the age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In older people, singing often has a very special effect, "Ursula Lenz," says the Federal Association of seniors-organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the joint singing had a lot of job vacancy, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observed that singing or listening of songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, people are disinfected by himself in long periods.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, the head will also require a special achievement, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, concentrate on his own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone, do not only practice themselves to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is recognition that one learns through singing in choir, writes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is also growing in choir as well.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show itself: if I have long enough for something, I will boost better and watch over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent, will betray Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 sinking people, who is listening to it when there is a sound next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the appropriate offer, senior citizens offer various possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Someone is singing from the inner circle in a senior group, you can easily join in.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="32">Who wants to sing in a church choir, can turn right to the church or church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">There is also many senior choirs to be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for assistance in the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone who lust has to sing, should necessarily be connected to a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing the soul well and has something liberating - it applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="1">The right "identification movement" is in the Visier of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.</seg>
<seg id="2">After several country offices, the Constituent Constitutions have also placed the Group under observation.</seg>
<seg id="3">"we see the 'Identity movement' movement for ordering against the freedom of democratic principles," said Convictor Hans-Georg Maate the German Press agency in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thus, immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East will be diffused in the extremist way.</seg>

<seg id="6">The "identifiable movement" is a grouping with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="7">It turns against "Multicululti-Wahn," "uncontrolled mass migration" and the "loss of their own identity."</seg>

<seg id="10">The news and the indignation were spread far on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>

<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they may take such decisions," said the Chinese Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions in which they are safe or comfortable in what they say."</seg>

<seg id="2">A day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates of the American Fhockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, this does not know: the Americans are at 4-0 in the olympic competition and are still in their group with the Britons in the first place that were undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-final, the game will decide which the two will receive the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take the strong Dutch somewhat longer in the way that the other group will guide.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game is going out on Saturday, the Americans have caused a surprising effort by their success story, four years after the last London games finished in the last 12 squares.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a Hockeyderer in hands (their two older sisters played the Sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national player of the USA, the youngest in history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">They missed the Olympiad in 2008, since they could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team passed away everything.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things for better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workaround in London, which we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We can carry the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the cake in the first half of the game with a setback from the seam area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had been without victory in the tournament without victory in the game, but the team showed surprisingly heavy and kept the playing of 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She completed a Sprint with a flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and lupin the ball in the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez did the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the tournament for the goalkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in any of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late it is, the Olympic Games are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Rio de Janeiro's events feel steady and inescapable, a rapid relay between competition and pursuit.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic Fackel himself is a burning rod, which will protect from crossbow swimmer to Turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't switch on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue, without Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimples, would certainly have been sent to Prime Time, set up by sponsors and feel-being, if it would be a swimmers, Turner or even freal.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not lit any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, some in the shadow are the sports that are not broadly acknowledged: aerial guns, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always swim the breastswimming, and may reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I just want to make arguments for my particular darling, let me leave the attention on the discrete charm of trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the Trampolines have been a Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years had perceived that many, I had questioned, did not know that it is at all an Olympic port.</seg>
<seg id="14">It could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States sent athletes to competition, it has never gained a medal in the trampolines and made it a athlete until 2012, who managed it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians who share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outside side, partly because it sounds for an unenlightened ear for a clownsSchool than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only a horse enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonary tremor of his never swollen tuballs - but also the Grazie of gymnasium and diving, which combines two types of sports which are essentially ununited.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means a lot like" "" "springboard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rising winners jumping on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, real and saltos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to official documents for execution, difficulty level, level of difficulty and "flight time" are assessed.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio against each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic Vektor is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallion hoppers must go on in their quest for gold, quicker, upward and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and back, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They are not only hunting the finish line or the initial wall, but also a further cave goal: in the world or the Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted pursuit is nobel, very admired, even fanatic - and it's enough to even stir any viewers to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I'm feeling in listening to this games as a little tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing spell.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prunned, seemingly heavios like an astronaut, goes down, then downwards, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, just the dreadful, elegant uplifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition could only be with the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The preliminaries and final stages of women will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final positions as part of a follow-off block at two days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to oversee in general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase of consciousness is only achieved by anxiety and objectifying male athletes - as it proposed the male U.S. Turner according to The Wall Street Journal, then Mr Dooley expected to rinses his following air, new fans.</seg>

<seg id="3">Demonstrators urge political changes in Ethiopia, struggled to the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig protesters have been killed during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia straight together?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, there was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ban on the West with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months, protests against the government, the government and continued to spread themselves out more.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was ruthless, according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen were shot and killed on an unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some videos on the protests, probably from the last or earlier this year, show how security people beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The UN Authority for Human Rights needs now a prospective investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it was always difficult to hold this country and will become even more difficult," "" "Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa from the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely together with the Ethiopian in order to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded rapidly at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia had all other than a role model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually given the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted where dissidents were effectively taken to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or prison, or driven into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and have no other options except to protesting, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protesting.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land use up to the digging in relation to power the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widespread criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions continue along the border of Eritrea; a struggle against this zacky, disputed line requested in June hundreds of life.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts predict that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front, which had more or less forced in recent years, could use turbulence and could be armed again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of biting after years of mine ankles must now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years there were very many Ethiopian in the position to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones have always been more common and improved the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government closed access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via the internet proxies that hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave them that they were so protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are no natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since the end of all, the Amharas, who originate from Ethopia, mainly from Christian flooding in politics and economy, while they caught the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and live in lowlands.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, who make up about 6 per cent of the population and who are dominant in the military, in the intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was sentenced to death in a non-public condition in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts predict that he was particularly engaged in it, early signs of dissatisfaction and special contractors to use to process opponents and make it harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is lacking in this fundamental idea," "" "Mr Abdi said, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, from the northern Ethiopian region, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts predict that he does not enjoy confidence from the Tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the outcome will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such an uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections were protested by the government, which were seemingly stolen by the government and stolen them afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in the past few months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as new commuter train, as well as for its measurable progress in the poverty line.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intention of the internal misconceptions of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharian city, of Tigray managed businesses and hatred toward the Tigray is always more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts predict that protests in the United States and other Western allies are bringing in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for Dronger flights over the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West definitely wants to support democracy, he doesn't want to join his ally in a volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declared his assertion Obama was established ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by attacking his campaign, President Obama and Hillary Clinton had been the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification cast new questions on the communication skills of the Republicans in the Republicans, whether he was able to communicate and comprehensible to the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his mistreites who endeavour to take him during an eventful phase in protecting, to explain the actual position that he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made a campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump had made reference to the assertion on Thursday and insisted on interviews that he really did not intend to suggest the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was contrary to the previous day that Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation completely seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to weaken the statement by claiming that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the republican Presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism comes down to Mr. Trump, while he tried to focus on the focus of his campaign on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton thought the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried again to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">He warned about Twitter, that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and found that he had found his speech.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">In late July, he moved out strong criticism when he said that Russians should cut Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said "Naturally I thought the arctic table."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and return to ruin.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of its methods to test such as certain messages from his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary," set forth "according to what reaction falls." Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, observed the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he is smart enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of sharpened the clay for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an excellent sound because his refractive values are further backward.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a tour with a huge margin in the North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is tried not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to understand his testimony or misunderstood its humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he increases the focus of attention in the past few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought out his loyal fellow workers into the uncomfortable situation, irrespective of how provokant his testimony must also be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent owners, had great effort to defend candidates today in an CNN-interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I think what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "Mr. Giuliani said to the correctness of Mr. Truman's statements," "" "Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbitors, completely false and therefore it happened because he moved the troops out of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the Mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government served as an outdoor ministerial government, Clinton allowed ISIS to spread themselves, to spread the situation in the Near East under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Trump put up his attacks on the media and threw them before, on each of his words, and to be prieved against him.</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks usually come only in winter to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and is swimming with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönland sharks get offspring at the age of 150.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the bottom of the North Atlantic ocean along the bottom of the North Atlantic along an hour, it is just 1,220 metres far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five meters long animal accelerates to satte 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed it is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This loneliness shaped lifestyle appears, however, a patterness seems to be a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in any case by a Greenland shark which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "said Alexander Schadventure from the Max Planck Institute for demographic Research in Rostock this lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the Evolutionsbiologist projected that Greenland sharks become cobalt.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only missed the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenlandhaie are difficult to observe, eventually they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coastal coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water-temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear in the surface mostly in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers at the lifestyle of Greenland-haie know researchers according to little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her period of time, she, as she pointed out six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, this sharks make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another one had swallowed the pine nobles of a young icirons.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice cream and seek Kadaver, which torates from higher water layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenlandhaie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the biggest reaches of 502.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens of sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens emerges before the birth of sharks, which are contained in the proteins later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks were strikingly much carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the early 1960s, their birth should therefore be worse as atomic waffs experiments for larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the overall length of 220 centimeters, the linsenate contained a low surplus to carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it should have celebrated its 50th birthday at its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenlandsharks had the normal Carbon-14 quantities in their lens core, which emerges by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the Carbon-14 Clock for a 493 cm long Greenland sharks showed an age of 335 years while the record groi with 502 Zentimeters might even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenlanhai-females get caught only then, when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to submit an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold for sexual maturity and his age with 156 years was determined, Greenland haie with the reproduction obviously at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live primarily in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon garnished the neck of a 120 year old harpoon top, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Through the low temperatures often the organism of the animals live on sparks.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and down slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal has heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>

<seg id="8">From Horb it was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster's dear wife stands and so the Pilgrimage was driven off from Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual routes were drilled in the morning and in the evening by a short impetus with various prayers, songs and fonts.</seg>

<seg id="2">Schottlands Callum Skinner's last night in the male team Sprint in the Velodrome in Rio to fame as the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the role of his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy made herself to Ely. the young and made the legend proudly, when he was stormed to home a victory by the favorites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory over four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympians medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">It repeated the trick that she took place in March at the railway World Championships in London, despite the appearance of Hoys, a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as an execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap to close the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man, with whom they stayed, when they saw potential in the gravel, which now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy victorious - and Skinner sat down into the qualification round, but in the ranks, the New Zealander victorious in the first lap.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his turn left almost immediately, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy change made a large part of transformation, taking the Hindes into a higher gear, to slow down it and to allow it to keep pace, and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell to Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they got on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm only here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have set up a Olympiad in the final round and defeated the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just amazing.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the site Kenny and Hoys announced that he was intentionally infringing the train after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objecting of England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no problem with such a victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "he said," "" "It feels like the whole GB flags on the stand like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have joined the team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We came so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were obtained seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that's a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days at the bicycle stream.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the shape of knowledge it is in the realm of possible that he repeats Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be exactly 12 years younger than Hoy who was born on March 23 (a apparently holy date for the British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) were also a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">The might come from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the Sprint, which begins today and will start over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I enjoy this only for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team Event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>

<seg id="37">It was the only medallion competition of the day, but there were some good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified for the fastest performance in the four-four kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record that took place in London in 2012 was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final lap (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, at the Wiggins with safety in focus.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had fought yesterday with reference to the qualification, when functionaries were called to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, who will continue in the morning and will be retired, Laura Despite, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in the world war period in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team is relieved on his strong rail bike team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to take a lot of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio went down.</seg>
<seg id="46">It played Dramas in the background, so the resignation of technical laders Shane Sutton in April amidst the midst of sexism and bulbingu as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, when you see the first evening of the competition in the bicycle stream, it looks quite later than the legendary reputation GBS, which has reached the perfect moment its peak again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of aluminium carmelts from Portland, Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - are on the stake, since the plant operator will announce the energy supply contract and to raise all delivery contracts, as the supply of energy companies are announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step was followed by the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A maximinum payout set for 20 years is going on in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 jobs in the area of Alcoa in Portland.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 workplaces -direct and indirect - could be at risk of closing.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to Dominodeficiency, as the melting plant consumed around 10 per cent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa graduated from the Point of Henry, which led to an closing of the Anglesea power station last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risked an closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and lastly because of the current price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which serves the large aluminium shovy power plant with his Loy Yang A power plant in Latin America, shared with that three more owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The complex is located in the majority of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni corp are smaller shares.</seg>

<seg id="14">"" "AGL continued to continue that the" "" "safety transactions" "" "contracts were to have entered into force from November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="20">The U.S. company said that it had completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force in 2010, even if it is still a statement, why it came from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn due to the bad economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consume about 600 megawatts each year, and some 900 megawatts each year.</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents the klash of action with almost any birthday parties (Seacrest brought the sentence, "you thought that we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to take part in this publicity.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was most likely inhabitable for the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms, which resemble from climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have reported with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin, erdwardly atmosphere, and still slowly turned off.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lit the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet is thought to have more dry places than the Earth, but had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected against evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun which was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow revolution of Venus declared their daily side of the sun for nearly two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which seems like a umbrella to shielding the surface of much of the sun heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus, which resembles the evolution, previously suspected of planetary research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although they were presumably inhabitable, Venus had been exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several thousand years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans are evaporated and their steam vapour was burnt out of ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today.</seg>

<seg id="24">In a recent study, the R-Secure's security researchers investigated the user interfaces and the contact with the blackmail and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer care to increase more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They declare their victims per chat, as they can pay per bitcoin, set free accessible support websites, or decrypt for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And private people will be delivered to payments of a few hundred Euros, businesses have to pay hard-negotiate and pay five-digit sums in order to regain their data.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of potentially high and relatively risky profits from the Ransomware Erpressway the hackers become increasingly professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski from the SOPHOS Antivirus provider: "a single person can write a Ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely, however, is that it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutants software then in the form of a software structure to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by the malware self, consulting and additional tools for one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "included is a adaptive tool, so that smaller configuration, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "Wisniewski says." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailing are then looking for further hackers to spread the fresh-purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log into one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal and commissioned to install the software on as many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infallized machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminal investigators apply spammers" "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now well-known for many companies that improve their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies in the Malwarebytes survey put confidence in Ransomware using file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are pursuing new strategies already.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone has no sufficient threat to successful detection, the perpetrators instead with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations," explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">As a result, the potential for damage is much higher than before, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could also deliver new goals in the internet of things on the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerconference Defcon demonstrated security researchers, as they were able to get a connected thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the heating of a derart could certainly be worthy of such a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators, instead of blocking the heating in the future, block the whole factory road in a factory, Ransomware could also be a subject in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, there is eternally walking around, at night you are awake and wake up, in the morning there is no longer thinking about sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one has problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults sleeping and more than ten percent find their sleep frequent or permanent as a non-relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How can sleep problems or sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and they can be destroyed with various causes, Hans-Günter Weaver, board member of the German Society for Schlaffing and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands, however, is the insomnie, i.e. one entry and the sleeping disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just having gone through to sleep many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht says, board member at the German homework association with practice in the Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disturbances are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">These are organic, psychological or behavioral factors behind it, but also medications are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleep disorder expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early wake up is often common with depression," "" "says Wei." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that various factors need each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, who has a herniated disc, can be bad, waking up every two to three hours and starts blurred on everyday problems and worry, there is no example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I sleep with sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a month in at least three nights a week, and is affected by day, should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look different: one is beaten, tired, tired, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To ease the sleep disorder, it is important to find their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As an treatment options, behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or even drugs - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional case and at most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">Headquartered in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fixed, Head of Interdisciplinary Research Centre at the Charité University Medicine Berlin, Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, one should take care of sleep problems first at the infarst, advises white.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can clarify with examinations, whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go into sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in the sleep laboratory, medical examination, for example, in snoring with respiratory sufferers, at diseases of sleep or when you can't find the cause of a sleep disorder, explains fixation.</seg>
<seg id="27">You do not have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "says Fixed." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After blinking you go to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body you have a nose goggles, a chest strap and a antennas on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera paints a camera on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can I get the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of screws, on which one can get for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weaver counts on: regular sleep and upset, not too long in bed, don't sleep to sleep, don't sleep to sleep, alcohol, and at night do not begin to look at the clock - then you begin to reckon immediately, and that is absolutely not promoting.</seg>

<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents drew rental agreements, but on the ground floor are more space occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the beginning of the year, the Berlin Innensenator handle had repeatedly called for a tough advance of the police against the project, the area called "no-go-zone" for police officers and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, patched the police for three weeks with official statements by 30 to 40 officials and three team van on the spot, locked parts of the road, and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown housekeeper the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On July 13, a Berlin district court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and one day later, police and builders moved under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the road looks peaceful: parents go with children, sitting at the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are entertain late late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many citizens: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the "" "" Kiez "" "" since 1999, and Jana *, who is here three children, are mainly driven by the police presence. "" "</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the hood, they share the care of rising rents and gunelectrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound after a "Kiez," who wanted to unwanted majority of police protection from vandals on the left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin Innensenator and the police make up between houses and their neighbours, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional workers "district, which also today compared to the rest of the city a lower average income and high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also houses and the resulting living projects belong to the "Kiez:" in 1990, numerous houses have been occupied by the former East Germany, including almost the entire mainstream street near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared out of a regular police station, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are partly inhabited by people today, who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district in recent years has become increasingly become magnets for tourists and electing liners from all over the world, with them now local people from GDR times and former home-heretics rested their "Kiez."</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable with the rents that have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them on the designed discs or freshly knitted facades which were cast in color.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year so often with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for this, that not all neighbours therefore may be considered a problem, could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes like body injurifying statistics thus almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of offences make real damage, which tend to meet new buildings and fresh renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house for 17 years next to the controversial 94 years, uncertainty can be no speech.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, they complain about: people in 94 are their neighbours who have not been determined.</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous burning cars also give it right in the Rigaer no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For studying architect, her street is not a criminal law, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more apart from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously dragged into the Rigaer street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore it was also so important that the residents get back their streets: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly stressed the interpretation of the area in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents as Neugebauer the road will continue to be taken away: in a secured new building in former buildings which the old residents are pushing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee service</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in terms of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, she is social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee service for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagoges support the team of administration for Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It appears as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group refugees, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the working group indicates that Deut's honourable is more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, who have been experiencing wool milchsau, which has primarily a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less mocking more than rather on the multitude of desired upsets - meant - as the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We are looking for administration with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long experience in the field of social work, just an affensative wool milksy.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the administration is not their central area, Annika Deuschle says.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with people on the spot, and behind the scenes and network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been around for six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">She has completed a 50-percent spot on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine Customer that Annika Deuschle supports honesty and full official stakeholders." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">The new container in the Wasenstraße are soon available.</seg>
<seg id="17">There has been a grave problem since some time, apartments for connecting flights which have been recognised.</seg>
<seg id="18">Communes are responsible for the connection of the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You need to accommodate refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations have to carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Regional Office of the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer its apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration doesn't find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it does not work until you have to rely on private dwellings, Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, general apartments must be intimidated as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, there are internships, training courses, courses, one-euro jobs and helpless activities for refugees and migrants who have to become punged or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house-master, do non-profit work - and the motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But it does not work only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and Customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a prescription.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">Thus, management and ambition are also allowed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It was central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You need to explain the refugees that it will take time to make it possible, for example, with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who sometime make the feeling that he could not help in Urbach wouldn't work and be unprofitable, who will never be able to integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">There are also problems, but also says customer honest, "People who doesn't go at all." the work of Deuschle and client is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two are afraid of radicalization, even in a small church like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "" "" "" "No," "" "says Regine Customer quite clearly," "" "what some people may call naive." "" "a residual risk could and would not exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the subject of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassin would complete them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Client.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So, main and honourable must take place in the region and in the region after activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new push for refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Do Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This is clear to answer, they are afraid of politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place them helpers on-site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we have not arrived there where we would like," "" "Annika Deuschle says." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbacher already fasted that people are reasonable to integrate the previous people.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, one should help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no easy answers.</seg>
