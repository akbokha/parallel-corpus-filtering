Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ ze actions in the Middle East .
it is said to be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been spann@@ ed for years .
Washington is critic@@ ising the ongoing settlements of Israel and is due to lack a lack of resolve to the peace process .
through the deal raises by Obama , the Iran &apos;s nuclear programme has deterior@@ ated further .
in March , Netanyahu had an invitation to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress that was partly cont@@ ested against Obama .
speaking with Obama , this meeting was rejected with Obama at the time of the forth@@ coming election in Israel .
in an emer@@ gen@@ cies , Professor , shot his friend killed
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Schröder , with a somewhat ab@@ dic@@ ate voice of the police , said he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
lamb , it was important to empha@@ size that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; yet live and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house , officers of Amy P@@ ren@@ tic@@ s and a handwritten note was that I wanted to reverse it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was written according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed from Lamb .
there was no indication that lamb , who set up in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already travelled for 300 miles to the school grounds where he was killed and killed by the police for a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ sch@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that all of the staff members have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that lamb did the fatal emergency call eventually .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cled him .
one day after shooting in the university , students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to proc@@ ure themselves a picture which are motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , including what students and staff who knew him , helped me to draw a picture of a talented , but perhaps difficult teachers .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where P@@ ren@@ tic@@ i died , said he did not have a history of violence or criminal affairs .
in one of his written book , Schmidt noted , in whom he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both were employed in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teachers included 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some disp@@ utes about proble@@ matic behaviour .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ ers , the Lamb married , said he seemed a bit excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said lamb had told him to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
according to recent changes in the employment policy of the university , that the promotion , designed for the Lamb so hard , had no guarantee for an automatic way to be established as Assistant Professor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b imag@@ inations . &quot;
these are questions that cannot answer any more .
after the run out of the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs road until he returned to Mississippi from Arkan@@ sas .
before he was arrested , he killed himself compl@@ ying with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran in the drive .
it wasn &apos;t immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew the people living there .
lamb grew up in the area .
lamb , in 2009 , began working at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he graduated in ped@@ agog@@ y in the spring .
one of the long @-@ standing girl@@ friends called him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said that she was 15 and the Lamb was 20 , when they met together with common friends .
they and her friends were high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach guitar playing guitar .
he was the Women &apos;s s@@ warm .
all girls are melted down when he was there , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Bran@@ don .
lamb and P@@ ren@@ tic@@ i were obviously some time together .
in the notebook , &apos; I killed my wife , &apos; but there was no certificate from a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick @-@ house , ang@@ ain to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of P@@ ren@@ tic@@ s , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and one daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he has never met lamb , but with his daughter Abig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
lamb met P@@ ren@@ tic@@ s when he and Abig@@ ail took two years ago in a summer @-@ fair .
later they played along one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
P@@ ren@@ tic@@ i was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender , and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished lamb and P@@ ren@@ tic@@ on Night in the night of September 5th when Lamb completed his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before an angry audience .
there wasn &apos;t any evidence that something was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were on the premises and jo@@ king together .
I mean , they both had a good sense for joke .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first term seminar program and focused on American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people participated in the Delta State University in Cleveland , including lecturer , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the amazing watch while the &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to return our students to returning , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ geli@@ o So@@ lis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana ( New Orleans ) contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to contra@@ di@@ ct that the police had said that lamb had shot the emer@@ gen@@ cies when he described Schmidt , and that lamb had described in his notebook P@@ ren@@ tic@@ es as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox will be jo@@ king about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a major moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater to the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat is next to me , and it is slowly clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;

UN chief says , there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon ad@@ mits his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen mis@@ ing thousands of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN leader calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integ@@ rative negotiations for finding a political solution .
ban has said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member countries of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of the Assembly &apos;s meeting in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the changes in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ solv@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban requested the five permanent members , in order to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in Syria , that they have demonstrated in the submission of an nuclear deal with Iran .
8 sound values show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have taken it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans are trying to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper edges in the p@@ olls on the bottom , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national p@@ olls presented Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate @-@ Mog@@ uls .
it is , of course , too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts empha@@ size that at this time , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership had been handed over to the upcoming Herman Cain , none of them only won a state in the Nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ lines like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth recognise Tr@@ um@@ ps en@@ fe@@ eb@@ elt and begin to run down their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values , which suggests that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey carried out by the Mon@@ mouth University that only two of ten Republican @-@ real estate companies had a positive effect .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers keep in the United States .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa decided that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P were happy with tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey by CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans were reported either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
just two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed , &quot; if he would be the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would &quot; exc@@ ites &quot; vs. 40 percent , who would say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next one in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republican voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favourite of the establishment , the candidate .
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely used for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the voters think that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l have the right temper@@ ament to a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the first country &apos;s country nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander in Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six out of 10 Un@@ abhängi@@ ge say that his temper@@ ament does not take to the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republican elec@@ tors are getting used to the idea .
if they set up their gel@@ ress , Republican elec@@ tors hold back to real .
if they &apos;re asked who won the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , a survey conducted by CNN / OR@@ C will say four out of ten , that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
that is a change since the time when four out of July put their money to J@@ eb Bush .
full dis@@ closure : GO@@ P voters had not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at that point in the last cycle , four of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans were thinking that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination from just 28 % for the final candidates , Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P voters think Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign will be a plau@@ sible campaign .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans hit another candidate , Tr@@ ump proposes almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fra@@ gment field is likely to work in tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump Support has been distributed to more than a dozen other candidate diff@@ us .
but one survey from the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump advised the majority support .
he left Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of rim Paul , John Ka@@ isa and Chris Christie 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate , who hits it ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ Fans says that they have formed their mind .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half the voters , who support the tr@@ ump , say that they have forgiven their voices .
of course , much happened to change that , and no one can really say to never change the opinion .
46 per cent said they open the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the Neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters that they have formed their mind are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
ever since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago , Em@@ bers in Mexico called &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; was immigration and fishing in the public dis@@ course of 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic output of Tr@@ ump @-@ based His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republican party and damage the re @-@ oriented efforts .
but following the new ABC / post study of Monday , six of the 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that it coinci@@ des with Tr@@ ump on issues of immigration .
so long as the immigration remains in the lim@@ el@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do too .
the fru@@ strations over the government clim@@ bs to new distances .
like Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , there are now around half of the support of Republican voters , mainly through their out@@ si@@ der status .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the new Mont@@ es@@ days survey by ABC / Post , they would prefer to represent a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience .
and they are also anger@@ ed in Washington .
a survey carried out by Des Mo@@ ines register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa before two weeks shows that three of four I@@ owa @-@ Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated against the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 per cent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts of Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ky Way , the most expensive residential community - with a view over the North Sea ew@@ at@@ ts .
the street is designed to cost a square meter of a wooden hospital at an average of 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is limited , &quot; it is in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows , in which particular layers is one square meter the most costs .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student residence in Munich are not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top residential areas , one of the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
real Estate Service Engel &amp; V@@ ölk@@ ers has made a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square prices in dizz@@ ying heights .
there are several t@@ enth@@ s of nothing - per square meter , mind you .

Champions League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two sc@@ orer in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ star Thomas Müller has a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller &apos;s way to FC Bayern the way to a earned 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus , then ran .
a sovereign pre@@ lu@@ de of the Champions League @-@ season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze , who dra@@ gged a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the arm@@ chair of Pi@@ raeus .
the crew by coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her debut game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ 3 + 2 ) and Göt@@ z matches ( 8@@ 9th ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th star in the series will be the first step towards the finale on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola wants to finally get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller was received by the Champions League in the Champions League to the Bayern regional leadership of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart MEP Roberto , who had happened as a f@@ lange of the world champion .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate that , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ame promised before the play in the Kar@@ a@@ is@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 fans - and the Munich designated word .
they showed a concentrated and eng@@ aging idea , not to shine .
Pi@@ raeus had won six home matches in the royal class , including clubs as Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 I moved to Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
however , in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , Bayern didn &apos;t want to be the next victims .
they went cour@@ ageous , with their evident efforts , but often to inv@@ ade deeds .
the attacks were often initiated by playing on Lin@@ ks@@ ha@@ ki Douglas Costa , who seldom passed on the earlier Braunschwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more fortunate from the right to beat his flan@@ k from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute , world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski &apos;s best occasions in half one .
first of all , when the Olympic Der Stür@@ mer Brown proposed the Pole &apos;s head ball ( 26 ) .
then via direct arrest , Tor@@ wart MEP Roberto with the knee ( 3@@ 5th ) .
although the Bavaria reg@@ ained its usual game , Pi@@ raeus was able to place i@@ fer@@ ti@@ ses .
but at Tor@@ ch@@ ter Manuel New it was a decree .
so , as he got a shot from ide@@ ye about the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
recently , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a square chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng which made it good .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero was given the green light only after finishing the closing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport@@ presented Matthias Sim@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone wants to make something different this is v@@ icious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola came to him on the first change when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the complex Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and later made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller made one better .
before the game , it was station@@ ed in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly infl@@ ated Bayern @-@ fans in their viewers @-@ block evi@@ dently prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pir@@ a@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with b@@ ang@@ es against the Munich p@@ endants .

everyone smo@@ kes , has increased risk of losing teeth
whoever rou@@ ching , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that takes a long @-@ term study near Potsdam .
the good news : in aband@@ on@@ ment reduces the risk of fast .
smokers have a significantly higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this investig@@ ates the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several members of the German Institute of Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers only there was the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to tell the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ tor@@ rent .
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ ,000 participants .
main causes for dental treatment , cavi@@ ties and inflammation of the gum , empha@@ sizes DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking a risk factor , empha@@ size the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore applies to frequent gum disease in smokers .
does not clari@@ fy , however , smoking reduces the risk of cavi@@ ties .
people who stopped smoking at the ship could decrease their risk but in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
it could take place over ten years , until the threat comes back to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained First author Thomas Dietrich from the English University Birmingham .
one has to convince people to be non @-@ smoking , the director of H@@ einer Boeing . DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking takes the life time . &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and also leads to good dental health until high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of people aged 65 to 74 years have been affected by in@@ action , the DI@@ f@@ E distributed .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking takes the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study exam@@ ines the findings .

EU Commission proposes in dispute over TT@@ IP a new court
the EU Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current Ar@@ bit@@ ration system to achieve the proposed Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TT@@ IP ) .
the controversial private ch@@ anc@@ ill@@ boards in disp@@ utes between companies and states are therefore to be replaced by a transparent system , which is significantly more traditional in its functionality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S @-@ Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström at the idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de introduced the proposal to negoti@@ ate a European negoti@@ ating position on the US Free Trade Area .
the German government announced backing .
TT@@ IP is forced to develop the largest free trade zone of the world with 800 million people .
the plans on reform of the current arbit@@ ration procedures fail to realize that the EU states and the US select independent judges for a new EU investment programme .
they are to join the same parts from the EU , the U.S. and third @-@ country states .
one second instance is provided for the first time .
she would allow it to rise up against judgments .
so far , the rules involved s@@ inter@@ ed each other on refer@@ ee , a demanding task against their judgments , did not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens not trusted the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice failed to Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it aims to work according to an International Investment Court .
there might be disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU countries , for example .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proce@@ eding primarily from large corporations ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the main reasons for major resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
however , the traditional arbit@@ ers are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ jus@@ tic@@ ated by the company . account@@ ants of the tax@@ pay@@ ers can extend the national laws or cut a decrease of consumer and environmental standards .
in initial statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act ass@@ ert the proposals of the EU Commission as inadequate .
it has been primarily critic@@ ised that it should not be negotiated for the free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economy of state Matthias Mach@@ ines ( SPD ) described the plans by contrast as big progress .
in the spring of Reform , the Commission co @-@ ordin@@ ates significant points , the Federal Minister of Economics , Sig@@ mar Gabriel built up in the spring of other EU Trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration may be from the table .
the French government welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Business association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Business@@ Europe warned against switching the financial possibilities of the economy by too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , the name was commanded .
when the discussions on the Free Trade Agreement ( TT@@ IP ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , continues to be un@@ clear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States .
originally a framework for the agreement was expected to stand at the end of this year .
this date is no longer considered .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan went to the stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him there is a fli@@ pchart , which has recorded the timi@@ dated torture singer , the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan , with felt pen .
the whole audience , about 40 persons , is almost caught by Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells about various places he always draw on the map , including his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they were created and what it looks like there , in his homeland .
since then Stev@@ ens proves to be wonderful creative minds .
launched in 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear smart compos@@ ing songs that harmon@@ ically f@@ lowed very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but could be fantastic at any time .
it is the rum@@ our that &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a ver@@ itable series : each of the 50 states must be covered in a row .
but in 2004 and near the sea the &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; had already been released and showed positive expectations .
Stev@@ ens cross herself up here .
live enough for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musicians living in New York are returning to the series .
in &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The &quot; oise &quot; ) is released in 2005 a nationwide master@@ piece .
over@@ l@@ ord@@ ingly on ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and no one is missing in any key list of the influential musical media .
after extremely productive forces , Stev@@ ens then served on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) .
this sixth studio album is still largely orchest@@ rated , but supported by programm@@ atic sequences or beats , and plays with all kinds of effect and hall .
the stage shows on stage shows that the stage shows are shown here for the colorful spectacle of Ne@@ on @-@ Stir@@ n@@ b@@ ons and fluorescent tube @-@ du@@ vet .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens tou@@ red as part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .
in the dark @-@ held ham@@ bur@@ gers More !
Theater presents itself mainly the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; which has been available since March .
though nearly 2000 guests are allowed to sit in their chairs , the Stev@@ ens beg@@ ging back to in@@ timacy and folk .
without saying a word to the audience , the audience plays excellent musicians through the broad @-@ enriched album .
you can hear from the audience : the talk was &quot; opul@@ ent , &quot; and so I can throw the &quot; plate in the bottom . &quot;
until a en@@ core , Stev@@ ens would like to thank him , plays acou@@ sti@@ cally some older songs and finally dis@@ likes tos@@ sing applause .
Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s findings
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s findings have been eag@@ erly a@@ waited
the new Labour @-@ Chair , Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , will debut with David Cameron &apos;s fra@@ gment for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will inc@@ ite to ask the first of his six pre@@ defined questions , where its performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs from the near .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some meetings to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because it comes to his appointment as a member of the Board of Directors and after his intervention at the TU@@ C annual session on Tuesday .
meanwhile , during a commem@@ oration of the National An@@ them in silence at a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS are prov@@ oked and at the centre of several fron@@ ts stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to sing the National An@@ them , has attracted attention .
a speaker by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence . &quot; and he recognized that &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the Air Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ir@@ on@@ ett , Owen Smith , at the BBC Two News@@ night Program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the National An@@ them , &quot; independent of his faith that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and it calls on dis@@ agreements in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary party originally supported him as leader .
the political reporter of the BBC , Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; st@@ acked within the Labour &quot; and in accordance with Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limit of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference to make Labour change to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ labour and pensions minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government &apos;s plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 pounds to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , ever since he is T@@ ory chief , over the last decade , over the Dis@@ patch box in parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chair , who promised an other political principle , says that he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crowd @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions of Mr Cameron and given him more than 30.000 ideas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the parliamentary majority of the Prime Minister is to con@@ front confron@@ t@@ ational and that he is opposed to contra@@ dic@@ ting and with resistance to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who is represented by the shadow Minister of Business , if he doesn &apos;t participate , for example , if Mr Cameron is traveling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation , that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he said John Ber@@ s@@ cow , speaker of the sub @-@ house , addressed to discuss the problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he is concerned about politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le The@@ aters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who often is associated with the start of Prime Minister . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when she was first sent to television in 1990 , the scene with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position under his par@@ liament@@ arians , although the critics have argued that it has become a caric@@ ature and require further reforms .

pound grows by accelerated growth growth in the UK
the pound so@@ ared immediately after data , which has an increase in wage growth in the UK . at the same time , FT@@ SE was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller &apos;s target group .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % over the same period last year .
this percentage had been the fastest and recorded ass@@ essments on the timing of interest rates since 2009 .
the pound increased by more than 1 % compared to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro on 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the most outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after takeover of the ri@@ vals AB In@@ Be@@ v was entered .

Bur@@ berry shares were calculated according to encouraging news from the competition Group for luxury goods Ri@@ chem@@ ont was 0.9 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - returns again .
shares of G@@ LE@@ N@@ CO@@ RE increased 5 % after the cre@@ ed@@ ging had said that he took $ 2.5 billion by a share sale as part of its strategy of debt .
the shares of packaging and paper @-@ based MON@@ DI were the biggest los@@ ers in the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sachs had its assessment for the company rating on &quot; sale . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose 3.1 % after the sport @-@ changing company had reported pre @-@ tax result of € 4@@ 6.6 million for the half year .
the CEO of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are beyond the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ p@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more buying power in the po@@ ckets of the potential customers .
but it is unlikely that this purchase force will compens@@ ate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the costs could meet expansion plans from J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are less work@@ places .

it is both - and in the potato mas@@ king , which the Ol@@ den@@ burg I@@ mb@@ al owner , Han@@ i Al@@ hay , has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a label on the Pe@@ aks movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat was put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is mul@@ ticul@@ tural for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ hay writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to the agency , it has been protected as a practical model .
how much meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer does , Al@@ hay doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y .

Met@@ cash starts Com@@ miss@@ al Com@@ miss@@ al campaign against the fight of al@@ di@@ - incur@@ sion
Met@@ cash is trying to protect IG@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di &apos;s advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a tren@@ ch campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di has opened the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , strengthen Met@@ cash and IG@@ A @-@ supermarkets with local food suppliers and marketing via the social media , as well as events such as Adelaide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , who distri@@ butes samples in IG@@ A stores and shop owner who would sell to faithful customers for the South Australian League .
cash funds will be expected to make further details of its defence strategy on September 29th , when the wholes@@ aler gets through food , alcohol and equipment , through annual investors .
it is much on the game where South Australia and Western Australia comprise almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A @-@ Lad@@ der and higher profit mar@@ gins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in eastern countries .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland boo@@ sts more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in eastern Australia .
but analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets , roughly five percent of the food market in these two states will take away and all available players , but mainly independent retail outlets .
according to a report published in this week , the analysts Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley revealed that IG@@ A retailers could lose 360 billion in turnover per year and cash payments 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di was opened in the next year 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and markets and in quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed costs could cost Met@@ cash roughly 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in eastern states , mainly on Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found out that IG@@ A professionals are the most faithful .
Morgan Stanley takes growth of met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and market by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce their market share by 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told that it would likely to disappear within a decade of business in Melbourne .
Met@@ cash refused to respond to the comments made by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass has taken contact last week .
IG@@ As Market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ - food trade and food trading , which has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operating debt reduction in balance between turnover and mar@@ gins .
the wholes@@ al@@ ers , however , is investing more than 150 million $ to improve sales prices with Col@@ es and Wool@@ wor@@ ths by hundreds of products each week with improving their shops through faster @-@ growing fresh food and deliver a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main business@@ man Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price read@@ ju@@ st@@ ments and charging program programmes are going to starter and hopes that big dealers will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise to be a cri@@ tique for his behavior .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al@@ ity &quot; in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Ap@@ gios and ear@@ ns for his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian tennis Association Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is always described as &quot; Special KS , &quot; has got into the lim@@ el@@ ight for the not@@ orious transition from Kyr@@ os with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters .
in a fier@@ y qualifying match in Cincinnati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison were sent twice through the refer@@ ee . he called out : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to strike the church , and I should strike the child . &quot;
during he was last seen how he dis@@ assembled a tennis ra@@ cket , after having a cra@@ mp up a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is at Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am quite jeal@@ ous is the fact that after my view someone has taken a little in the fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost one of the sei@@ zu@@ res in the US Open , but he is not the first player to have a ra@@ cket out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of that .
but , really , he really proved himself in the US Open extremely well , even under the quite pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on and I think he deser@@ ved a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around , and I think he was treated as little too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he is working very hard , and he does not have a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is good in form , he is a very strong and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to its own services .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take into account the Kyr@@ os on arrival , which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; than the right place for everybody , but he guarantees the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term permanent feature . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversy surrounding &#91; Kyr@@ gio &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe Nick has managed very quickly , for which people like Feder@@ er and Murray have pointed out . he clim@@ bs to the eyes of the public , but we are trying to make it clear . some time outside the spotlight she can only think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency , closes the border , with@@ holds refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency position and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and all detained , who tried to come illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed on the border as hundreds of migrants re@@ acted with indig@@ nation in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and responded with indig@@ nation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people who fled from violence were down to an unknown period in a country stre@@ ak on the road between the two controls of the countries , and built tents , and settled there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but fru@@ strations rose .
as a police helicopter on them , the migrants &quot; opening the border ! &quot; and cried out ins@@ ults against Hungarian stra@@ tion@@ ists .
some exp@@ ose the lack of food and water .
Serbian Foreign Affairs declared that it was &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back from Hungary during more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ al@@ ment .
it has to take place in the coming days of talks with Brussels and other countries , &quot; Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the turbul@@ ence in the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border ended up one day after the 28 @-@ nation @-@ block at a strict meeting in Brussels called no united immigration policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who had sought refuge in the sur@@ facing Italy and Greece . they expressed their hopes that finally - the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement that the EU states would absorb additional 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
on Tuesday , Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit on the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , retained its hopes on an early act of Brussels or of his neighbors .
the emergency was o@@ rested on Tuesday in two southern regions , there were more powers to speed up the crisis so that they could accelerate roads and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country was also building a bar@@ bed wire wi@@ z@@ us along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants in the country - after finishing it to a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison doors were deployed during the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in the past few months Hungary , Hungary for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entrance point to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most incoming business refugees are looking for a better life , and not of war @-@ refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany .
the new laws created around midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ uns , who issued the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws apply even higher pen@@ alties for convicted traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government loud@@ speaker Z@@ olt@@ an Kov@@ acs Rep@@ orters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military , which is expected next week but rep@@ orters of Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , the country &apos;s security adviser to Or@@ ban , said that authorities have 45 people over the attempt to cross the border , 15 others have already penet@@ rated into the country .
they come across by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in custody and are accused of committ@@ ing off@@ ences to the new laws .
authorities are trying to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos changed the most important Gren@@ zen@@ ge close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data from people and pushed a human quantity to get there .
approximately 20 managed to get into it , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the major motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they arrive in Hungary .
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national pol@@ l
the former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continued to keep a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hit her opposite the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters for the presidential election ( 58 percent previously ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rising by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced his presidency to the Presi@@ dency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential election .
more than five months before the preliminary election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ tons Supp@@ orters are more volatile than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News study , Clinton lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders scored some prizes .
Clinton keeps a big advantage in women and women , but these origins have decreased .
her support in men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points .
Clin@@ ton &apos;s benefit in democratic voters for 50 years has volatile , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
but Clinton had a big advantage in the older voters .
in the previous month , Clinton had a double @-@ digit margin in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders had a 5 @-@ point advantage in that group .
about half of the democratic voters of the election report argue that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm when it was nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
not surprising , however , that Clin@@ t &apos;s current supporters are particularly thrilled .
the views are more mixed with those who don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the voters say that they will support Clinton with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can voters say this about their leading candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ ton supporters can be asked in an open question , why they want to be securing the right experience ( 16 per cent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman president ( 13 per cent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Secretary of Clinton &apos;s supporters , Clinton &apos;s contact with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) also men@@ tions them .
consent to dealing with problems and elec@@ torate is also quoted .
as the vice president raises the potential for the Presi@@ dency &apos;s Presi@@ dency , 57 percent of the voters want to see him in the race - although one @-@ third believes he does not have to do it .
if a democratic voters are asked for the election who were their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is on the top .
from Clin@@ t &apos;s followers more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
and doesn &apos;t decide for the nom@@ ination of demo@@ cr@@ ats , Hillary Clinton sharp@@ ens his advantage in front of S@@ anders , of 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of the democratic voters will see Clinton as can@@ di@@ ers with the best chance to win the election , however , that number dropped by 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; choices &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important to the candidates , Democratic voters call a question of voters .
similar to the last month , no single democra@@ t candidate or potential candidate for the election is un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidate , or potential candidates , bring good results in some important features of the party &apos;s sel@@ ections .
multi @-@ qualities must be considered Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest , trust@@ worthy and powerful lead qualities .
with the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts the lead among hon@@ esty , which is the lead of Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength .
thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is sin@@ c@@ ely and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of it .
Democratic voters of the presidential elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions concerning Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of having a personal e @-@ mail address and an officer during the term as Foreign Minister , the majority of the Democratic Elec@@ toral votes are pleased with their explanation of the affair and say that their opinions didn &apos;t affect their opinions .
but it is a different story in the US public .
half of the Americans are un@@ happy with their declaration while only one @-@ third is satisfied .
the public opinion of this happened in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most of the Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on their general opinion on Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion was still wor@@ sen@@ ed .
it is mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views are worse than Clinton .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trusted by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of voters are entitled to an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of voting rights nationwide can be seen in tr@@ ump as well and not trust@@ worthy .
but Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , have good grades with guidance .
out of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best among hon@@ esty .
a majority sees S@@ anders more than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of it .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters at the current term is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is approaching a nationwide survey of Donald Tr@@ ump on
Ben Car@@ son is located close to the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times and behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the two Can@@ did@@ ates , half of the votes cast out in the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
Republican elec@@ tors support nationwide p@@ umping in large numbers . the support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey carried out by Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , by 27 % in the pol@@ l of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son notes from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well @-@ educated in demo@@ graphic groups and hits Tr@@ ump under republi@@ can voters .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio , John Ka@@ ert , is defeated by the Wis@@ con@@ sins Governor Scott Walker , who is at the lowest point out of 10 % over the last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida Governor J@@ eb Bush , former Governor of Arkan@@ sas , Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third place .
the error mar@@ row in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son ends in the p@@ olls , with 19 % support in the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the p@@ umping with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed that Tr@@ ump is significantly driven by Car@@ son .
with a view to this rising in the last week Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found some side hi@@ kes to the former neurolog@@ y , even after Car@@ son revol@@ ted to question Tr@@ um@@ ps belief in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign presentation in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;

five members of the Brotherhood , with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ new@@ com@@ ings
almost two years after a student during a student @-@ like ritu@@ als as a student link in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , passed away , murder charges have been filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si bro@@ therhood provided by Ch@@ un : Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an execution ritual in September 2013 and delayed its transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , the police informed us .
officials said he was loaded with connected eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked , while he tried to go to a frozen field over a frozen field .
after all , Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , and then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si bro@@ therhood call not calling the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes to contact D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothing to contact his symptoms , and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , said Bill Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members of the profession had begun to hide and made the welfare of the Brotherhood in general about Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ er@@ ef Wagner .
he couldn &apos;t be revi@@ ved , and he died at his injuries on the next morning .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g has been repeatedly added with bl@@ asted force of injuries to head , tor@@ so and upper th@@ igh .
&quot; many families were destroyed by the ban@@ anas of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies each year to the Sch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members have to be held accoun@@ table , and this step of authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment due to slaughter @-@ third degree for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of complex attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t only want to make the involved people responsible , but if there is an organization , which - officially or in@@ official - this sanc@@ tioned , we will also draw this to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has resi@@ sted its belonging to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed raises interest
a interest rate will come , and the house is going to wan@@ ing in doubt , ren@@ dering to bonds , and the economy is managed to slide into a recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know how long it will last , how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only low instruction to exp@@ end .
a recession came within only 11 months after the initial interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor contributing to the economy and financial investments .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. central bank have so strongly empha@@ sized that investors ought not to focus on and when it begins to increase interest rates , rather on the time that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could find , however , that the whole excitement might be exagger@@ ated due to interest income .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first raise of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is interpreted is inev@@ it@@ ably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Julian J@@ ess@@ op , head economist at Capital Economics , in a communication of customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal al@@ titudes , but still on too low level to lead to the se@@ is@@ mic shock , which seem to be afraid .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here &apos;s a view of historical trends , based on how some areas of the business could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate interest can make matters for a while .
once the increase enters , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seem to be a tendency to be di@@ ced from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps once again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German bank analysts in a recent study to what will happen after interest rate hike . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market is usually found in the upward trend - approximately 14 percent - on the way to interest rate hike , rather flat in the 250 days after the rate of interest ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) according to a recent analysis , by Bob D@@ oll , boss &apos;s unit strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tend to occur later in the increases cycle and the return is to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rate increases them often .
in the case , the F@@ ed is confron@@ ted with some conditions that did not exist before and accelerate the recession .
it is highly remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a interest rate in the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , only twice the nominal GDP was under 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only few should expect this to happen , and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter .
interest rate in such frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; Deutsche Bank said .
market participants have taken the whole year on a interest rate by the F@@ ed , and all eyes were aimed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could prove an increase in this session , Fut@@ ures trading is only a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study , all increased cycles of 1950 to today have taken place in a super @-@ cycle , increasing the GDP growth and pre @-@ rec@@ sion@@ ing heights very quickly after recovery in the shadow , &quot; says the report .
in contrast , this is a clearly long recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was .
the current cycle is by far the longest one has been waiting for the last recession since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and so far 74 months have been waiting .
solid income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , as the market takes a interest rate hike , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than stocks , if they change their strategic course .
during bonds , yields appear to change the direction once the first increase / decrease in the cycle .
at the end of the increased cycle the bond yields immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in the interest rates will result in the slow@@ down , allowing yields between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a turn of the curve .
high @-@ rate bonds often bring better income in such a climate even though &quot; we are still careful to expect higher income , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analyst at Schw@@ ab said in an analysis .
it is interesting , Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beside the strength of the dollar and the down@@ turn of inflation forecasts , there are some signs that the market has adapted to more str@@ ingent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest are increased , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending ten@@ tion have expanded , and the volume of vol@@ atility became increased - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed has intensi@@ fied its strategy .
in large and whole , businesses that are un@@ winding the greater part of their business activity in the U.S. will benefit from interest rates and make local products more attractive .
multinational corporations with high debts will be worse , as a rising dollar is making its products on the global market more expensive and also financing its debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stocks tend to react very positively , three months after initial interest rate adver@@ tise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sachs analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have out@@ done an average total of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate income in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low vol@@ atility in their shares , also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a great problem .
company with a high proportion of flexible rates will lose most , Gold@@ man said .
outside of pure shares , consumers will also benefit from increasing profit .
spar@@ er might see profits through higher income , even if experts are in different opinion how quickly this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Parliamentary Managing Director Andrew B@@ ingham
the conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the broad@@ caster for his &quot; stup@@ idity &quot;
he argued that he is increasingly important from commercial Riv@@ al .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
parliamentary colleague Dam@@ ien Collins were enth@@ used the program The Voice to and said that this was not an original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; wi@@ dens to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does something which do not do the broad@@ caster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives of Andrew B@@ ingham said to the BBC Bos@@ ses that the public radio broad@@ caster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; verd@@ um@@ me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly not more of its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; dig@@ ging &quot; - but it seems to turn up to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards , which began last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which began last year , appear to be The Br@@ its just under a different name .
so , if you are trying to do something else - these are two spont@@ aneously mentioned examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Music rejected the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of his commercial competition when it comes to live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 I &apos;m not going to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and to give the commitment of Radio 3 , to find new music and place new works in order , I really think about it , &quot; he said .
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that har@@ dening was to engage in getting the audience when it did this in the past , because the British are less about classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which , during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport , was under fire to enter the commercial rival on the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Collins asked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by Dutch producers of Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million pounds .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show was produced with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge &quot; on special BBC fashion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when it &apos;s the next time a entertainment series star@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order of further series of The Voice in the future , or to spend the money of the promot@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased by the slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000 .
online sales strengthened three years ago by using cell phones to shopping
experts believe that Black Friday bra@@ ked the issues in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping was bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have transformed themselves into favor@@ ited cities .
however , experts say that there are now indications that online sales stagn@@ ate , after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase from the previous year .
experts say there is signs that online sales stagn@@ ate , after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at growth rates for previous years and back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , Editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales complex The Guardian .
he declared that the online sales continued three years ago when the buyer started to engage with their cell phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now it comm@@ utes itself , and we may want to see that growth was reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for leaving sales .
experts believe that buyer will keep their purchases from this event , which will take place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers were around their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer sites threw away .
experts believe Black Friday in which the buyer could with@@ stand the buyer for bar@@ gain , purch@@ aser might bear up .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 spending is issued slightly more than £ 1 online .
in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of the purchases now is carried out on web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buying clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner circle .
Muslims , buried in Mec@@ ca near the accident of Crane - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried out by Muslims in the first bur@@ dens of Mec@@ ca by the streets .
Saudi Arabia aims to reduce the collapse of the giant Saudi Bin Laden group .
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collapsed
hundreds of Muslims were gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury those killed , when a crane collapsed in the Mek@@ ong Grand mosque .
dream filled , largely dressed in white , the distance to gra@@ p@@ ate their respect , when the first of the dead arrived their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ed@@ em cemetery .
the funeral proc@@ ession was passed by the Holy Site , where only days ago a building crane passed through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the bed @-@ ends .
the bodies were released for the bur@@ ial , when the Saudi King over the construction company of the family bin Laden due to the catastrophe which had also hang@@ ed 3@@ 94 injured .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 bet@@ ans killed , when a crane collapsed by the Great Central Mal@@ ch@@ ee Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead is Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to the crane collapsed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was his parents in the Great Mos@@ que with his parents .
Saudi city &apos;s official plans have already said that it will continue to travel to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continues to go to town .
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group had not said the arm of the crane to stand up when he was not used .
a Arabic version of the decree issued by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the agency &apos;s English @-@ language Service Agency did not report this detail , but said that the company &apos;s guidance are forbidden abroad .
in the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man was praised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that pl@@ ung@@ ed into a courtyard of the big mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims fle@@ eing from the H@@ add@@ sch , which takes place later this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not have statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representative were not available for comments .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also referred the group because of not current security measures and because it does not cooperate with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cranes surround the Mek@@ kas &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building that is managed by the Bin Laden group .
the family bin Laden has been connected with the Herr@@ scher@@ Family of Saudi Arabia and takes over bigger construction projects .
the mort@@ al leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a tr@@ ink@@ able son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , who is required at least once in a life of each healthy purpose .
officials said 158 people stay hospital .
government representatives announced that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to pay for members of the killed persons and the same sum to permanent injuries .
other di@@ stortion is half this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss is saying that the time of cheap Eastern European ar@@ tis@@ ans is over
British are increasingly employed professionals , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled workers in Eastern Europe has increased growth behind
this means that there are 200 new Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which aim at ar@@ tis@@ ans , are re@@ opened
at the same time , the King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales points nationwide
by Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Britain p@@ ushes their h@@ amm@@ ers and pain@@ t@@ brush in favor of the use of qualified medical professional tra@@ des@@ people working in their home .
if you are sk@@ ill@@ fully convers@@ ing with a hammer or a brush to design walls , you seem to be a minority .
because British are increasingly busy crafts@@ man to perform DIY jobs in their houses , so the company &apos;s boss behind B &amp; Q .
Véronique Lau@@ ry , new director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the tree stum@@ bling chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe , the services to low prices have meanwhile over@@ hau@@ led .
this is why King@@ fis@@ her is planning to open 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , dedicated to tra@@ des@@ people and close to 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions taken in the shop will be taken by women .
at the moment , men were silent in men &apos;s staff .
she said it is necessary to represent the growing demo@@ graphic trends that are more female single @-@ households that are more re@@ plac@@ ements than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works for a majority of men in our branches .
we must move this stronger into equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um .
in principle , half of our clients consists of women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in decision process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 index listed among leading companies , has also disman@@ tled their top team to reflect a equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
the King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies almost 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for the Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year earnings and sales after the group ow@@ ered the cost of re@@ aring the shops .
because of the trends King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials from a@@ I / DO@@ B due to un@@ faithful court
at the State Court of Kl@@ agen@@ furt , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball player &quot; a@@ I / DO@@ B have to be responsible for un@@ faith@@ fully and del@@ u@@ c@@ ation .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them had been indicted for abuse .
he was acquitted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused was cryst@@ alli@@ zed out in 2006 to 2011 , that the def@@ endants were able to disp@@ ose of agreements on which they were able to disp@@ ose to their functions .
amounts to the damage with approximately 400.000 euros .
the sports function@@ aries are also charged with financial off@@ ences .
this fact was the chairman of the opening ens@@ ats , Judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in , was born .
it should be negotiated a later date .
for the accus@@ ation of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the Defence presented that there was no contribution to the association at any time .
the sports function@@ aries had been mis@@ calculated and the Sport@@ club had been operating for them from 1982 to 2011 and had invested a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the Passi@@ va amounted to some 600@@ ,000 shots in 2001 ( about 4@@ 4,000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we stood before the situation : do we run the club further or un@@ lock it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the bre@@ ach of the tax adv@@ ices of the financial am@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he decided to complete this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have shot down money , laid down our life insurance in the Bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in cash . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the association has been agreed : you can manage the money free , there must be no debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the allow@@ ance of allow@@ ance of allow@@ ance was decre@@ ed retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , a proportion of allow@@ ances had not been changed only years later , namely from 2003 , when an increase was paid out on the account .
therefore , l@@ ump and not detailed bookings seemed to be explained , the former representative of the former Ob@@ mann discussed the processes .
accounts and ob@@ ooks managed the two def@@ endants in common , said the second accused .
why the withdrawal of the club was not described in detail , she asked the judge .
the Association is not interested in detail in finance department , it was important only to debt recovery , so the answer .
in 2011 , against which a major investigation began in the case of ten@@ dering , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euro was transferred to the club account .
these were resi@@ due , they proclaimed the def@@ endants .
the securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endants , and according to whose testimony was not known .
&quot; why ? &quot; he wanted to know the judge .
the respon@@ dent did not answer for a long time .
he then said that he believed that this was the best for the society .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have knew anything of that money , the prosecutor declared in the room .
the co@@ coon had been informed , he justi@@ fies the function@@ ary .
this transfer was form@@ ulated as a &quot; compensation . &quot;
why to claim damage ? , judges and state attor@@ ney wanted to know .
the first accused declared that he did not agree with this formulation because the association was never made any damage .
but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; With him are all of you from the tailor . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal counsel ? , &quot; he asked .
in addition , the function@@ ary said that he had never related a cent salary which calcul@@ ates only mileage and di@@ ets .
he added the club 1,000 euros a month to the club , but the actual effort was much higher than he added .
exact documents for the early years could not point the def@@ endants .
these men , according to an operating test , had been assessed all as a correct register , has no longer been kept , explained them .
Mil@@ estones also included the second accused .
all the hab@@ itations are settled in cash , so he must go to Blei@@ burg from his place where he must lead to Blei@@ burg , and explained in his statement .
the trial will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .

the decision on interest rates for the US @-@ bank@@ note bench
the world is watched by the US @-@ bank@@ note on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were interviewed by Reuters , found that a little more than half of the fact that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer , and the interest rate at this current rate is from 0 - 0,@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event , because it is seven years ago since the F@@ ed interest rate is set to NULL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a major central bank may leave the zero section and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , Head of Employ@@ ees at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is based on a relatively good performance level , trillion dollars is added to the balance and generate just one low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed does not ignore the less rocky view on global conditions .
it warned the markets to rise up on an increase , but the signs suggest that the chances are good against such a step .
the decision should be announced at 8@@ pm ME@@ Z on Thursday
death scra@@ per at the Delta State University left sorry
after shooting and killing his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot his counter@@ parts later on the day - Sh@@ annon cleared a note to tell him that he was &quot; sorry &quot; of the first murder and wanted to make it un@@ checked , &quot; stated public authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that lamb , lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University , calling the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , He shot up and kill someone .
lamb , the staff of the emergency call , said that police officers have to send polic@@ emen at his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I made my wife last night , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give him .
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy P@@ ren@@ tic@@ s , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted it , I could reverse it .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , some 300 miles to Delta State University where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor in history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police officers moved him .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b imag@@ inations . &quot;
in spite of reports on Monday , the Lamb believed that P@@ ren@@ tic@@ on also had a relationship with Schmidt , said public authorities on Tuesday to give it no evidence , no evidence of a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
P@@ ren@@ tic@@ i was given by Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had been married for about seven years , as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and P@@ ren@@ tic@@ i would have a daughter who is 19 and was &quot; destroyed &quot; the ground . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said P@@ ren@@ tic@@ es were her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ren@@ tic@@ i worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les that was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of P@@ ren@@ tic@@ i .
Know@@ les said that P@@ ren@@ tic@@ es , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met himself from lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les
the police said , lamb had invited relatives to a certain date on Monday to tell them , &quot; he didn &apos;t go into prison . &quot;
when police officers led him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , he navig@@ ated his car to the side , fled towards foot , ran to the forest and killing himself with a shot .
lamb received a PhD in spring 2015 from the Delta State University how his lifetime was on the university &apos;s website .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group around

Lufthansa builds up its company structure and evalu@@ ates cheap ro@@ uting .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is to generate around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syn@@ ergi@@ es , the airline shared the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no management board for passenger business in the future .
the cheap line Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as quite as possible as possible .
in the board team leader Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , who will be responsible for being responsible for Eu@@ rosci@@ ings in future .
with the new position , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of eu@@ rov@@ ings with which the group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
so far , the organization of the 120 &quot; 000 employees was complex .
the airlines operated under the roof of the Air@@ line Group , which represents the three @-@ quarter annual turnover of € 30 billion .

the hat@@ ch of Manchester United can &apos;t play for double Fra@@ ktur due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered by the Champions League defeat at Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven a double fac@@ ture of his right b@@ ale .
while this left the left outside , he brought him weeping and exclu@@ de it for at least six months from playing , Louis van G@@ aal does not give up the hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season .
the injury was caused by a hop@@ eless attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V region .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van G@@ aal said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double bed fra@@ ction and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later , and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy that comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then fantastic , and then happens .
in the dressing room he had a oxygen mask .
he was crying .
I &apos;m not a doctor but if you have a double c@@ ture , then takes the six months , and he will not play in the group stage .
I hope he can play this season back again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a red card and the hanging of a El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , does not pun@@ ish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van G@@ aal projected that the Italian arbit@@ er had been mist@@ aken .
they can judge for themselves , if I say a penalty and one red card was due .
it was a very serious assault with both legs .
a Twe@@ et at Sha@@ ws account had : &quot; thank you all for your news . words can not describe how kap@@ ut I am , my path to recovery begins now , I &apos;m getting stronger again . &quot;
referring to : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w when the PS@@ V defeat .
with European Championship in France , the UK @-@ def@@ ender has an additional incen@@ tive to recover during the coming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; it is very mal@@ icious . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about this .
it is never the purpose of our players to hurt another opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break @-@ in when Mexico had played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and when you hear that it is a very hur@@ l injury , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coc@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in another direction so that it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad here . I am so sorry for that .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - based on a F@@ oul@@ ash by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not last long until you know it almost .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re maybe David Cameron .
when he has been asked by a supplier of child care systems , his favourite child@@ rens book decided , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult election , Cameron writes in a message on the website of super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , as it always seems to have an image or message we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and well , except that the next paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the action of the book , instead added a content release of the 2012 movie that added the new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the middle of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ an @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , to see the heart of Audrey , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads let us read . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el , and who died in 1991 , was completely unknown .
as if that was not a suspect correctly , the text of Cameron displayed on the website of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , is something artificial , and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
even though he is admitted to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely to put the action of the book as little familiar . here , a un@@ named boy , like the local environment , through the protests of the well @-@ called Lor@@ ax , a tow@@ ing , car@@ eless nature , &quot; which is spoken in the name of the trees , &quot; has been rav@@ aged .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read the Lor@@ ax for 20 times a child .
a down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come from the Cam@@ er@@ ons Ele@@ ction Office .
Super@@ camps confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ on staff was delivered , but did not give any further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was threatened with the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult .
to avoid Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one randomly selected the cad@@ re , the England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series was not on my card .
I would not exclu@@ de a reverse victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Page is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good Sp@@ in players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the common spirit is strong ; they will carry no fri@@ es from 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as Sp@@ in @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even when he represents an unknown size on a test plane , an option is for the attack .
this report related news : Adam Ly@@ th breaks out from the England @-@ test @-@ cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is hard to give me as chief trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , to analyse hard .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks in difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that te@@ amm@@ ers are aimed at results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I said this - players are their very best chosen ones .
a long time ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny .
when hopefully points out for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not give such good achievements , and that surprised me not ; he is primarily an team man .
the question of how much time a test schl@@ mann gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven chances - including Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton took on nine .
only Comp@@ to@@ on got the chance to play home and reverse .
the only accus@@ ation that you can rise was that England first depos@@ ited in the Caribbean at first - when Ly@@ th was in high form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he is a striking that I sho@@ ve .
he is an X factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in early during this season when he reached 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must receive at least the same chances as those in front of him , but this depends on the team &apos;s commitment to the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of leaving Mo@@ as next Cook would suggest what would get an extra Sp@@ in Bow@@ ler and got four Qu@@ ik@@ es , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a b@@ ats@@ man can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has shown that he is a devil &apos;s devil &apos;s cri@@ cket player .
Mo@@ een perhaps did not get his job to his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my earlier team mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined the Op@@ ener in 2001 .
he did gain three hundred measures immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner and in my limited way he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on average 31 with the bats and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a P@@ unt , but there is no great number of backup spreads , who raise their hands and the train@@ ers have decided upon youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made a couple of clever ad@@ ditions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ a , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master@@ piece .
he is one of the nic@@ est not@@ ices of the game , which will bring a lot of experience , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use to the setup .
I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player , or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can fresh fresh winds in the changing room , even if the messages are con@@ form@@ ulated with the previous song .
coll@@ age &apos;s team mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break in Australia and I have no problem with that .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team mates will not define the schedule .
and you have to think that , as in the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in mind .

the Europeans know how to use the Fle@@ et Street to its expense , and which EU scep@@ tics were the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press@@ way , but they hadn &apos;t been to our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ un@@ ists , who made themselves a name as an &quot; EU @-@ To@@ ad ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels @-@ correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ ies years .

in fact , militia was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans when Bl@@ air resi@@ sted himself , because Bl@@ air had turned the principle over the non @-@ approved Constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 to open a back@@ door .

it is what Hil@@ ary , &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week , when the sc@@ ou@@ ting fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns was a bad idea as the inc@@ eption of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell .
it rec@@ alled me about the 70 @-@ year @-@ old , as his old father tried to be an effort to be loyal to his Labour cabinet @-@ mate , without going too far and to lose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys combat was even more attractive .
but to fight , &quot; to stay &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ i &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his co@@ h@@ ers and dep@@ u@@ ties according to all reports on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to conv@@ ey - remember that he even has touched me - news discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all things in the stru@@ del of social media , a breeding place of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it is true to give Cameron a free ticket for Europe , which allowed him to keep lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ end@@ ent campaign to what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said it .

experts critic@@ ise the report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that E @-@ cigarettes are less harmful as smoking came from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) included Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ising the public health advoc@@ ates by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
P@@ he released the &quot; Grund@@ gesetz &quot; report last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resistance of the data and questioned the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
as an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month , the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily sustained basis &quot; applied to the P@@ he its most important conclusion .
two more researchers are writing in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; on stone or sand are built . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the claim that &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful as smoking , based on a detailed audit of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement is made up of a single sitting of 12 people who were invited to develop a model for a multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) in order to lead their opinions on the damages of various nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ hal@@ ved products ; the results of the meeting were consolidated in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing directors had previously received by British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared that funds from an e @-@ cigarettes producer , but not the financing , which he should have received after reports from the tobacco enterprise Philip Morris International , added her .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the gre@@ ats are not shipped , but also include several popular E @-@ cigarettes , some of which have a sector funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco supervision of P@@ he participated in the meeting .
the research group of the Group &quot; conf@@ essed that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products on most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; there is no proof that e @-@ cigarettes have been as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well@@ being at P@@ he said that it had previously been respon@@ ding to the claims of BM@@ J .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long rou@@ gh@@ ter dies on his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes in comparison are small , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has given the laws to the public to the public about what is proving , and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80.000 people are dying per year in a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health Care system two billion pounds per year .
due to the clear evidence of current evidence that E @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of the damage caused by smoking causes , we are fulfilling our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop using programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival &quot; would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows such as Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting service should be used only in order to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast through other UK stations .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for telling them publicly @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ disputed time@@ frames on the most popular shows of their rival and sen@@ ders like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC head director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said , that he tried to get into contact with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are assigned , or send them that were also clearly shown by non @-@ subsi@@ dised rival , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communic@@ ations Committee under the BBC &apos;s future .
if you don &apos;t want to keep the radio fee , which do not hold a good idea in mid @-@ term or long @-@ term , you should at least make your production on programs that others do not make or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve a wide support for the future .
the idea that nobody else would show it is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs are financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another program ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm .
I stri@@ ve to see how this is to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would even lower the BBC .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for the series , who led the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC will be to the hunt for reviews &apos; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts , which was the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , held in Edinburgh in 2003 , proposed that the BBC shows that the BBC shows as East@@ En@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal nom@@ usi@@ ans should go to BB@@ C4 , but they do not measure their tasks , and they can argue if they have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ary missions to justify decl@@ aring up for 4 billions of radio fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have seen all of these ob@@ sc@@ outs . &quot;
they put them into a time window , in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the broadcasting service Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ ent system in terms of conditions who can obtain the best value . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you think we all think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for those who have a lot of money for the 150 £ an amount of money , ask me whether that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check out &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said , just a little from BBC production would now officially classified as education - he said that there were 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio ; and it should take part in the publicly @-@ legal TV transm@@ itters in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the question of the Partner@@ ships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only a hand@@ ful of TV will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ caster alli@@ ances in order to make everything online available .
&apos;@@ son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can ste@@ er brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with impul@@ sive impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems , that can be controlled by ra@@ fts of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they have with sound impul@@ ses , which have at high frequencies for the hearing of the human hearing , in order to be radi@@ ated radi@@ ated .
impul@@ ses are working through the power of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to wear the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m channels that react to ultrasound shafts .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms , the power of a new method , called Son@@ or@@ om@@ tics , can be used in the ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stim@@ ulation , an inv@@ ari@@ ve procedure which gives electrical impul@@ ses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
as a rule , F@@ aden@@ worms react in ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani realized that they were doing it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scop@@ ic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , intensi@@ fy the ultrasound waves , that enter into the worms .
the ampli@@ fication ultrasound shafts appear on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms .
the sound waves strike the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells , which they are allocated , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ asonic @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ onen can carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels .
when cutting ultrasound on the changed creatures , the sound waves are intensi@@ fied by the micro bubbles and transferred to worms , where they have changed the changed motor @-@ ons .
the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetic diagnostics , a ground@@ breaking tool , the scientists enables neur@@ ons with imp@@ ul@@ ses of light and en@@ force .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics might have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that has to come down on a optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound fi@@ del@@ ine tissue has to be hin@@ dered and can be sent into the brain on top of the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that using gen@@ therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical attitude for certain neurological treatment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

the cheerful voice and the carto@@ ons leave no doubt that this ad was produced for the world &apos;s largest criminal trade fair , which was produced by Am@@ nesty International to provide the read@@ iness of the British government into the spotlight , guns on the re@@ pres@@ sive regime on the Defence and Security Equipment International Jam@@ bo@@ ree in the Excel Centre in London &apos;s Dock@@ lands .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are visible on bus stations and in the subway trains , and that require a second glance .
&quot; important announcement : drive from 15 to 18 September with D@@ LR ? &quot; ( DO@@ C@@ KL@@ AN@@ DS Light Railway ) , one reads in the font types of the London Underground and the hall@@ marks of the D@@ LR line which conver@@ ts to the image of a P@@ anz@@ ers .

V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt Le@@ ver was astonished about the silence , which ruled around the advertising for the arms trade - and thought : &quot; give them the campaign they attempt to avoid . &quot;
they played with the invention of a more realistic setting , but &quot; gl@@ ul@@ ating with bright colours and animation will remain stronger . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us to shar@@ pen the awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty .
what we need now is an adv@@ ancing of the British Government and the guarantee that fol@@ ks should not be tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .

eight gold rules for life in student residence
eleven years ago I moved to a student dormit@@ ory ( 19 @-@ year @-@ old ) , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the bent smile of those which I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , leng@@ thy complaints about others .
most of all I have learned is disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the train in student residence ranges from slightly ner@@ ven@@ ous up to an absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to ch@@ att@@ ing : people tell whence you come from where to stand with Cor@@ by@@ n and why you , &quot; frank@@ ly , Mar@@ m@@ ite doesn &apos;t love to love , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find out the people that you like in contrast to those who would not speak even if your l@@ ashes were in fire and this fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave .
rooms of people often turn in drinks recipes , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people wear and wear their under@@ wear .
this is related : remember not to start at the university with a relationship
intro@@ vert a rough handling at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but there are a lot of student residence , a room @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble@@ bee culture , which is friendly and soci@@ ally and to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who is trying to rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship continued , but you must go away so that I hold the energy back that I used for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from soci@@ ability - and send it to him an SMS instead .
speaking of kno@@ b : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that an un@@ folded door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close through B@@ aking .
as you start the Uni at the cli@@ max of the back @-@ mania , the Klo@@ p is present on the doors of people to imagine with a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es , less wei@@ rd as the welcome of the 1950 @-@ ies &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have something to give you . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
tasty home @-@ made treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates are committed to enter@@ tain themselves and will associate your face with a tasty surprise at the end .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly combined cl@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat , make people sleeping , when you drop anchor .
trying to steal food is a common crime in student residence .
of course the ho@@ of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of Mil@@ k for your tea ?
check with the milk owner .
chances are good , that they say self @-@ served themselves , even if they are boiling in the inner .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it balanced as my fellow country@@ men who added a washing powder to her milk to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you shouldn &apos;t make any noise , people from sleep or doing business .
it is not only about being a decent man , but that in the sense of wit@@ ness@@ ing , people belong to the people who sit in the glass .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbours if there was something to ask them , drum &amp; bass at home , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an examination in the morning .
they acted upon it with even more loud music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , they left their neighbours together again two hours before they left their own music , shut down her door and went to her three @-@ hour test .
would it not be romantic if your sp@@ ouse would acci@@ dentally move into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it would not be ab@@ ys@@ ul@@ sive , embarrass@@ ment , if you have a contribut@@ or for your future sp@@ ouse , join them again , and will need to see each day and perhaps to see how they re@@ treats all common friends ?
of course , the heart is its own way - but if a hot co @-@ dw@@ eller is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse , try at least to in@@ duce a bit of reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has its keys in his un@@ closed room has allowed the border between an ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing than it seems .
a good battle is funny , but it takes just moments until it will bo@@ omer@@ ang for the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but you never fails to any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
shut down your door , and put their keys into a glass of water , which you then place in the freezer - but don &apos;t t@@ ack@@ ers your poss@@ essions at the ceiling no more than twice .
town@@ houses for refugees , people @-@ making , Ger@@ ing@@ thick@@ ener
the real estate company Markus G@@ ild@@ ner build houses in the middle of the Eck@@ ental terra@@ ced houses for people who have not much money .
so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need residential area , but also the only concer@@ ting mother and the poor comp@@ ener . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how you can still build and build well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the apartment market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly the living room can be created : it builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will push for the apartment market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the massive accommodation in containers or turn@@ tables have no sustainability .
for people remain in a great part here .
in view of the refugee meal we also need sufficient housing over the next decades .
a very ban@@ qu@@ ered , three @-@ storey town@@ house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town@@ house needs the least place .
it facil@@ it@@ ates the integration .
that is different , if people under@@ going people in hab@@ itation .
each of the six houses , which are being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for each of four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees say , it &apos;s peace , I go back .
then , the houses can be re@@ arranged according to the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without property .
that is ob@@ struc@@ tible .
the construction lasts for six months .
that is fair .
did the building regulations make their plans complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I got under construction properly to my project .
it is especially difficult for the dro@@ pping Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sh@@ value special construction and set @-@ up .
cre@@ epy .
it is still sub@@ mitting , who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in cities is missing the space .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the natives react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who were accused of creating luxury for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not right .
but do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate the cont@@ ention for affordable apartments ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : it &apos;s true : we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but were built in luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living room .
not only refugees , but also the only mothers &apos; mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ thick@@ ener .
I show how you can still build and build well today .
that is why it works .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system if Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by entering the setting app to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , telephone gives you the option to download and then to install .
some have encountered problems after installation , because they receive an error message that means the &quot; software up@@ dating is missing . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the rush returned or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
that may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to do this through the ver@@ dic@@ ation of updates . likewise , it will be easier to delete this when you install a special tool , to install apps and then re @-@ install when the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to make sure your mobile phone is charged while up@@ dating , or is near a charging device , so the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple has not allow the update as the phone might be continued on half way , and it could lead to a demo@@ lition of updates .

G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Judge 1 . class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation made by Alfred Klein .
therefore , it is possible to include chess players , who cannot afford the membership fee .
youth work and talent search should also be driven forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wants the member of the club &apos;s club and friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an expression of its solidarity with the cour@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Al@@ ten@@ ds Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the clo@@ ak of the social inc@@ it@@ ement and opened a new plant in Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg .
besides consultations you can also participate in courses there .
the Sozial@@ stiftung comes down from the mountain into the city center .
more precisely , the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Platz .
there was recently opened a new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro .
here , next to the shopping market , we will receive sen@@ iors and advice information on issues such as health insurance or health insurance services .
for years , we have been working with our out@@ patient care service that often can be left care @-@ depend@@ ant .
there are countless questions here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither rarely many benefits of insur@@ ers are not accepted , because the complexity of insur@@ moun@@ ts cannot be understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new household manufacturer J@@ utta Wei@@ g@@ and , which is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Civil Hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ deus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides the consulting services , the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro is offering prevention , health care and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , you can use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment .
the accommodations of the senior centres and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in the ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis represents prevention , pensions , and rehabilitation .
&quot; the retirement center for care and care , &quot; Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the reason for opening the new tourist office in the city center see both business leaders particularly in demo@@ graphic change .
for that , a good central infrastructure in the individual neighbor@@ hoods of Bam@@ berg is essential in the future .
besides , so under@@ scored Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) at the inauguration ceremony , the ro@@ o@@ at office also dedic@@ ates itself to the club &apos;s arrangement at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite for a regular soci@@ able support . &quot;
thus , the Sozial@@ stiftung re@@ tains a great contribution that sen@@ iors can as much as independent and good in their intimate environment .
the source office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tu@@ es@@ days and Thurs@@ days from 16 : 00 to 12 : 00 and Saturdays from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 .

men beat on 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 a.m. , three young men were walking distance of Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one out of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afghan , followed after information by the police at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him to wait .
at this point , the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
the fuel station also took place on the grounds of the petrol station .
one of those men scre@@ amed the young man and hit his face with his fist .
the victim was a nose syndrome and ha@@ em@@ at@@ ched strongly out of the nose .
when his two friends were meeting @-@ meeting and comp@@ eted on the bats , he initially suffered from his victims .
from his friends , the last young man was brought home .
the off@@ ender ste@@ ered the group with a passenger car up to its apartment and drove several times over there .
when you saw the car no longer , the injured one went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was once again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male .
using a striking mechanism , one tested the victim &apos;s face and the th@@ igh@@ s of the victim .
the last had to be supervised by medical care in a hospital .
so far only one vag@@ ue activity before .
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters tall .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice fel@@ lows and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ cher@@ ausen .
in addition , Sam@@ t@@ ey &apos;s mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , managed by the Jama@@ at U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ fs Herman Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are pleased .
in many places on the country there are doctors - As@@ endorf . fortunately , Dr. Frank Müller takes over office in practice .
during prehistoric rock you retired , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still studying its successor in the next few months , with half a place to his side .
after a renovation project , Müller opened the practice on 12 October until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros into the rooms at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy for the first glance at the years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently completed her medical training at the Ver@@ te hospital , and also wants to climb into practice this year .
&quot; we always had in mind that the Mü@@ llers are going to fit into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ is@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; when I was ready , I simply called it . &quot;
the Mess@@ ner has liked the idea in future to pursue its own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and the permanent contact to patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to know and assist the families of the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he will see his own boss too .
and so you agree , the Mü@@ llers bought the house with practice .
they will continue to stay in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
Frank Müller became the tw@@ o@@ fold family father Frank Müller , who followed several stages of medical surg@@ eries as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ay@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ ch@@ â@@ tel .
he currently works as a Consult@@ ant in Sul@@ ay@@ ingen , in addition he was appointed as a Senior Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is committed to volunteer work on DR@@ K @-@ Read@@ iness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19 , practice for the new boss is prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ cher@@ ausen has worked as a doctor , his wife origin@@ ates in Ur@@ sel ( an intern@@ ist ) on Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Mü@@ llers , both of them , want to settle in car@@ in@@ arians .
&quot; the final os@@ copy came out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the conversion the spaces will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations and long @-@ term and load @-@ up ment@@ ers , and need a speaker room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the m@@ iller received a grant from a total of 50@@ 000 euros in the scope of a funding program of the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality fee ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses Mrs Bor@@ mann &apos;s mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some 2,000 patients come to the practice of Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l each quarter to the practice &apos;s practice , in the North @-@ German average @-@ practice it is about 500 .
there is also another medical practice in As@@ endorf .
as a positive side effect of practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains at the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ er in As@@ endorf .
if no successor had found , she would have gone .
who visited Mü@@ llers of consultations , inci@@ dentally , in familiar faces : the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power have been taken over by the rim .
with their farewell to As@@ endorf an era , the medical profession is practic@@ ed for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning , we only had two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel , rock@@ ing , and gr@@ asp@@ ing .
a little sad@@ ness after the long time already .
&quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients safely even often , &quot; says the boarding .
her husband is comple@@ mented : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pushed me out of gardening , but now it could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the couple has two grand@@ children and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are driven out on our southern border , &quot; said Minister , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this side .
as before , it is clear that everyone who wants to ask for an asylum application , can of course be &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; of course .
the care and safety of people stand in the fore@@ ground .
but it is also clear that it takes clear signals , &quot; said the Minister .
people need to know that we don &apos;t accept lim@@ it@@ less migrants flows , nor beyond the Austr@@ o @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia has denied
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to continue travelling to Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany and to establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
thus , the Minister of the Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ k@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not exist .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors was &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - particularly to Hungary .
the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled by the Schengen area .
as the Minister pointed out , Sloven@@ ians did not want to profit its borders for refugees but not .
&quot; every EU member must fill its comm@@ itments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; Gy@@ ör@@ head T@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to escape in the night hours on Tuesday to devi@@ ate in East @-@ Croatian at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in order to ev@@ ade the registration .
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the nearby maize fields .
according to local media , since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles continued to meet new refugees with new refugees .
it acts mainly to Syrians and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children .
also emergency services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with some 4,000 refugees , Minister of the Interior , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
the buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo would also be brought to the Hungarian border from Pre@@ se@@ vo , who had previously managed to mig@@ rate migrants to the Hungarian border , direc@@ ting Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade denied it , however , that it is possible to sm@@ ite certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor want to do this , &quot; he named it .
according to media reports , a first bus took place in the morning of around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d during the day , further buses were expected .
on Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were on the road to the Maced@@ onian border by Serbia , 500 kilometers away from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary had made us , so the police said that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could happen , in fact , for ob@@ servers already predicted shift from the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister of Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously pointed out that his country had prepared for the fall of a strong inf@@ est@@ rogen with refugees for possible exceptional circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; details he did not name , but he pointed out that Croatia is a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it controls strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have been consistently aware of what concerns the standard border controls .
on this Serbian side are stuck behind the Hungarian Gren@@ zz@@ au@@ n to keep about 300 fu@@ gi@@ tives .
according to reports of media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to Hungarian authorities , the two border processes , Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel further to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister of Interior N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic tried to calm on Wednesday morning at a local head@@ light : he hold the debates about Alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature death .
at the moment , there would not be very high refugee figures .
one could not say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers rates migrants - dangerous - Alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute the refugees benef@@ ited through Croatia , where alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border region there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , there are still no more clean mine@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team was sent from the mine@@ fields in the border region .

F@@ ed@@ Ex results mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the supply @-@ giving increased its profit to a year due to the we@@ aker demand for cargo services and higher costs in its fuel transport services .
the company also said that she plans to hire some 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers on holiday .
at this point in the last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to change 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday time .
the share fell about 2.5 percent in the Pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. Announ@@ ces a gain of $ 10.@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ in the business year , which ends in the next May , 20 cents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected from a survey of a Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes in spite of the price increases , which will average 4.9 percent and will be effective on January 4 and , despite the higher adverse weather conditions , of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said that it nonetheless is expecting that the result is due to cost reduction , higher income , and for growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides &quot; solid yields , considering the weakness of expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global commerce , which is considered . &quot;
the plans for the holiday employment have been announced a day later as the official UPS had to hire 9@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour force , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex was $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve by Z@@ acks Investment Research asked analysts predicted .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion dollars .
six of the analysts asked the expected $ 12,@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex showed a decline in international priority shipping to stagn@@ ate sales in its unit Express Shipping
but the boom in online shopping has raised its results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
sales increased by 29 percent in the last quarter , but the operating result was almost flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher income due to higher prices , while the result for higher workers in the cargo sector decreased .
at Pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares rose by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 per cent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed 11 percent of loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
waiting for the most expected conference in the year &apos;s Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists two days sitting this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ ony @-@ table to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift the lead for the first time since almost a decade .
dro@@ pping over them at an end of the dedicated , two @-@ story Se@@ asons are a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ella and their colleagues should set the nation &apos;s economic interests before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold order from Congress : maxim@@ ize US occupation and prices keep it stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that it is an un@@ written third hand : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision to predi@@ ct them to predi@@ ct them . it is announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from an unprecedented growth rate by close to zero @-@ term interest rate by the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows in solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il could join the global financial markets the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representative , this volume increases by the interest rate of interest for federal bonds - and is it only by one @-@ quarter percentage point .
&quot; apparently the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important thing to observe what they are observed , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , head of economics at the Mak@@ ers company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text , the interest rate is not increasing , increased uncertainty on the global market is sufficient to justify decl@@ ining , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is un@@ stable itself to the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists , recently reported by Bloomberg , have predicted a interest rate this week .
financial markets await , however , wait a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ an indicator , which shows a 30 % chance to increase .
this points to a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists are decl@@ ining their strike by promise that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial increased its average value of 22@@ 8.@@ 89 points or around 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed @-@ politics hosted the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ ski , Chief economist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t fall into panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a interest rate would rest the financial markets , because it would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would be removed .
still a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on a good way to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow deteri@@ oration of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
in spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen had said that , despite the condition of liber@@ als this year , it would be more economical that more economic progress would be an increase of the pro@@ positions .
although the creation of employment in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and close to levels that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases are shown signs of recovery .
and despite the inflation below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed @-@ Represent@@ ants reported that the main reason would be the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them due to tension in labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , boss of Pan@@ the@@ on .
but financial markets around the world agreed at the end of the last month after China had dev@@ al@@ u@@ ed its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial aver@@ ages fell by more than 16 % below its maximum level as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would imp@@ ly global growth .
this month has recovered slightly in this month , the Dow is now nearly 10 % below the h@@ ype from May .
for F@@ ed @-@ Represent@@ ants influence the market turbul@@ ence the complex calculation , when one should increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of Chinese economy would not have occurred in the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee in the US bank@@ note bench . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the grip .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data , which describe developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is none of the main issues of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in their decision @-@ making .
but in the end the world &apos;s monetary authorities became the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere note from the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could expand its monetary expansion &quot; tight , &quot; solved confusion about the globe .
in a world where markets and economies , are becoming increasingly inter@@ woven , can also be monitored by the F@@ ed representative , that they should not only consult the developments at other sites , but also advis@@ ing with other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more arts than science , &quot; Zac@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell said , head of the global strategy for asset management of the firm En@@ vest@@ oms Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked the month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ actions on financial market movements that are not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
h@@ ack@@ ers , voted unanim@@ ous member of the Federal Open Market Committee , set up for interest rate hike , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its leader to 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite a limited acknowle@@ d@@ gement of apparent effects on growth in the US . &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed Represent@@ ative made these cuts pers@@ ist .
the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market crash , Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England .
recent turbul@@ ence do not come near the level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to go into the situation in which they fear of a interest rate because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act will still contain the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until the change is changed , I don &apos;t think it should have time ahead .

Brazilian society Rio Grande supports food for healthy breast@@ feeding
the SP@@ RS Brazilian p@@ ic organization is trying to clari@@ fy women on this sho@@ cking way , how important good nutrition during the breast@@ feeding is . she does this with the presentation of images of babies that are painted to breasts , which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies provide all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
because of the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake was not the only di@@ ät@@ e@@ tical adaptation that mothers should take .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet regularly affects the genes of their babies and protects them from tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .

the planning for the long @-@ a@@ waited gymn@@ asi@@ um on the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds are step forward step forward : in the recent joint press , the construction paper was ra@@ ined without large discussions .
previously , the Board had decided to apply for a temporary &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; resp@@ ecting &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; of the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was for permission to be a special form in the roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ eful first and roof over &quot; is to be erected .
background the planning is the planned use of roof for solar plants : &quot; thereby we get a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; said Dr. Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
in the &quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; there was again for the roof of the roof , which is intended for energy reasons - differently than in the development plan - to be below ten degrees .
the volume of the hall is reduced significantly .
a &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the roof pitch is not &quot; exceptions &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der overhead is usually more restric@@ tive in the deliver@@ ance .
it is not a recur@@ ring project at the gym . &quot; we do not make a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the Gym at the sports centre is a communal project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
approximately 2.3 million euros are stored in the amount of costs .
grants are expected from the training and latitude .
in the next step of procedure , the building application for the 18 x 36 metre scale is now presented to the Council of the Council .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of the employees pull down by P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is what the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the district is mainly confirmed by Land@@ s@@ ine Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
however , a decision on this decision however will meet the Supervisory Board , and the decision on upcoming Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue working at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should move to fishermen and the continuing inland station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
in W@@ eil@@ heim the cow@@ or@@ kers cannot be offered a work@@ station in W@@ eil@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees are informed of their plans .
he has triggered the change from the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der who has only been medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now changed to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
when asked who will follow the succession , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into the game which was ready to take over as of October 1 , and to take action with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
in any event , for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means &quot; appreciation &quot; and an extension of the offer within the field of &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the internal station of gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
over the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the board of directors decided to agree both houses , until the next year , the former Hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ell@@ ation , which has still more than 35 beds , should finally be closed down in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after nearly 140 years .
until now , the county has planned this in 2018 , when the current renovation is completed at the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital .
Land@@ tra@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , which is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , represented rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Federal Council , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; I &apos;m closing . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several consider@@ ations .
at present there are present a short @-@ term care of car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the better thing could not happen to us but such an opportunity will come back again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer on the Qu@@ asi move to Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positively and very comprehen@@ sible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house , where fishermen , for over 30 years , worked as a chief physician , did not exist .
he has been asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) over the past few decades was continually threatened by closure , sections were closed , for example the surgery and Obst@@ et@@ rics .
the clearing of the Rhein @-@ Neckar lions are now tonight required at the mountain HC ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) .
the Bundesliga in the Bundesliga is indeed a clear favourite , due to the surveys .
during the last season , Bad@@ ener moved with the B@@ HC with a painful defeat and there have been a little cleaner .

refugees need housing : study warns of housing
the situation on the German home market is ten@@ se .
even more refugees seek a paid stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution of distribution on the German residential market have long since begun .
with the coming refugees and jobs in the EU , more people are pushing for a market that is now over@@ loaded in many major cities .
you compete with income tax citizens in order to reach the last affordable housing .
in order to cover demand for affordable housing , 400,000 units would have to be built up to 2020 .
at this result , a study was commissioned by the &quot; social housing . &quot;
for comparison , there are 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units in Germany this year .
14@@ 0.000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a first recording facility .
many encounter then on the home market and lined up in the long sn@@ akes before the rental apartments .
according to the Office of Statistics , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is , however , not only to rising people .
the study also makes significant inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ aries in housing policies for the past years .
Germany Red@@ thi@@ eves a housing deficit which is bigger from year to year .
at the moment , some 77@@ ,000 residential units are missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many voc@@ alists were living in major cities in WG @-@ rooms cities .
young adults stayed on the home market un@@ will@@ ingly longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in major cities , the number of square meters per capita has declined for the first time in recent years .
to solve this problem , the Alliance &quot; social housing &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
in doing so , new incen@@ tives are to stimul@@ ate its social housing construction .
thus , the F@@ under@@ expect@@ ant tax could be disp@@ osed of and the base tax for subsidi@@ zed flats are denied .
also , the Alliance provides attractive fiscal or smooth @-@ operation options .
the funding program for refugee information by the State Bank Kf@@ W now comes well in cities and communities .
a good week after the start was Monday evening , with 184 million euros , more than half of the roughly 300 million euros have been provided .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free funds : Croatia and Slovenia in the corridor .
after Hungary , there is no longer a passage , because more refugees opp@@ ose the way through Croatia .
Zagreb announces the journey through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia has to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia over the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked with the Slovenian interior minister , and when it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Home Secretary Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and already part of the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ Land Croatia is not a Schengen country .
after the expul@@ sion of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV broad@@ caster RTL .
Hungary had its border to refugees at the day before .
new laws created in force on the same day are extra@@ ordin@@ arily superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to make the refugees shift .
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic stated : &quot; they can travel and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot;
these people are there , women , children and men want to live and want to achieve something .
however , people who do not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the Serbian Border to the EU neighbour of Croatia in the morning .
most of the media reports die from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came from the bus as well as with Tax@@ es in the Serbian border town Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border the refugees do not encounter any Gren@@ zz@@ l@@ une .
the boar@@ der strips over other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine spatial plann@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , after the closure of the border , no longer refugees arrive after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police booked 3@@ 66 sk@@ ill@@ fully attacked .
just before the closing on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws stages the over@@ coming and damage of the Gren@@ zz@@ a@@ uns as a crime .
therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were introduced in the Sz@@ eg@@ ed Hungarian border .
the sentenced sentences up to five years and the deportation from the country .
according to the immigration rules , on Tuesday , a total of 94 asylum applications was accepted to the border of the &quot; Tran@@ se@@ ed@@ ay &quot; border , almost all of them - 93 - the most important R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
below the applicant be 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
in practice , however , nobody has given any view to granted asylum in Hungary .
in Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the di@@ stra@@ ked asylum seek@@ ers should be deported there .
before the &quot; Tran@@ sc@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke only a few hundred refugees were gathered .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke the workers began to cut off with it .
they collected the garbage , the tens of thousands of people left in the road@@ side during the past weeks .
the lat@@ tice were disman@@ tled , and one of the fires in the boundary was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express themselves to the goal of this building .
Austria reached a few fu@@ gi@@ tives following the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also reinforced its border controls .
according to government figures , the 20,000 migrants still took place in the country .
in Salzburg , 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Freil@@ assing , smaller groups of refugees came from refugees on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; may@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the border with &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge firm on Sunday with the living room , as suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany stopped the train with Austria on Sunday but ceased for them in W@@ ern@@ aum , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the st@@ ran@@ ded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
before that , we spent the un@@ trusted guests only once , with snack and beverages .
we have already said , we will bring them back to Pass@@ au with our car .
&quot; it was of course for us , &quot; as Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very grateful .
a man left it not to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stran@@ ded tractors were moved on Sunday night in W@@ els from ICE to a regional train in the direction of Pass@@ au , in order to follow it after the short notice , that the railway traffic was shut down to Germany , but even beyond the border .
but the regional train was placed in front of the inn , W@@ ern@@ stein at Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein is the cross @-@ border generally high on the course .
the bridge @-@ festival association with the Bavarian neighbours are soci@@ able on Sunday , day before a two @-@ circuit athl@@ ete , organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now calls for another Z@@ ig@@ las to us , is a logical result of a sacred politics :
instead of helping the moun@@ ts in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp to ensure Human@@ ity , our Federal Chancellor has put up high @-@ official and publicly ob@@ struc@@ ted the position of the Hungarian Government in the dun@@ gh@@ age of National Soci@@ alism .
bodies of these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confron@@ ted in the boundary regions with cha@@ otic states .
the poultry sites will also have to realize that the &quot; praised country , &quot; which she invited and welcome , is nothing more than another refugee camp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a major challenge , in view of the continued refugees and the approaching winter , making decent conditions for protection of protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be one more major - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the quest for 35@@ ,000 Mountain@@ ous quarters
Konrad has full of all hands with the refugee camp .
Christian Konrad is in the way that his Word has weight .
the government has used the previous Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Ban@@ ker to set quot@@ as for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the opening centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen took a grip on the handle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the placing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday would be without great work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ piece &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the Interior Minister , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; k@@ ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
all in all , Konrad with a need of 8@@ 5,000 qu@@ arti@@ stes in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number of accommodations , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to provide the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there &apos;s no barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already led talks with the national capit@@ als .
they would have promised him , even to provide further refugees to the upcoming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria , it goes well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supported Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , going to be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
great expectations of the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator set up in the ORF action as well as we . &quot;
on the platform private individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that will be empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for placing the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it cannot be that qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ans must have a certain height of the hands @-@ holder or the size of the finishing .
for short @-@ term , &quot; not@@ ch standards &quot; would apply .
unlike the Ministry of Interior , he has been successful , Konrad with his experience .
I am an older gentle@@ man , who is not without further said in the face of truth .
trans@@ mitting power is its most important weapon .
Conrad and Mai@@ er does not cause the republic any costs as they stated themselves .
they want to increase their workforce to three or four .
the own qu@@ arti@@ stes are not successful yet .
Konrad wanted to set a container at st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but obviously there are problems with the approval .
Linz calls for a better definition
there will be no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to provide refugees for the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment as the people currently use these measures without taking these measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
but further locations should be tested for emer@@ gen@@ cies but for emer@@ gen@@ cies .
criticism of the city council at the organization of the refugees inside the federal country .
other districts need to contribute here .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; limits are not sealed . &quot;
in a longer phone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef Sch@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) further de@@ coded the further procedure in refugee en@@ quiry on Monday .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic would continue to be possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
special moves with refugees to Germany will no longer be given .
however , the safegu@@ ards would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
one of the other EU member states again called for more in solidarity in the refugee question .
the fact that Austria depends on its borders again , is a logical consequence : &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the Germans began .
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the general restoration of the &quot; New Shi@@ pyard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial Park is officially completed .
in four of the six store@@ ys of the office and production buildings , the publicly tra@@ ded IT group S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 sq.@@ m. ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , the clever ones are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T chief Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine to invest in start @-@ up companies of the New Shi@@ pyard and later he ac@@ qui@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some promises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3.3 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ centre , which belongs to one @-@ third of the town of Linz , Austria &apos;s Upper Austria and the Con@@ federation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is designed by Linz AG for 60 years on S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ centre .
the total of 30 per cent of the 2700 square metres in the building are already rented , for another 40 per cent give it qu@@ eries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened the second store in the arcade
the new shop Fur@@ n@@ ace hand@@ bags are located in the new shop .
actually J@@ utta Bre@@ it wanted to put a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old In@@ hab@@ erin of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the exchange market Arctic : after all , it has now received an increase in the form of another business .
in the Fur@@ la shop across the business , in which they sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clo@@ ds of different manufacturers , now everything about ladies hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses are made up of 75 euros .
large bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euros .
the new shop is operational since yesterday .
before , several weeks was rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have long thought , if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bre@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for decision was among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a private site , where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only creatures in the Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots .
her fashion interest has received Bre@@ it from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I share the most , if something developed and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why some wife at looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in decor@@ ating unit , can not answer the woman with l@@ ately safety .
perhaps it &apos;s because a beautiful bag is fit in every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer blade of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place where residents are named An@@ gi@@ ans .
this property also links to some billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he comments on foreign @-@ hos@@ tile , journalists bowed down or know@@ led@@ geable in the international crisis policy - candidate for the presidential candidate is set up power@@ fully in the campaign .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ alz K@@ all@@ stadt , where grand@@ parents of the real estate millions come from .
many New Yor@@ kers with the F@@ promis@@ ist is a concept for many in the wine village at the Wine Route .
man@@ cher in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ place is above -@@ zig ver@@ tic@@ es related to it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the band responsible for Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about p@@ umping .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they are somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their cult type , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
a native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has directed a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous Sp@@ aw@@ ss@@ lings , to which apart from Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in King Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt ( 2014 ) as well as the saying that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he didn &apos;t put it to the king of his heart .
indeed , respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also tend to say that Tr@@ ump is already a little m@@ aul , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the vicinity , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - at pride : the gi@@ ver says it .
Tr@@ ump is thus coming from the village of the investors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began 1885 , when the late grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold@@ s@@ lan@@ ber in the USA .
land@@ marks of the property Group were first land purchases in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to the home , failed on the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ atine was back then .
he did not included Tr@@ ump , because he once was absent without hom@@ olog@@ ation , director of the Institute for Civil History and Ethno@@ graphy , Roland Paul , was declared a movie startup .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the apparent statements of the desc@@ endant .
he repeatedly insi@@ sted on Mexican immigrants in the US , and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to make illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the pole , this is not so lik@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote p@@ ollen of the tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a native Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was borrow@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rest of the wine cle@@ ans more dist@@ ancing the Americans , &quot; he is always so hor@@ ted . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump happens ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension enti@@ tin Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like man@@ a K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family came to a visit to the Church &apos;s organ , which was generally well received .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine the Donald House , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
they find it better if he doesn &apos;t gain the choice , because &quot; he doesn &apos;t have such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
if those who had joined the time of his grandfather in the USA , just like he , he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ tro@@ users Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says .
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
W@@ end@@ le &apos;s film , interviewed for the p@@ umping long , have seen 12 000 kin@@ em@@ akers , even in the USA awak@@ ens the interest .

critics were wonder@@ ing if Thomson was able to wear a hit @-@ show solo without the daughter of Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening was answered with a clear &quot; yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained with a crowd of 1.@@ 136 million and struck slightly The Block ( 83@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .

the last three voices be handed over : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
mystery reveals ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki , possibly have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly showed that The Bachelor wins .
the woman who finally landed at the Bachelor Wood in The Bachelor , was dug in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give up if it is the one that the last Rose has received .
but when we arrived at Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows at the day before check@@ able , you possibly acci@@ dentally got a note on who will be the victory .
Sam Wood sealed his lips through to the final on Thursday
all three women have left in ly@@ rical way about why Wood is the perfect man and they called his sense for hum@@ our , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be their partner in .
however , if the question is asked : &quot; if not you , who should get the last Rose ? &quot; could your answers to the game kill , who won the heart of the bach@@ elor &apos;s .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both called both - except ourselves - Mack@@ ay , as best partner for Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship between the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I walked into the house and ( Sar@@ &apos;s ) and Sam@@ uli , I noticed that they were quite compatible , and I thought the whole course of the show &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is on Earth at his feet , making it so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I &apos;ve seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be a good fit for young people .
from their point of view , Mack@@ ay said , that the last week &apos;s visit , Wood &quot; made sure that Wood &quot; could be one .
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this obviously is not just a game - I &apos;m going to stop there now , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked to choose the Wood , unless she was , she was mist@@ aken .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell it , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is on Wednesday at 7 : 30 p.m. , on Ten Th@@ ames .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
in Detroit and Seattle , huge interest in his move to the U.S. - and there were many other teams that sent to his impressive first day training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne picked the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
some coach would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a little angel like it was the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by @-@ League conver@@ ti@@ t during his first P@@ unt return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and Hay@@ ne issued the next opportunity for a P@@ unt return and also in the ongoing play after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of introducing his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press brief@@ ing after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ reporter cam In@@ man told that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his pat@@ ched catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne is pat@@ ched with a P@@ unt , which was restored in the first quarter of Minnesota Vi@@ kings
certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian bond@@ age for his N@@ FL debut had been hoping for .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ ren@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a wor@@ sen@@ ing start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a thing that happens now , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the cuts with his original debut in 2007 when a pass introduced in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a T@@ ry for Queensland .
nevertheless , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

4 people killed after police bul@@ lets loose in prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after police bul@@ lets in a crowd , opposed the proposed new constitution , said one officer on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday night in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , circa 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ fi , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , some of which threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ fi said that the police have inserted Tr@@ än@@ n@@ as and pushed into the air before they back on rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets were known , of which it is known that they can indeed kill , which are traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , apparently a so high death rate produced .
the discussion was the last two weeks violent protest in Nep@@ als Southern Europe , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ am &apos;s population say that new provinces that were formed under the proposed new constitution will reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the Western Nepal of the Th@@ arus &quot; ethnic group , who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10th .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces - an important step in the direction of a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been ruled over for centuries .
since 2008 , work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ature confirmed this week about certain cl@@ auses in the Constitutional Bill in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .

for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics may be helpful in weight loss surgery .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer live than those who received non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery that wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
you reduce hunger and lim@@ iting the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
O@@ bes@@ ity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proved efficient , but most studies have been carried out in humans that are ob@@ ese fat ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or above .
BMI , a certain degree of weight regarding size , applies as normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI of 30 are considered to be ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - therapeutic treatments for type 2 diabetes in people that were easily overweight .
the average BMI of those who under@@ go this operation decreased from 31 to 2@@ 4.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI of those who were non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment equals 29 .
among the one compl@@ ained to a surgical procedure , with 36 % the diabetes disease dis@@ band@@ ed completely and partly at 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , the diabetes was completely resolved by only one per cent , and in part only about two percent .
furthermore , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des , and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ ols &quot; were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; found the authors .
the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood glucose levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best viewed at 7 % , write the researchers .
according to the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not significantly reduce the mortality rate in five years , such as Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also provides average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , greater response at BMI ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) reported more than complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit from surgery after five years , there is evidence of a study focusing on people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , Black@@ stone says from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was subjected to obesity , 29 per cent less likely to die during 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patient , Black@@ stone said it was soo@@ thing for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; she said .
Black@@ stone added that humans and their doctors should start to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with his BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting for too long until we take people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story at the H@@ uns@@ rück Germany

beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ et reader , because he plays in Lang@@ re@@ ler and surrounding villages .

&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe cannot take all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis is in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end violence in the Hom@@ eland State .
the Dalai Lama spoke to the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the UK in his speech on the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is devoted to eth@@ ics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be challenged before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the response to the West European countries would be admi@@ red by the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama was engaged in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in managing the crisis , he stressed that there was only temporary solution .
&quot; it is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama spoke to the problem of violence and said George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist bombing of September 11 and introduced that the US &apos;s violent reaction in the US took a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to resolve this issue lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he sat down violence , and that was called unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
4 times increase in intake of hand dis@@ infection by children in the last 4 years
toxic control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , which so@@ aked highly in@@ dis@@ infection , the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , there were cases of revenues of dis@@ infection in children under 12 years of age , using tox@@ ins ranging from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are getting more common in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN .
he said that some kids use disinf@@ ect@@ ants , while some do to im@@ press their friends or for a mut@@ ant with the social media .
videos on YouTube show how you@@ ths use disinf@@ ect@@ ant only because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens have supposedly bl@@ ended dis@@ infection with alcohol @-@ based bad water to get harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragran@@ ces as disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that &apos;s bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ ked .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with strawberry , grapes and orange du@@ es that are very appealing for children .

especially with infants can result a few spra@@ ins to the alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the agent , Hospital of the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t have a si@@ p of whis@@ key , but people let this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant reach within reach of children , and if children are coming to it , it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ hai@@ der Russell , a six @-@ year old girl who recently had four injection of fragran@@ t dis@@ infection in the school had been brought to treatment .
her blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice more than the threshold , which is regarded as drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency medical doctor that she treated at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ hai@@ jah picked up her words and wasn &apos;t able to walk as she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors guarded her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of sor@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had joined the head , said K@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; it was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ hai@@ red Mother , CNN .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has advised both parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ est@@ ations outside the child &apos;s operating range .
beyond alcohol pois@@ oning , there were some dis@@ infection with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario women died after the swal@@ lowing of hand infection , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities believe that the product of me@@ thanol contained a le@@ thal solution instead of ethylene alcohol which has been listed as an active substance .
in January , three students of the fourth class in New York State , their &quot; gener@@ alised &quot; teacher were pois@@ oning to educ@@ ate anti @-@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; so it reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to the disinf@@ ect@@ ant disinf@@ ect@@ ant and banned them from their space .
the police viewed the ver@@ dic@@ ted plan as &quot; si@@ ze@@ able &quot; and pointed measures to the school authority .

former rank @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that the Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic people , as there is no title of titles with the Rang@@ ers there .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of Celtic @-@ games more and why ? &quot;
it &apos;s because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people don &apos;t just talk about the return of the sh@@ un@@ ers .
they talk about the old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested .
there &apos;s a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not just the people in Scotland who want to see those games .

now we want to come out as quickly as possible .
I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what is happening .
we feel it exactly like this - but we must continue .
we really need , really the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better .
now , it is so important .

why I will be witnessed an execution in Oklahoma
somewhat later , today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the Oklahoma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection .
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was first mentioned in January about his best friend , even though I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day came closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it &apos;s true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applicants than places available , there is a macro lot@@ tery to decide who is elected .
Oklahoma has hit the number of media sites from 12 to five .
if one who is selected , it will be emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ s@@ ps with whom I have developed my own relationship during the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we laugh often much , when we speak .
the authorities authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook &amp; pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remind myself of all details .
a journalist from Oklahoma , accused me of Twitter , put my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants it and you will receive access .
I compl@@ ained to you .
they acknowledged that she could have been better phr@@ ased , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard Glos@@ s@@ p had problem with some of the things I have spoken and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it , even if he would do it .
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses .
but he wants an international rep@@ orters present to write there .
if he dies , he thinks that public relations work will help the punishment against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter for Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the event , please listen to the series of Podcasts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a fav@@ oured one .
but I think there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective , I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters , which you can contact .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man without unnecessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ ying him and threat@@ ens to end the racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards by Racing Victoria tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables every year and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he foc@@ uss@@ ed on ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria and claimed that they launched a personal campaign against him with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race @-@ day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tries to do what is best for racing , and he himself found himself under difficult conditions , when it went to the positive cob@@ alt @-@ test @-@ sample near Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months for es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it to see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as too high dro@@ oping grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have long been going to eat , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything will come out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know there was far@@ ed .
sometimes , one respon@@ ds to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I &apos;m going to go home today and sleep well .
I want to go down the main road , and I want my owners to think I try my best for them .
if you start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be train@@ ee .
I must consider what I do with my license .
before , Moo@@ dy had uploaded the Bom@@ b interview in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity unit had attempted to sp@@ ade his stall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight months ago Terry Bailey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I &apos;m going to be asked - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they obviously believe I am a sc@@ amm@@ able .
if that is the case , they certainly should have decided on their n@@ oses , because it is trying to summar@@ ize me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former President of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , current President of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should I bring me that , that it &apos;s personal ?
did the RV@@ L behave beha@@ ved and perhaps people outside the Train@@ ers are responsible for what &apos;s happening in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there , that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and cra@@ ck me , and I have no doubt that what I say to think about it now .
but now I have arrived at the point of which I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad .
that makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and to push it , to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ stration of the train@@ ers has constructed up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigations of Li@@ dar@@ i , and Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching made that he could sell &quot; his license about the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known through its preparation of the un@@ lag@@ ged Master of Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race tags treatment rule , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay on the hor@@ semen were applied , which pushed the rules .
&quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing sports .
I have to take over responsibility for this , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my staff did acci@@ dentally build mud onto the leg .
it could have happened yesterday evening .
it could have happened yesterday the whole day , which was also this way .
but it had even so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy might be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the day of the race . an investigation into this matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules , know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; Moo@@ dy said .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy hit fight against ri@@ vals for ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the tac@@ kling his player as the &apos; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &apos; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said the refer@@ ee will have allowed the Storm @-@ Players &quot; Ring@@ ier &quot; with his team during the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Wayne Bennett has made a little clo@@ aked note to the Storm @-@ Team , after his team had achieved the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample set &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland state not &quot; too good &quot; in R@@ ingen .
Bell@@ amy defended the Bay of his team , saying that they are only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; by the tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading coach at his crew seems to agree with him because it means that they were wor@@ ries about the Storm @-@ Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is getting up again - I didn &apos;t hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about battle struggles , when they defeated us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing at our def@@ ensive system or techniques in the whole year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles on a real focus , and that has provided the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to get used to it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this emerg@@ es again at this time of year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of the &quot; exciting soccer &quot; and remind his ment@@ or that Benn@@ el@@ ets St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons called the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne talks about exciting football .
he compared his play on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting their game was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said .
I remember that St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team in 2010 , and Wayne said he will take care of a divorce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially its young players at their speed .
that &apos;s the ball game you want to play if you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , and now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so they can play as they play .
I build more confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried , to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it comes to the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roo@@ ster reached a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against Cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is it a thri@@ lling game ?
or are breaks and do not have any points the span ?
for me , there are the maps .
when they mention to us , it means that we will be able to meet in a phase .
the Storm @-@ Team has been free at this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales will be starting next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit on drug acc@@ age
a man , possibly a li@@ fel@@ ong penalty is threatened to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were destroyed to Queensland , was granted a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police took 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America over V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants during the morning and later in the Café Si@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police took 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life penalty for the attempt to own a commercial quantity co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic argument that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan was concerned about the danger of flight at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often proceeds to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
in the case of law he lied the police above his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ a &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as safety together to achieve his release .
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ its of the two persons it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Judge Flan@@ agan .
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to keep him from it , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he reports on the police every day and stops at the police every day and stops at a cur@@ few block at 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

the Prosec@@ ution E@@ ili@@ ie Robertson said the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a g@@ out that he would be addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people .
he said that searching for his search was done on the computer , but said it was done , because he wanted to maintain a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ oph@@ ile .
he asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did to attract them .
he said he was ill in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder .
MS Robertson added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the trem@@ bling and weeping .
then she saw some decent pictures on the phone and con@@ front the accused .
the girl has been interviewed and said that the def@@ endant has used computers and Play@@ station to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .

H@@ og@@ g was granted in this case , but was held in custody for hearing of hear@@ ings on other cases .
he was still taken prior to the date of judgment to the list of sexual offen@@ ders .

the powerful T@@ ief is the pi@@ er of the &quot; Henry , &quot; who was pulled to the Atlantic in the past few days from the Bermuda Islands .
storms and storms are expected in Baden especially in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , in the Black Forest , the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and the ground @-@ seek@@ er rice with ar@@ ches from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour is still in the Black Forest .
last Friday the sun will be shining again .
the mass makes it possible : for the two years , the high@@ ways at the IAA tell their innovations .
in 2015 , especially the movement for the shelf @-@ vehicles that are currently particularly well sold .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : approximately 2@@ 8.1 percent of the new appro@@ vals were accounted for by the German Federal Ro@@ ots Office ( KBA ) alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( International Audi@@ ence Day , 17 to 27 September ) .
a lot of new compact models will be presented between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars this year .
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German motor@@ home is the Opel Astra , which will stand in the fall near the dealers in autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
with this , the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra should not be much more expensive .
Opel presents a step @-@ up below the largest competi@@ tor Volkswagen Golf in view , starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra is cost from € 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
moreover , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and fuel engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , as well as three @-@ cylinder petrol engine .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is first just five @-@ fifth .
as the second variant will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which is also shown at the IAA 2013 .
and what about the Astra at the IAA Motor Show more ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault will send the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only five a five @-@ door in a conventional and a marked sporty GT version .
in the early next year , he is also proving to be com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ spin@@ off@@ s wants to find his position in the growing segment .
the compact Infin@@ iti will fit into the brand &apos;s design line with its curved lines .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the new segment is the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , who is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
Bal@@ eno &apos;s sales start is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed , it is the compact car level DS 4 , which is visible at the IAA Motor Show .
on the outside , the designers of the noble Citroën presented the front part : the radiator grill has been re@@ drawn , and the spotlight was equipped with LED technology .
the interior has been moderni@@ zed with the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system , which reduces the number of buttons by a touch@@ screen and is also integrated with Ap@@ ples Car@@ play .
on top of the IAA in the compact class , there was a number of re@@ working and new variants such as the fixed Mercedes A @-@ Class or Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meter cell semi @-@ un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has granted a former in@@ mate of the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary detention facility , which was to be incar@@ cer@@ ated in a small cell .
because of the violation of human rights , in@@ mates are legally entitled to financial compensation when they are incar@@ cer@@ ated in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
those affected can then even hope for money if they were locked only a few days in the confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successfully completed in Karlsruhe , Germany : he was accommod@@ ated in an individual cell with around five square metres floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was clean @-@ separated .
after that , the man , who has now been on the open foot according to his lawyer , had moved to a larger cell .
on the lack of detention conditions , his detention conditions against the Berlin State was failed .
however , the Constitutional Court rec@@ alled the ruling of the Berlin chamber of Berlin and turned back to the repeated inspection .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity viol@@ ated .
Kammer@@ ral tribunal resol@@ ves the amount of the compensation .
even if legal reasons from the frac@@ tive period only a few days in prison for the compensation were decisive , an equivalent claim was the name of it .
otherwise it would be &quot; a mu@@ til@@ ation of the legal gu@@ ardian of the personality . &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ al must now clari@@ fy the amount of money .
the constitutional in@@ verter has often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
so they first spoke to an in@@ mate to claim damage in April , because he was imprisoned in a prison cell .
as a result of 2011 , there is also a decision that the multi @-@ allocation of a cell without separate toilet .
additionally on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court , which an in@@ mate in a parallel event , confirmed a decent housing in a parallel event in November 2009 .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff of the former pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff took place between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had already made headlines in the headlines in the past weeks .
prisoners are therefore growing again 23 hours , the aggressi@@ veness , even to r@@ end@@ ings , should have already been in danger of the alleged layer .
according to information from the judicial authorities , 21 places in the Te@@ gel are not occupied due to young defects , 19 are to drop away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating the &quot;
immigration from refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
according to forecasts from the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany even managed to absorb a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can create it . &quot;
what comes to Germany , gives the following overview .
it is needed after various forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Defence ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but especially at affordable properties : 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social @-@ dwell@@ ings are made out of the rental price and are to apply for this particularly affordable housing .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 80 000 social apartments per year have to be spent annually and that the agreement would have to invest € 6.4 billion per year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we agree that scientists and federal ministers agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Professional Research , 55 percent of the poultry sector can be employed in Germany .
however , refugees in Germany were not systematically asked about their quali@@ fications , in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Stiftung .
on the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for valu@@ ations in the application of the company , but also for self @-@ este@@ em the immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
according to the Thr@@ än@@ hardt , in Germany there has been a political turn in Germany : from the ban on employment for refugees to recognise jobs .
while a employment ban was planned for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Residen@@ z@@ pf@@ licht , the asylum seek@@ ers are restricted to a residential location .
in society , too - because of the skilled workers - mainly the visibility was exposed , refugees need to be made faster to access to the labour market .
a big hur@@ dle to access to the labour market are missing German .
so far there is no sufficient support to general and professional language courses .
research also shows that work@@ places are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
the installation of networks is therefore , for the view of the Throne of the Royal Road to work integration .
the Berlin school authorities have found that only a few wing@@ ed parents have their children to the put@@ ties , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for ent@@ e@@ oting parents it is only once more important to come together to family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ esch@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family from the benefits of Kit@@ a , the administr@@ ators share in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators sharply rising to refugees by the great number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase the capacity of professionals - for example by reducing more experts .
in the countries , students without German knowledge have been prepared in welcome classes .
they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one quali@@ fications in German as a second language .
there is no lack , says Be@@ ate st@@ alls at the Berlin school administration .
the German student body estimates that around 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study in Germany .
basically no federal asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ ser studies - the only exception was Berlin , In@@ st@@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its attitude .
study cons@@ ents of refugees could be reli@@ eved of the university entrance .
because refugees with a residence permit or for@@ ds received no performance after asylum seek@@ ers . more , if they begin studying .
the latter is generally not a B@@ af@@ ö@@ G as they do not fall under the circle of b@@ af@@ ici@@ dal individuals .
Ged@@ ul@@ ted refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany so far , to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ G , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
but this funding gap must also be closed , calls for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Student &apos;s Guide .
the students should get started with B@@ af@@ ö@@ G immediately .
Islam will continue to play a more important role , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
under Islam , the state should gradually ev@@ acu@@ ate the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches @-@ right towards a new state @-@ religions ratio .
it would also be important to the establishment of an islam@@ ic welfare association , which takes care professional to the new@@ com@@ ers .
among the rights are also obligations .
so the representatives of Islam must unite to clear contacts , and be willing to collabor@@ ate with the State in many areas and to conce@@ aling certain control options .
it also belongs to the read@@ iness to take part against religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Council of the Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts may also be entered to Germany .
those who wanted to change these conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately their right to stay here , &quot; in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he suggested to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will now have much more to be a topic of society today .
this will also change the majority shareholder in order to prevent Dis@@ crimin@@ ation of discrimination and rac@@ ism .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - have been a anti @-@ discrimination and a General Gender Equality Act .
but it stays very slowly , as the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ series showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migration organisations and the advoc@@ acy groups are long enough to challenge the international agreement as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention in Germany must be a reality in the coming years , when the country will remain peac@@ efully and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is capable of providing healthcare to previously expected refugees , while Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery said .
&quot; in terms of management and capacity , we create it , &quot; he said the daily mirror .
however , additional money has to flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery calls for the Con@@ ven@@ es right at the Registration Health Card .
moreover , performances could be rep@@ uted with the federal states .
and in the long run , it is highly question@@ able , so many people with the limited power catalogue to see asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise , doctors make the doctors especially to create the language barriers .
already until now , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has been demonstrated , migrants should be clari@@ fied worse than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical surg@@ eries , would need to be paid on interpre@@ ting costs , she demands .
it would be helped many refugees but also with more general medical start @-@ up in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic ga@@ ze .
under the refugee camps , there are some significantly more treated ob@@ struc@@ tions , and with the young people there is HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
however , with the partial other disease har@@ vest@@ ments , German doctors from her education became clear but clearly , Mont@@ gom@@ ery comments .
&quot; paras@@ ite case or tuberculosis is not so hard to recognize ... &quot; and which concerns the trouble is in sight by the refugees , even reli@@ eving in sight .
the Syrians would have a highly developed education system , and some of them were doctors .
in order to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualification and re@@ acts perhaps once again .
at least half of the refugees in Germany are subject to estimates of the federal legislative chamber ( B@@ Pt@@ 100 ) psych@@ ically ill : the majority suffer from post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
particularly vulnerable are the children of Refu@@ gee , declared Dietrich Ir@@ z , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study by TU München , that each fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
whoever reli@@ es on a post@@ trau@@ matic stress @-@ disorder is suffering from amongst other things in Flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , dizziness , heart rate and death problems .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , severe fri@@ ght@@ fulness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic diseases , an early treatment may be necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
so far , only four percent of the psych@@ ic sick refugees get a psycho@@ therapy .
in fact , psychological illness for asylum seek@@ ers may present a request for psycho@@ therapy , but most of the treatment are usually several months .
in addition , in the social offices mostly lab@@ our@@ ers or doctors , who are not trained for mental illness , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream
with the new production of &quot; passion , &quot; Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst uses the traditions of the cir@@ cus art .
the goal is to draw each age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal inci@@ dents and unique entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus invites you to the man@@ ege on the bricks and was@@ ps to dream .
&quot; our passion is a cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior rac@@ er .
the slogan &quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current short@@ age of production .
for more than 33 years , cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family .
so the gift to inspire is the family in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to take away the people from her everyday rush and lead them to another world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year old Juni@@ or@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; man &apos;s cocktail with world city fl@@ air , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept .
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometer tour can now experience this fl@@ air .
the cir@@ cus programme convin@@ ces with talented artists from around the world .
excellent at the International Cir@@ cus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family draws the audience with w@@ it and charm in their spell .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their crafts .
it makes the Cuban duo loose with the heroes of the silent films .
light@@ ness and flexibility - they identify themselves with those words .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women in storm .
besides numerous salmon sal@@ ts the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus is also fascinated by finger @-@ ti@@ ghtness and joint strength .
bal@@ ancing the unic@@ ycle on a ball ?
not a problem for He yuan .
snake creatures are fascinating and dis@@ ma@@ yed at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little other and fascinated by its mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; Steph@@ ans Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ rup@@ tions in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal protection organisations .
Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes on this position : &quot; is it not good for our animals , neither is it good for us . &quot;
some 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every match @-@ unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are affection@@ ately mentioned , will have the possibility of reading the eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
the animal doesn &apos;t feel good , it doesn &apos;t want to be in the arena .
the highest commandment is : good for animals .
specially on their zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ shore P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra@@ stu@@ te , the family is pro@@ li@@ fic .
the two animals spent eight years in one recei@@ pts and nothing is happening .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; Brigitte S@@ bst talked about .
the zeb@@ ra is not ready for the climb , but it is the unique mascot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 viewers , we always give our best and with all your heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst charges between 17 and 20 September daily at 17 and 20 o &apos;clock to his performances .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 pm .
Thursday is the family day , for the show at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
the arri@@ vals are open every day from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe President Robert Mu@@ gabe holds a false speech in the European Parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the steps at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the Falls made fast through the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by the claims by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany the speech by Mr Mu@@ gabe .
last month , they had booked him and interrupted him during his speech at the State of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ tions politicians received SMS messages on their cell phones that they warned against Mr. Mu@@ ch &apos;s speech to distur@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to journalists going up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the affected Parliament members that ends immun@@ ity in the Parliament , and once they leave Parliament to take effect of parliamentary immun@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leader said that Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard will store up to 30,000 employees
Hewlett @-@ Packard , 25,000 to 30,000 employees will be employed as part of the restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed societies and the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service @-@ service activities .
the expected job loss results in a load of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP predicted in a statement .
&quot; these re@@ struc@@ tive measures will enable a more competitive cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ woman and Chief Executive Committee that will divide the unit after separation .
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise is smaller and brigh@@ tly @-@ focused than HP today , and we have a wide and sophisticated portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has annual sales of more than $ 50 billion and will be focused on providing integ@@ rating , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company .
it is divided into a company that was founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill to Hewlett @-@ Dave Packard , whose Palo Alto was called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive re@@ structure run to tackle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturers , and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field that is based on the belief that tight @-@ focused companies produce a better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ate must stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind which last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and provided his rehabilitation after plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the European Championship will certainly be uncertain .
the big dis@@ grace with this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ le injury and returned to his old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not threatened the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
no bigger issue .
this was just an accident .
it wasn &apos;t in connection with his Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from purely medical perspective , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there are the related danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return to the middle of season .
it also develops an un@@ comfortable design .
the study by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ as@@ es@@ en from the last five games .
the wider picture of Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League club since 2007 / 08 due to one of the two Premier League clubs that have shown most of the vulner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger accepted the potential of a v@@ icious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that improvement in the case of injuries during the last season is going to pers@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a time in which you must strengthen your body and combat tension , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome them .
I hope , his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the kind that he deserves .
Arsenal begins his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur in the coming Wednesday and Wen@@ ger is making a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not widely travelled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta show .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to hold the equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um and to win the players who need it to indul@@ ge a small sn@@ u@@ ff break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal had clear favor@@ ites , through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the largest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is un@@ defeated after 41 games after the inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , whereby it was measured on the Richter scale .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal had drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains driven by far away hope to lead the club to his first European ap@@ ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immen@@ sely , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
never has it worked for arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
friendship Fest : the Com@@ edy Show , which gave us serious lessons on men &apos;s friendly skills
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how to open the need for men to open , now even more desper@@ ate than ever before , as self @-@ murder rates among young males on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high show .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in males aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ aign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ms ( CA@@ LM ) campaign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) 2015 marked the year of a man with the aim to seek the culture in question if they need them to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
a current study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms broke out that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances are doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritual , wholes@@ ome , and the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends only , so that friendship can work .
in the age of social media , communication , with its focus on style on substance , is often more important than an important contact with its emphasis on substance over substance .
our digital life have the need to be strong , fun , and successfully appearing , doubled , even though in reality the isolation is dominated .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values call ; money , image , social status , all at cost in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health a much deeper .
and like a video play inventor , and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this concent@@ rating on his head was put on .
every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which inspired by interaction as a friend .
the humor of Jo@@ ey and Chand@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in the football club in cozy arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging from Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can relate to everyone , even if they often return to explore fully their feelings .
as a staff member of the phone past@@ oral care declared to me : ... &quot; my hearing @-@ role for people who are depres@@ sive and self @-@ je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed , really proved to me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to speak to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old speech &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as feeling that it is perceived as weakness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to me in the sense , when I try to offer long @-@ term viewing mechanisms .
it presents very clearly the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ si@@ der status via the phone to help people in ey@@ es@@ despair may also help to assist the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed back@@ drop , why don &apos;t you take your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k with .
or , even better , if you could see sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what the difference might be your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the complete 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest

angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held the course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ ge stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League de@@ but@@ s as PS@@ G player , who brought the French champion to the way , but after that they upgraded it a number of occasions when they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head gate in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A required Paris a strong start against the Swedish master since she had not only stri@@ ve for the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds , but improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was no class champion of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mov@@ a chances before the goal . he was later replaced in the game against his home @-@ team and against the club , with whom he had started making his lively career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League , so it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to gra@@ ci@@ fy our opponents , even if there are certain things we have to perfect over the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won &apos;t win , although I regret it was not one or two more goals . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to his injury in one of three modifications to the Paris team , which could with@@ hold a 2 : 2 draw on its own place towards Bordeaux in the first league , but he was thrown out by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ in@@ ean section of Argentina was referred to as the man to take the PS@@ G on the next level in Europe , and he pointed out why he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malmö Defense , before he finished in the long corner of the network .
however , if somebody believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , that was disappointed .
Malmö , the Celtic in a Play @-@ off proposed to reach this level , came with An@@ pi@@ ff with nine nation@@ alists on the field and was stir@@ red up with a five @-@ man def@@ enses and two deep in the middle field .
but beside a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who pass well to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ FO@@ s in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself used himself sometimes , with some mis@@ sions and bad agreements , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who at no less than five trials was pat@@ ched only in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , which Di Maria was converted into a shooting , which was led by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute by the p@@ ho@@ ists ...
the second gate finally fell shortly after the hour brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus scored its sixth win after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all thoughts that Malmö could go back in the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could stop the final result , before replacement of Ez@@ ez@@ ys Lav@@ e@@ zzi was put at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year .
since then , we have played only in the Swedish League , which did not the same level .
the qualifying matches don &apos;t go out . &quot;
hats off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented switching from 2008 to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi is playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern obviously stood shortly before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , which played at the time for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish Champion , three times winner champion winner , twice champion League winner , two time European Champion champion , two time champion , one time champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in the summer , the now 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca betra@@ ys X@@ avi , however , that he already stood before the departure of Barcelona before the year 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one told me that Bar@@ ça would like to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Madrid won anything then , &quot; he &apos;s nothing , &quot; he told me .
and the registered cover of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ bl@@ ig@@ saw wanted me to have . &quot;
in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not changed
but the bill was not managed .
and the decisive man for this day is still working for the German record master : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Gu@@ ardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ EP has told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film .
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ted the af@@ ro@@ American filmmaker Eff@@ ie Brown on the variety of topics and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
as a result of the Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown as this under@@ lined the need of alternative perspectives and in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen script .
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then you do it with the occupation of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; they insured Dam@@ on .
brown re@@ acted , with insul@@ ting un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay . &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian had fir@@ med .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer Ben @-@ Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to encourage people to think about it - who will always be the director , as they treat the character of the Harmony , &quot; Brown said first .
the only black person , and she is a sp@@ ik@@ y that is beaten by her white hal@@ ves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direct rights at the film , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on answered that her direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , social media explo@@ ded on Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger via the clip in turning &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the space , so it can explain its diversity - that is SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the Twe@@ et has more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its publication .
women &apos;s comments come to a point where the precise racial representation in the media stands at the head of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown has been killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Movement of Black Li@@ ves achieved a nationwide effect and urged the legisl@@ ature and authorities to stop discrimin@@ ating practices against col@@ li@@ de content .
in February , the singer Prince made an appeal to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at Grammy Awards .
&quot; recordings ob@@ tru@@ ed , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) .
like books and black lives , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves People &apos;s Movement have published an explanation as a response to the question of Fox News personality Elizabeth H@@ assel@@ beck , if the group was to be regarded as a hatred group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the Führer .
recently , Dam@@ on was found on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation , or has already met the Pope , is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Ninja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sports climbing and operation aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first Ath@@ let who took the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the Great Prize of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which had just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant , which could shut down all stages of his obstac@@ le par@@ cours .
during the seasonal finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , to the finals .
the climb to the last task was to climb on a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten had finished the job within the time that he finished the first Ath@@ let that finished the demanding phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge more than three seconds faster than the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero talked with E ! news after the hard fought game , still under the shock of the profit from the Grand Prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or ever , &quot; said Isaac E ! over his bunch of money .
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the introduc@@ tory producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finals and why B@@ ritten , although he finished at all the circuit , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , you get the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , he gets the great gra@@ ti@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he won something for something .
he &apos;s just so happy to have done what he has done .
masses of awards received by fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac wouldn &apos;t have felt like if they hadn &apos;t changed the roles .
America Ninja Warrior was extended to play an open season , starting fil@@ ming in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks to Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ I APO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for Detroit Tig@@ ers .
previously , they once were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler . however , this part played perfectly against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field .
T@@ wins claimed a chance to raise the A@@ scen@@ sion in a half @-@ half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild@@ card position .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that was so difficult to express itself over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad exhaust .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support as Detroit got three times in the first two routes , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hits a 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and made three wheels .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; Simon said .
it is hard to throw at the bull@@ pen every game , and so I just want to go into the game .
the designated tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sha@@ ken the wood of wood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ex@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( perc@@ ussions ) , looked much better from the bull@@ pen and he brought it right into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear at the end of the seventh inside , T@@ wins &apos;s best chance to come back into the game again .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the inning with a double in the left field line .
Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colorful , and Simon introduced his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy left the wall , the only man who was confron@@ ted with whom he was confron@@ ted with the designer ro@@ ok@@ ie Miguel S@@ ano , who demo@@ lition a Two @-@ Run from the right @-@ handed three w folders .
with a pair of runner @-@ up and the finishing run in the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen came to the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor of Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a double Play .
it was the major meeting of the major league the 27th time in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ches was hit Double Play
after Detroit added a Insurance Run , at the end of the ninth round , the wall achieved an R@@ BI double against the cr@@ ot@@ ess of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed got S@@ ano with three pitch for its fifth mail@@ ings .
Detroit benef@@ ited for the lu@@ de of the game by an even un@@ mov@@ able Phil Hughes .
the Tig@@ ers took three rings in the first two routes to the right @-@ handed boxing , who had been d@@ ashed in front of the game from the vulner@@ abilities , after he had been missing a month because of a back @-@ suffering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the start I wished for , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Hughes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt like I released and felt that I would make some pretty good Pit@@ ches there on the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ER gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in sc@@ oring position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ ano followed a single , but made another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get the third , which the threat ended .
the Tig@@ ers laid in the second one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out single from center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a great blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not hit especially well , but he caught the right spot .
Hughes had been in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , scored no points in the third inning , before it was replaced by the T@@ ie@@ ver right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hughes , three hits came with six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal Sanchez was out of an off@@ ence of the cured school .
he is investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated on the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007 .
Sanchez , since mid @-@ August on the case of injuries , is supposed to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with Sán@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is y@@ elled from the vulner@@ abilities to start the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July .
he had been missing on August 20th because of a l@@ ashing in the right th@@ igh .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games at target field on Wednesday .
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4@@ 43 ER@@ A ) is fought against Minnes@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Santana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Re@@ formation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of the president , Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino was inaugurated on Wednesday a previously well @-@ known place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German re@@ mun@@ ators .
he is now honoured as &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of Re@@ formation . &quot;
the park lies in the middle of Rome , beside the Col@@ osse@@ um .
the name was applied by the Evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , the minister of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es existed for centuries as a minority often only in secret to their faith .
with the place I become visible in a symbolic manner that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was as young August@@ ine @-@ mon@@ k @-@ mon@@ k to the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city then as the sin@@ ful man of sin .
his negative impressions allowed him to be encouraged by histori@@ ans in his future struggle against Rome .
Luther then initiated the spl@@ itting of the Western Church with his theses .
hammer artist invested three years in the Bible &apos;s personal interpretation
Jesus and the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the main pieces that Ot@@ mar Alt let painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and Bible texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that has now been published with sum@@ p@@ tuous images .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has form@@ ulated his personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and screen in 150 pictures .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but by no means in@@ significant is with &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary : the respective issues are adapted , that may be quite easy .
in his Bible project , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he met a sub@@ jective @-@ artistic selection from many subject areas of &quot; book of all books . &quot;
develop cycles , which are dedicated to topics like cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ern@@ ity .
thus he has spont@@ aneously fascinated multiple partner : this applies to the Luther Verlag with his the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books .
and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has eng@@ ed himself on the basis of painting with the relevant verses .
he interpreted the interpre@@ ts of the Ot@@ mar Alt Bible verses and thus today , into current relationships . &quot;
these texts are like composite mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
embedded between the original Bible collection by Martin Luther and one of the artist &apos;s original Bible , he form@@ ulated his personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jewellery one has golden cou@@ sins .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows an instant insight into his soul , his emotions .
that is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
they ultimately became a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict protest@@ ant ruler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there came up early education with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pi@@ cane &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to re@@ work you , perhaps to bear me back with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to help art in a qu@@ icker time : &quot; the perception of imag@@ ery is shaped by pro@@ ver@@ tise , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being driven out there .
artists have a different desire and delight , to show stuff .
pictures have always somewhat mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard , I am a dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like to &quot; reveal the viewer into the images , &quot; letting them appear , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the picture ad@@ mits his oppos@@ ing . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost started on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; a lover from Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; I like how he lives with his paintings . &quot;
I did not think about the Bible to be complete , but selected topics were selected for him .
&quot; it was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; Alt@@ ep@@ ost says : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text expl@@ aining merely &quot; that &apos;s a picture Bible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öhler from Luther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Pictures speak for M@@ öhler for both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as responsibility .
a section of the origin@@ als - paper and paint images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition presenting at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15 .
start of construction for BM@@ X rail
plans , place found , businesses were commissioned to model@@ ed ground level for a round circuit : one year later , almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X rail was completed .
settlements in politics and administration were preparing for land@@ ings , especially with the residents who didn &apos;t toler@@ ate the train .
thus hills moved down , new place - now with formal planning and application of construction permits .
the approval will go in October and was able to inform the first public prosecutor at Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock , who now attend children &apos;s children &apos;s youth committee .
&quot; I hope this year &apos;s still visible , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there should be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blu@@ epr@@ int &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; began with the work during the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees from 2019 to 2019 , the Bundesliga match its significant sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the soccer re@@ acts to the real situation in Germany and sec@@ ures policy with the help of increasing problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I hold that for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there is no one to say in principle , that &apos;s nothing , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interested in every single thing to get a grip on the handle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he plans to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am the next Wednesday at the Kanz@@ ler@@ amt and meet there the Minister of State , wife Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ uz and the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be certain important role in the issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football could and would help .
but the decisive points must be policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German soccer federation has therefore expanded its refugee modes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated on the ver@@ ge of the UEFA Meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some Bundes@@ li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
as early as this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ ters put a clear sign when they will present &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left @-@ hand tri@@ cot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that all of them should help , where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ head Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler set the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Self @-@ understand@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes on , nobody shall see it . &quot;
&quot; we know football @-@ like , no , we need to use our jet power , our influence and our ways to help the many refugees that have so incredibly suffered to help , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ ders director Peter Ret@@ tig talked about a &quot; prominent symbol of the League . &quot;
for European trials on Hungary this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a major association of German football . &quot;
that all 36 license agreements had started in their own projects would be great .
the great thing is that small and smallest compar@@ es are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we spent is living in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of tremendous significance , &quot; he said .
this year , the association is working together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government to provide 300 000 Euro for integration of refugees at the beginning of the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the associations have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP board President loses an eye for accident
the board of Directors of Europe &apos;s biggest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has reportedly lost several reports by a fall in July the left eye .
at the accident on the stairs to his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he was fallen out onto a water glass that he carried in the left hand , the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; ( Wednesday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost blind@@ ed , was anyway power@@ less , tow@@ ed out on the road - that &apos;s what he told us so last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet in front of the Supervisory Board at Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager joined the meeting and is &quot; fully operational . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , which will come back to Germany in October and further into the software pow@@ erh@@ ouse .
&quot; I am full of SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s important to rise again , if you like it . &quot;

the national player will also call the table leader of the soccer league in the du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot go back , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
if R@@ eus is back on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B Coach open : &quot; we expect a return from it to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high burden of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his family eleven on the R@@ eus position .
he then announced a change at the por@@ ters position .
this is why novel Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the space of tri@@ bal Roman Bür@@ ki .

whether a turn@@ al in the future will be used in all Europe @-@ League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open .
with high lik@@ el@@ ihood , it will also deny the second game .
the for@@ en@@ ching statement by mit@@ re R@@ eus , that the Fin@@ al@@ rede@@ em for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europe League will be the objective , means mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl for comprehen@@ sible : &quot; that &apos;s not what Marco is not so wrong . &quot;

robot fleet : government wants to play pioneer for Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany is supposed to be the change of cars techn@@ ologically .
the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which also sees investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the International Motor Show at Frankfurt .
the automated driving and connected drive will increase road safety and guarantee less stability , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he also wants to discuss the subject with his counterpart from the G7 states , who also come together with representatives of the industry .
among other things , the Strateg@@ ic Committee of the Transport of Transport also emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broadband connection and a joint @-@ level switch on digital radio stations .
at the moment , testing new technology is currently underway on the 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks to be bur@@ dened , the federal government plans to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and , wherever necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany is aiming for ensuring that the maximum speed of self @-@ prop@@ elled cars has increased from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to put in a change in the Vienna Convention , so far only man sees the man as a driver .
when automated driving takes over , the car becomes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that record the environment and process data in seconds .
based on a study by the state department , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways could be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless passengers are expected to be expected on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value of value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study by 2025 to some 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD Russia politician S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability for failure and security of the personal data of the driver has to be clearly explained .
but the Germans are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA Institute of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the DE@@ K@@ RA orders come to the result that autonomous driving cars will be able to prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent expect only in 20 years so that 31 percent do not believe it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surveyed expect for autonomous cars by 2025 , in the US 33 percent .
anyway the drivers in Germany are not willing to travel completely to an self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a response to the digital association of Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree , control during the whole journey to all roads .
at the same time the flow of fluid traffic could still be reached by 15 percent , at st@@ au 45 percent .
well , everybody would leave the car to control under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
the Düsseldorf wants to stand as current stand at the cover fighting from 25 September to 4 October only in singles .
the final decision was to fall by no later than 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough even without Timo the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ ting trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM teaching in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time , B@@ oll was located at that time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsored Sponsor@@ enter@@ min in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the down@@ side , we are no longer a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said US champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a enf@@ ant .
a mixture of a big fashion show and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaulle ( 63 ) published an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins that look very devastating thanks to video projections .
they bear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as scenery out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and there@@ with that he put males in skir@@ ts .
&quot; I can &apos;t say this today that I &apos;m the enf@@ ant and the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was easy to be , meanwhile , it is real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ aul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk to The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initial stance at a show about his person .
he had actually been on the other hand , because : &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit like death , &quot; he said .
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly @-@ looking work of man , wrote the fashion history , without ever completing a training .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it is a perfectly chore@@ ograph@@ ed total work that was done for the much work : to devour the pupp@@ ets , for example , a styl@@ ist is involved .

the year @-@ old Teddy was also featured in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , f@@ ag@@ ic stain@@ ing tests of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and po@@ or@@ ly in football ) he attracted his Teddy B@@ HS and clothes said Gaul@@ tier .
his parents would not allow him to play with a doll .
the dis@@ card of fashion is later taught himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers related to Kad@@ ett in Munich .
later I bought it later .
he didn &apos;t pay the models for his first fashion show .
they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - pl@@ au@@ ded top as fashion @-@ niche
some time it went to the long nitrogen machines in and around Pl@@ auen about pulling meters .
the embroi@@ dered materials and tips created in large quantity for customers , which they worked for example to ceilings and curtains .
today wasn &apos;t working anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt explains , managing director of the Equ@@ est@@ rian .
instead , fashion is important .
in the first time of the pl@@ undering , fashion has played a major role , then it was pushed into a home textile industry - and now is re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt tells some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
even the so @-@ called vintage fashion which re@@ jects past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen , an ever threat of the tractor .
anyone who does not operate in the textile branch in Germany is no longer in the market .
it already accounts for half of all orders .
Mo@@ ik@@ in Pl@@ auen , together with nine other companies , is a member of the industry @-@ based Pl@@ au@@ ener top and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they can carry the protected label .
in the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales were broken away .
private specialty and retail stores almost no longer exist .
our products are hardly available on this path .
these mass merchan@@ dise are produced much cheaper in the Asian region , almost exclusively sold through chains .
furthermore , export , currently available to Russia and the United States .
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also attempts to score through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer declared by the nitrogen in Falk@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we have been introducing a quality label that demonstrates that we produce environmental and soci@@ ally intoler@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
Diplom@@ a Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger outside of the Sax@@ onian University of Z@@ wick@@ au - in the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ dery and tips .
in order to opp@@ ose the competition from Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designer and the enterprises that need to think particularly economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , a existing design , often only slightly varies to keep a customer base .
some years ago animated textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter new the historic breed of snow .
the machine still rocks small cu@@ ffs at some places .
the Pl@@ au@@ er Gold@@ sch@@ mie@@ de Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Krau@@ se inspired himself : &quot; before that , I was not able to start with traditional pl@@ ums . &quot;
now she uses the snow tip for its jewelry .
it shapes the pattern in silver in an elabor@@ ate process .
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the subject of pl@@ ast@@ ens - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
it is also available in the United States , Australia and Finland - especially with customers who have lived their ancestors in Pl@@ auen and the surrounding area and would like to wish for a reminder .
this makes me see my jewelry as the top am@@ bass@@ adors of the pl@@ ast@@ ener top .

XI p@@ ushes to open the economy bro@@ ader for the world
the economy must open bro@@ ader for out@@ ward to fo@@ ster growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said to a group commissioned to the reform of the reform .
&quot; China should encourage themselves to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how , and to improve the strategies for business founders , &quot; said in an address at the 16th session of the Central Committee for the Deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform .
new start @-@ ups and drive reforms will bring new moment@@ um and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , said X@@ i .
the leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list on the regulation of market access , relaxation of the border controls policy , promoting private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the residents of the population .
after the statement , a negative list is identified , the sectors and companies identified , which are not in question for investment .
the system is tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance , as it indicates the market a major role in the allocation of resources , ensuring a legal scale of business and open to the market , the statement said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government is also ensuring inspec@@ tions about the company transferred to the company and ensuring that businesses can decide how to conduct their businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic operation and new mechanisms in promoting regional growth .
as part of an offer , to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further fields are opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and bring better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , it is easier to apply for foreigners , to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zes the requirements and the application process will be facil@@ itated .
the right to guarantee the lawyers , to exercise their activity , as well as professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , were also discussed during a meeting .
at the meeting also Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and an important leader such as Liu Yun@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in one of the declaration issued , took part in the meeting .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a corresponding paper member of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans to critic@@ ise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side @-@ side @-@ end industrial and environmental policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is said to have increased the limit values of the nerve blood at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ ks or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; from a fish weighing on two milli@@ grams of mercury .
but large pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes , however , are already so strong with mercury that might not be sold on the basis of the estimated limit values 50 percent of the cat@@ ches .
according to dou@@ bling of the limit values , only 14@@ ,5 % would be in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable .
according to F@@ ood@@ wrist@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values in other fish of currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
F@@ ood@@ cow@@ ards , however , described this as &quot; trick &quot; because these are smaller Fried@@ y , such as car@@ p usually bur@@ dened as low as they already comply with the planned maximum values today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction in Kl@@ einf@@ isch was therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ der di@@ sposition man@@ oeu@@ vre that helps only the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal that has grown rapidly throughout the food chain , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small quantities of particularly inf@@ ant damage to the nervous system could cause &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Culture declared on his homepage with regard to valid awards but that a &quot; health advoc@@ ate of the general population &quot; is not expected .
mercury enters the environment mainly by coal combustion .
according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of Justice to the Gre@@ ens Parliamentary Group , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ o@@ stri@@ pe out more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total in Germany em@@ itted total .
the concentration of mercury in fish have been around El@@ be , Rhine and Donau &quot; have been &quot; permanently more and more country @-@ wide , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had been cited in March of paper .
last year , European war@@ nings from mercury in fish have already picked up the most commonly reported health risks in the R@@ AS@@ FF warning system .
