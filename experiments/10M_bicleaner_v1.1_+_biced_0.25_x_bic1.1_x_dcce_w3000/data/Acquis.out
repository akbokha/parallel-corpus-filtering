bearing in mind that the contract according to Article IV paragraph 1 is not to be excluded as if thereby the un@@ utter@@ ed right of all parties to develop , while maintaining the equal treatment in accordance with the articles I and II of the Treaty , to develop the study , the generation and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes ;
bearing in mind that according to Article IV ( 2 ) of the contract shall undertake any contract parties to facilitate the widest possible exchange of equipment , material and scientific and technological information for the peaceful use of nuclear energy , and are eligible to participate in it ;
bearing in AU@@ T that , according to the same approach , the parties who are able to further work together with other states or international organisations to further develop the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes , especially in the territory of non @-@ proliferation states , which are the party of party ;

the aim of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures such as the provisions of the part I on securing measures such as required .
the aim of the backup measures set out in this Convention is the timely discovery of the diver@@ gence of nuclear weapons of nuclear weapons and other nuclear bodies for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rent of such a branch by the risk of early detection .
in the calculation of the material statement made in Article 28 , the material keeping is used as a secure measure of fundamental importance , inter@@ locking with the spatial collap@@ ses and monitoring as an important comple@@ mentary action .
the technical conclusion of the im@@ measur@@ ations by the organization is made by an explanation , in which for each type of material , which is listed for a specified period of time , with stating the accuracy of the accuracy of the indicated values .
when carrying out your review , the organization makes for Article 3 full use of the security system of the Community .
the accounting and control system of the Community for core material according to this Convention is based on an outline in material zones .
when applying their backup measures , the community of de Proc@@ edure and measures are made in the following way and they , as far as required , see how they are conceived and ex@@ pedi@@ ently in the comple@@ mentary arrangements :
a ) a measuring system to determine the amounts of preserv@@ ative , vers@@ ed , lost , lost or otherwise taken from the stock of remote material and of stock ;
B ) the rating of the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of the measurements and the assessment of measurement certainty ;
C ) Proc@@ edure for the purpose , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of de@@ tain@@ ees and beneficiaries ;
e ) Proc@@ edure for the evaluation of accumulation of measured stocks and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which indicates the core material @-@ continu@@ ance for each material area and the changes of this collection , including the pro@@ - and out@@ puts of the material colony zone ;
( g ) A@@ mend@@ ments to ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proc@@ edure for the demo@@ lition of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the backup should not extend to material in mining or in the arch@@ ing .
B ) is Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ m material that has not yet reached the code of nuclear power process , introduced into the states , so the community of organization divi@@ des out the amount and composition of the material provided that it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves material material , which is suitable according to composition and purity for the fuel production or the is@@ ot@@ open@@ in phase , in which it is made , or will be introduced to the core material or other , in a later phase of nuclear @-@ circular @-@ down material in the states , so it is subject to the other backup measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The securing measures provided in this Convention are not authorized for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . however , the Community of Article 11 is not possible , which is subject to the recovery of nuclear material , which is temporarily impossible or desired by resi@@ du@@ es , so consult the organization and the community to each other through the use of appropriate backup measures .

if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties are supposed to remain at least one year long .
the expiry Date of a re@@ agent in flu@@ ent form according to label is at most one year after the final satisfying efficiency period .
this information on the label exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents is based on the results of the fe@@ asi@@ bility trials ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry @-@ re@@ agents are kept in an atmosphere of iner@@ ated gas or in a vacuum , while in the glass container , where it is dried , and the so locked , that no moisture can inv@@ ade .
a dry @-@ re@@ agen@@ z is allowed to lose at most 0,5 b.@@ H. his weight if it is tested through further drying via phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ ine at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm H@@ g within 24 hours .
to prevent bacterial growth , the responsible state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or with the sol@@ vents of the sol@@ vents ) added an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic if the re@@ agent with the added substance will remain the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .

the re@@ agents are in@@ different , whether in fluid form or after the recovery , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ments nor num@@ bing or visible particles .
the re@@ agents for the international exchange of re@@ agents for the blood @-@ group@@ ings should be done as not artificial , at least as long as not until an international agreement has come about a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood @-@ group@@ ies are to be distributed in such a manner and in such quantities that it is not only to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control cells .
the amount may be set in a reservoir , so that the contents will be used , if necessary , to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the production of producer collaborated on all production stages and controls of re@@ agents to re@@ group@@ ed written records .
appropriate rehear@@ s@@ als of all re@@ agents are so long been adopted by the lab , until some likelihood can be presum@@ ed , that the charge is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood @-@ re@@ agents may contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective share , the others are the necessary means to enhance the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups following the origin of their effective treatment .
this does not mean that re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents do not contain any substances of human origin .
on each single vessel is a black on white printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
