it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of m@@ elt tablets ( tablets which can dis@@ solve itself in the mouth ) , as a solution to taking ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B . wir@@ ing thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing of things that are not available ) , mis@@ trust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar disorder , a mental disorder , in which the patient man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal floods ) have alter@@ nating with periods of normal mood .
bili@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and the prevention of chronic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
injection solution is applied to rapid control of increased anxiety or behavi@@ oral disorders , when the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can be applied to the in@@ gestion or melting patient in patients who are getting the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties .
for patients , who are simultaneously taking other medicines , which are just as desired as bili@@ fy fy , the dose should be adjusted by bili@@ fy .
this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is probably used primarily as a &quot; partial &quot; player &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also ser@@ otonin ) .
this means Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser extent regarded as the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters to enable the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schizophrenia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole carries to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and their re @-@ occur is prevented .
the efficacy of bili@@ fy , to prevent the recur@@ rence of symptoms , has been studied in three studies of up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two trials of 8@@ 05 patients suffering from schizophrenia , or similar diseases , compared to a placebo over a period of two hours .
in a further study , A@@ bili@@ fy has been assessed for over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with semi @-@ operated patients , in a different study the effectiveness of bili@@ fy and placebo that have been stabili@@ zed to 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of bili@@ fy injections was made in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that were on pat@@ ched in@@ fer@@ ment , using the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the change of symptoms experienced by patients with a standard @-@ scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients suffering from treatment discussed .
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absorbed the m@@ elt @-@ coated and the solution to taking into .
in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients who received am@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms indic@@ tive anxiety than the patients who received a placebo .
in the application for treating bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy was more effective than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
bili@@ fy also fet@@ ched up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo the re @-@ emergence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was given in addition to an existing treatment .
bili@@ fy injections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms of un@@ disturbed anxiety and were similar effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side @-@ effects of bili@@ fy fy ( watched at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ pr@@ id@@ al disorders ( un@@ contro@@ ll@@ ability ) , vom@@ iting ( pun@@ ctu@@ ation ) , ob@@ scure secre@@ tion ( in@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee on Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of bili@@ fy and from moderate to heavy loads in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes discussed the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to the risks .
furthermore , the Committee on the outcome came to the outcome that the benefits of injection is increased from increased anxiety and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients suffering from schizophrenia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder when a or@@ ale therapy is not suitable to ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risks .
June 2004 the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the marketing of bili@@ fy in the whole of the European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to heavy @-@ sized episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IZ@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day at once daily regardless of meals .
an increased effectiveness at doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ W@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combin@@ therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schizophrenia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower Initi@@ al dose should be considered , if clinical conditions justify this ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duction included in the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of in@@ suffici@@ ency behaviour belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective distur@@ ban@@ ces , and has been reported in some cases following the beginning or after a change of anti @-@ psycho@@ tic therapy , also in case of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epidemi@@ ological study revealed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increased risk of suffici@@ ency with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ ac ar@@ rests ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , conditions which are used for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood @-@ printed medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ zel@@ eri@@ zed and mal@@ ign@@ y form ) .

if at one with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients treated signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms appearing on a m@@ ns , or unclear high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psycho@@ tic medicines must be reset , including AB@@ IL@@ IZ@@ Y .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with cr@@ amp@@ fan@@ try in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or states that are related to accidents .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ osis symptoms associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients , who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , was elevated mortality compared to placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the attack for unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with arith@@ me@@ z@@ ole patients treated .
hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related undes@@ irable events associated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents that provide direct comparisons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of deterioration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schizophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia , the application of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as a side @-@ effect , or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central medicinal drugs by itself over se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ agon@@ is Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resili@@ ence of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , although this effect is not considered a clin@@ ically relevant result .
in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) , AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole for 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to have other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ etine and par@@ ox@@ etine , similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions .
with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ) metabolic disease the joint application may result in high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plastic Con@@ centr@@ ates , compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ ze metabolic suppliers .
if you consider the joint gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the potential benefits should ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the potential risks to the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ eas@@ es , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar doses .
after lowering the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage given by AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be lifted to the tin levels before the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em or E@@ sc@@ it@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is given along with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies cans of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the met@@ ac@@ ism of sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ in@@ an @-@ rati@@ o ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( ov@@ ec@@ cl@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( d@@ ex@@ tro@@ user ) .
patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or getting pregnant during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the insufficient data situation for humans and due to the concerns raised in reproduction , this medicine may not be used in pregnancy , unless the possible benefits justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk to the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics patients should be warned of the patients previously , dangerous machines , including vehicles , to operate , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects occurred more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side @-@ effects below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schizophrenia - In a controlled long @-@ term study conducted over 52 weeks , patients were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total lower incidence ( 25@@ ,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ athy , d@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , compared to those treated with semi @-@ operated ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study on 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients among Ari@@ z@@ pi@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in a different controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
Ottoman episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % was charged with patients among Ari@@ gat@@ pra@@ zol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.@@ 3 % in patients with semi @-@ operating treatment .
in a different study more than 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was reported in patients with arith@@ me@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those with lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term phase over 26 weeks of placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS confirmed 2 % for patients among Ari@@ gat@@ ru@@ zol@@ - treatment , and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated to placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups , under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ ine phosph@@ ate ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ z@@ pi@@ z@@ ole patients compared to 2,@@ 0 % of patients treated to placebo .
among the side effects which can occur in connection with an anti @-@ psycho@@ tic therapy , and above their occurrence in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome and var@@ ic@@ om@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tionally or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there is no information about the effectiveness of an her@@ edi@@ fication in treating an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ ben@@ zene , but it is unlikely that hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis is used in treating an over@@ dose of use , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole shows a high plastic map@@ le .
it is believed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schizophrenia and bi@@ polar disorder on the combination of a particip@@ atory effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin m@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a antagon@@ istic effect on Ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .

current values of measuring parameters that were defined as secondary courses , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depress@@ ants scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than on holding hands .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study on 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schizophrenia , for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction in return rate , which was 34 % in the arith@@ me@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below placebo .
in a gran@@ o @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study on schizophrenia , over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients were involved and involved in the primary study of aging ( N = 18 , or 13 % of compensation patients ) compared with significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg in an average weight of approx .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo against placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with an man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior effectiveness compared to placebo .
in two Plac@@ ebo@@ x and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo over placebo over placebo over a week of placebo based on placebo or semi @-@ operated dol in week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also pointed to 12 a comparable percentage of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia on such as lithium or neck .

based on vit@@ ro @-@ studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the stretching and hydro@@ xy@@ z of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , which is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive met@@ alli@@ zation over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and about 14@@ 6 hours with &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) of metabolic disease via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the pharmaceutical kin@@ e@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , and they showed no gender @-@ based effects on a phar@@ yn@@ kin@@ e@@ tic examination .
a study @-@ specific analysis on pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tics yiel@@ ded no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic affili@@ ation or the impact of the smoking on the pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tic characteristics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ arias were similar to patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study with prob@@ atively liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of the liver function of arith@@ me@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ pi@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study comprised only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on security measurements , toxicity , toxicity , toxicity and edge @-@ performance potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data showed no special dangers to humans .
to@@ xi@@ k@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in doses or ex@@ positions that exceed maximum dosage or exposure to humans , that they have limited only limited or no meaning for the clinical use .

the efficacy of abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a main study , where 4@@ 60 women participated with metastatic breast cancer , three quarters of which had previously received an Anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine .
the effect of my@@ x@@ ane ( in all@@ ot@@ or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drug drug ( given in combination with other medicines used to reduce side effects ) .
in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 with abra@@ x@@ ane patients treated patients to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients , who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines .
consider only the patients treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between efficacy indicators such as time and worsen@@ ing of disease and survival .
in contrast , in patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators that my@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines .
it may also not be used in patients who are breastfeeding or before the treatment have low neut@@ ro@@ ast numbers in the blood .
the Committee on Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) found that my@@ x@@ ane in patients , where the first treatment is no longer acceptable , more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines has not been given to other drugs to reduce side @-@ effects .
January 2008 the European Commission granted sub@@ missions Bio@@ Science Limited for a permit for the marketing of my@@ x@@ ane in the whole of the European Union .

the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed needs to be initiated under the supervision of a physician , who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the drug is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to let their own bleeding ma@@ iled , Ab@@ se@@ amed in a v@@ ene is inj@@ ected .
injection can also be made by the patient or its super@@ visor , provided that they have obtained an appropriate guide .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients who receive an chemotherapy , the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ es are always in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per Dec@@ ath@@ ites at adults or between 9.@@ 5 and 11 g / d@@ l with children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be controlled before treatment to ensure that no lack of water exists , and iron supplements should be given during the entire treatment .
in patients who receive an chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems a an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an er@@ y@@ thropo@@ i@@ et@@ inal deficiency or by att@@ aching the body to not sufficiently address the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
Er@@ y@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used in front of operations to increase the number of red blood cells , thereby reducing the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell that uses a gene ( DNA ) that adap@@ ts it to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was reported in administration as an injection in a v@@ ein in the context of a main study of 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from a kidney problems caused by kidney problems , with the reference practitioner .
all of the patients participating in this study had been in@@ ex@@ iled for at least eight weeks to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ene before they were either applied to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indi@@ indicator of the effectiveness was the variation of the h@@ exag@@ onal difference between the beginning of the study and the period period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also laid out the results of a study , in which the effects of under the skin su@@ pr@@ amed Ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ es of patients received on Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained , in the same degree as for those patients who continued to obtain E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
by comparison , the patients , who continued to obtain E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / d@@ l of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / d@@ l .
the com@@ mon@@ est side @-@ effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) like sudden , ste@@ eping mig@@ r@@ se head@@ ache and confusion .
retri@@ eval should not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
ab@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this caused by no allergic reactions .
the Committee on Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that for sec@@ es@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union of detection was provided that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which provides Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide for the medical staff in all member states information , including information about the safety of the drug .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following illnesses : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( an illness that p@@ ens the bone ) both in women after men@@ opause and men .
it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone qu@@ arri@@ es ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a sligh@@ test hip outbreak ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of a bone , a sickness that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients should take with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with boun@@ cers should be obtained before the first in@@ fusion a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by inj@@ ecting in a muscle .
the administration of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( funds against inflammation ) just after the application of acet@@ ate can reduce the symptoms in the three days following the in@@ fusion of symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headaches .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
since the ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sia is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data collection was collected for zom@@ eta to assess Ac@@ ad@@ sta .
during the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis and the number of verteb@@ rates and hip frac@@ tures have been studied over a period of three years .
the second study comprised 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis for more than 50 years , recently suffered an undes@@ irable frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures has been studied over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( a different bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indi@@ indicator of the effectiveness was whether the salary of the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase in the Ser@@ um ( an enzyme that reduces bone substance ) in the blood and decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women the risk of verteb@@ rates was reduced to patients under Ac@@ ad@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) over a period of three years compared to the patients suffering from placebo by 70 % .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis drug ) with those among placebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures has been reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with boun@@ cers , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ ad@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 out of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side @-@ effects of acet@@ one appear within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeti@@ tive in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ d , or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of other constitu@@ ents .
as with all Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients are subject to the risk of kidney disease , reactions at the in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose , ( die of bone tissue ) in j@@ aw@@ s .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta presents information material for physicians who pres@@ cribe the Ac@@ la@@ sta in the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis to use the indication of how to apply the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the unwanted effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor .

for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip , the administration of the In@@ fusion is recommended two or more weeks according to the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , acet@@ one should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
following the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ ad@@ sta a long tail @-@ zero period has been observed in patients responding to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to verify in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of acet@@ one . ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic scent , an Initi@@ al dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 was derived from 50,000 or in@@ tra @-@ muscular vitamin D in front of the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the incidence of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ ad@@ sta can be reduced by gift of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen in short after application of acet@@ el@@ sta .
patients with kidney disease ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended , as limited clinical experience exist for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary , since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years of age , since data is missing to the im@@ memorial and effectiveness .
Ac@@ lo@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as for these patient population has only limited clinical experience .
an pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia is in the beginning of therapy with acet@@ one by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
because of the quick setup of the effect of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ d on the bone structure , a temporary to develop occasionally over@@ ly symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ ad@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to verify in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of acet@@ one . ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer ( cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , poor harmon@@ ics ) should be assessed before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental treatment with appropriate correc@@ tive dental treatment .
for patients who require dental ass@@ aults , no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk to oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the jaw area .
clinical evaluation by the responsible physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefits risk assessment .
the incidence of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ ad@@ sta can be reduced by gift of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen in short after application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of as serious side @-@ effect reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation was increased in patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( P@@ FT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Frac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall prevalence of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation between acet@@ el@@ sta ( 2,@@ 6 % ) and placebo ( 2,@@ 1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) undes@@ irable drugs effects are listed in chart 1 .
kidney disease @-@ disorder Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ d has been associated with kidney dys@@ functions that is referred to as the decrease of kidney function ( i.e. an increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( year before administration measured ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited kidney function were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis for three years between the action Tax and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift has been observed at 1.8 percent of patients treated with acet@@ one @-@ treated patients compared to 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated to placebo .
based on the assessment of the laboratory conditions , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels , which below the normal variation @-@ area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , at 2.3 % of patients treated with acet@@ el@@ sta in a large clinical study patients treated patients treated in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies handled patients .
all patients received supple@@ mental adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in study on avoidance of clinical trials after infection and in the tro@@ l@@ ley@@ bus studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoiding clinical trials , the vitamin D mirror was not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an Initi@@ al dose of vitamin D in front of the administration of Ac@@ ad@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ ent in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions at the in@@ fusion place , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reports ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the jaw area has been mostly treated mainly in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the max@@ il@@ ar area ) reported with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including customs clear@@ ance .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports relates to cancer patients following tooth decay or other dental ass@@ aults .

effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT @-@ study increased the acet@@ D treatment compared to placebo treatment the BM@@ D on the total th@@ as@@ ons and th@@ ats as at all times .
the Ac@@ ad@@ sta treatment performed more than 24 months in comparison to placebo treatment at an increase in the BM@@ D by 5.2 % at the total of 4.@@ 3 % on the th@@ aw@@ ning hour .
clinical effectiveness in males In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT @-@ study were random@@ ized 50@@ 8 men and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to reduce a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; incidence of clinical trials amoun@@ ted to 7.5 % in acet@@ one @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % on placebo .
in another study by men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M2@@ 30@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of acet@@ one was referred to as weekly administration of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at to the percentage change in the steering verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months as compared to the initial value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the Kno@@ chens ac@@ la@@ sta was investigated on patient care and patients at the age of 30 with radi@@ ological certi@@ fications , especially light @-@ like heavy Ph@@ osph@@ ates ( mean ser@@ um @-@ mirror of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase in accordance with the 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ 7@@ ght@@ age @-@ specific upper standard for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg customs ic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg , mic@@ ron@@ utri@@ d once daily during 2 months was detected in two six @-@ month comparison studies .
the combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease of the pain and pain relief compared to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients , which at the end of the six month &apos;s main study were classified as reset ( upon the therapy ) , were able to be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 with ac@@ lo@@ sta and the 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was in 141 of the patients treated with Ac@@ ad@@ sta , compared to 71 of the patients treated with risk @-@ treated patients , are maintained during a mid @-@ period of follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after application .
unique and multi @-@ time 5 and 15 minutes of constant In@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg customs ic acid in 64 patients took the following pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tic data that proved to be dose @-@ independent .
thereafter the Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel rapidly took off at &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the peak value .
rapid bi@@ ph@@ as@@ hic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life @-@ times ½ α @-@ 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a lengthy elimination phase with termin@@ ating elimination of elimination of ½ g 14@@ 6 hours .
the early stages of development ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) represent probably the rapid cancellation in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion about the kidneys .
in the first 24 h you can find 39 ± 16 % of a given dose in urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the overall body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of customs clear@@ ance concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma con@@ centric against time ) .
a diminished clearing of by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ systems metabo@@ li@@ zed substances is unlikely , because Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ d will not be metabo@@ li@@ zed when humans are not metabolic and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible , fuel @-@ dependent in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The renal Clear@@ ance of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid cor@@ relate with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and amoun@@ ted to 64 patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
it follows that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a numer@@ ical kidney disease is down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance until 35 ml / min does not require dosage adjustment of customs clear@@ ance .
since serious kidney disease ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only have limited data , are no statements made for this population .
acute toxicity The highest non @-@ effective intraven@@ ous single dose amoun@@ ted to mice 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0,@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies in dogs were sol@@ dered of 1.@@ 0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ times the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered for a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ ale influ@@ encing .

acquiring blood levels of sex hormones , mainly estrogen , are formed from Andro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in males .
with the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone construction takes place too fast , and new bone material is built un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alized the bone structure , thereby creating a normal bone formation and thus gives strength to the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or have to undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ ad@@ sta .
in application of Ac@@ la@@ sia with other medicines Please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or the nursing staff if you have taken other medicines / apply and applied recently , even if it is not prescription pharmaceuticals .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know whether you are taking drugs of which you are aware of the kidneys .
when applying Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and drinks you are worried that you take sufficient fluid in line with the instructions of your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year which is given to you by your physician or the care staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hips , is recommended to make administration of acet@@ one two or more weeks according to the operative care of the injection .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg that is given to you by your physician or the care staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
as Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you will possibly need additional dose only after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium levels in your blood in time after in@@ fusion is not too low .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get ac@@ lo@@ sta can last more than a year , and your doctor will inform you when you need a new treatment .
if the administration of the Ac@@ la@@ sta miss Set@@ ting you immediately with your doctor or hospital in order to arrange a new date .
before ending the therapy with Ac@@ ad@@ sta case you consider ending the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta considering you take your next doctor &apos;s test and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects linked to the first in@@ fusion are very often appear ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but after the subsequent in@@ fusion are less frequent .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ ache , appear within the first three days of the administration of acet@@ cla@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms .

inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or the nursing staff if any of the listed side effects you have significantly affected or you notice adverse reactions that are not listed in this usage information .
if the drug is not used immediately , the user is responsible for storage and conditions of use until the application ; usually , 24 hours at 2 ° C up to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic scent , the in@@ fusion of acet@@ one is recommended two or more weeks according to the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after administration of ac@@ lo@@ sta , patients need to be supplied sufficiently with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
because of the quick setup of the effect of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y on the bone construction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic of consecutive , hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia can develop whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of acet@@ on@@ sta .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of acet@@ one .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures , a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 was derived from 50,000 or in@@ tra @-@ muscular vitamin D in front of the in@@ fusion of acet@@ el@@ sta .

a summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public License Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which is explained as the studies carried out by the Human Rights Committee ( CH@@ MP ) in order to access recommendations on the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos are used for the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mono@@ therapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where Met@@ mold ( a Di@@ abet@@ es@@ medi@@ a@@ chemotherapy ) is not used .
it can additionally be applied to met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially overweight patients ) using met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ onic fuel or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ ph@@ onic treatment or insulin can be maintained , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced the dose of sul@@ ph@@ onic fuel or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s physical should be better recycled and the blood sugar is reduced to which type @-@ 2 diabetes can be better set .
more than 1 400 patients were examined the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ onic fuel , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or placebo .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar values were lowered by 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ a study , the effect of an additional gift of account for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ onic nutrient in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values were 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo resulted in lowering of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin is examined in 2@@ 89 patients , patients requiring action in addition to insulin , a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took additional placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos are visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist ( diminished sensitivity to stim@@ uli ) .
ac@@ tos may not be used in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis ( high ket@@ one mirror - acid@@ sp@@ ar ) - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos are in part of a mon@@ otherapy ( in the only use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients , where Met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
Oktober 2000 divided the European Commission to take charge of Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the marketing of Ac@@ tos in the whole of the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to white , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the markings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate and in@@ appropriate to those metals , due to contra@@ indications or in@@ toler@@ ability ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age are no data available , so the use in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering through the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should begin the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose of dose .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain or oils , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain and oils , when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing macro@@ vas@@ cular disease has been performed .
this study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output levels ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror is lifted up to the 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , liver enzymes are as soon as possible to control .
in case a patient symptoms develops , that point to a hepati@@ c dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , super@@ fici@@ ency , fatigue , loss of appetite , and / or darker hard@@ n , the liver enzymes are to be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient will be continued with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be led to the prec@@ urs@@ ors of the Laboratory parameters of the clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent wei@@ ghting has been shown , which can be stir@@ red from fats and in some cases it is connected to a fluid @-@ re@@ tention .

similar changes have been observed in comparative @-@ controlled trials by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % ) and to a lesser extent also in patients taking sul@@ ph@@ onic soli@@ ds and insulin ( relative reduction of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ atology 7.@@ 2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin , in patients , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is considered oral two or three @-@ com@@ po@@ al therapy with a sul@@ ph@@ onic compound or as a two @-@ type combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
after the launch of the market it was reported in the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ ol@@ ites In@@ dies , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , above the appearance or a deterioration of a diabe@@ tic bro@@ o@@ ction with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the appearance of mac@@ ular oils if patients report on failures of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic evaluation should be considered .

the fra@@ ined questionn@@ aires was 1.9 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years with the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the pro@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years of research of cardiovascular medicine , frac@@ tures stood at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 0.5 mi / 0.5 % ; 0.5 mi / 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
the patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is processed ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies for examining the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of diges@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ o@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are metabo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ters do not expect .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Mi@@ ros@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ k@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ k@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 in@@ duction ) resulted in a reduction of AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one diminished the hyp@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance to the mother &apos;s mother and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the federal growth .

these lead to a tran@@ sit@@ ing change of Tur@@ g@@ ors and the fraction of the lens , as they will also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the AL@@ T asc@@ ents occurred across the thre@@ e@@ fold limit at the normal range , but less often than placebo , but less often than in comparison between met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ ph@@ onic soli@@ ds .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing macro@@ vas@@ cular disease the incidence of a severe heart failure was reported under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 1.6 % higher than placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or bz@@ w .
since the launch of the market it was rarely reported via heart failure , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
it was conducted a summary analysis of messages of undes@@ irable events concerning bone bro@@ o@@ ds from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
in the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro@@ active study , frac@@ tures stood at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of the patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days have no symptoms encountered .
pic@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( per@@ ox@@ ic pro@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , which leads at the animal model to an increased insulin @-@ sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peri@@ pher@@ al glucose level in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to examine the time up to the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the treatment the therapy has been checked ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a plac@@ ements controlled study about 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three @-@ month optimization phase with insulin , were random@@ ized to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients that still only received insulin ; a reduction in insulin of insulin in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one group was observed .

the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mono@@ gram with 45 mg / placebo ( placebo ) has been evaluated in a small , 18 weeks investigation by type @-@ 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials , a reduction of the overall ser@@ um tri@@ gl@@ yp@@ t@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as neg@@ li@@ ly , however clin@@ ically not@@ ated significantly increased LD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels .

in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not only visit the so@@ ber tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the hepati@@ c tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients were random@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing macro@@ vas@@ cular disease in groups , which received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
after oral use Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one gets absorbed quickly , with the top @-@ concentration at un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in the plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution from M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness in such a triple the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interactions studies could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ o@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ k@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 in@@ duction ) or using Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ k@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 in@@ duction ) and lowers the plas@@ mas@@ concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ active mark@@ ers Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mark@@ er was found mainly in the folded ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the res@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination period of un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is at the age of 5 @-@ 6 hours , and that of the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma @-@ Con@@ centr@@ ations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced renal function lower than in healthy subjects , but contrasts with the instal@@ ments of the or@@ alen Clear@@ ance of the mother &apos;s stance .

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e has been involved in a total of 2@@ 94 patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as does not produce insulin , and type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin in effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ) was measured after 12 weeks , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e led to the removal of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ mirror , which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were similarly severe as with another human@@ eness .
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e should not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human@@ eness ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
moreover , the cans of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that may affect the blood sugar ( the full list is the package price ) .
the Committee on Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e ob@@ ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e in the whole of the European Union .
mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily , if a quick initial effect is desired with a longer lasting effect .
the injection @-@ needle must be held at least 6 seconds long under the skin to make sure the total dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar set out clearly improved by an increased insulin treatment , can be altered by hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ War@@ n@@ osis symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , mark ( manufacturers ) , insulin ( etc . ) , type of insulin ( etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin or insulin ) can cause a change in the dosage .
if a dosage adjustment is needed when changing to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e , it can be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion .
some patients participating in hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change of animal in human insulin , reported that early War@@ n@@ symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia had been less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling , the patient should go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such travel may lead to that insulin and meals must be used or taken at other times .
the physician must therefore take into account possible interactions with the treatment and always ask for patients such as medicines .
4 thro@@ ws hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , which can occur in a not sufficiently controlled di@@ abet@@ es@@ therapy , increase the risk of abnorm@@ alities and fruit pul@@ p@@ d in uter@@ o .

however , a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be developed in stages : • Un@@ light hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias can be treated by the or@@ ale gas supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have trau@@ ma sugar , cand@@ y , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • heav@@ iness of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias are treated with a in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.@@ 0 mg ) by a proven aid person or is given by glucose , intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the activity is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active duration is up to 24 hours .
R@@ or@@ ption The Res@@ or@@ gement profile is established in it , that it is a mix of insulin products with a faster and / hesit@@ ant resp@@ ite .
a number of sp@@ as ( hydro@@ lys@@ ine ) places on the human insulin molecule has been considered ; none of those caused by the spl@@ itting of the metabol@@ ites is active .

this document is a summary of the European Public License Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which is explained as the studies carried out by the Human Rights Committee ( CH@@ MP ) in order to access recommendations on the use of the medicine .
the pharmac@@ o@@ tional effective part of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id , insulin is human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced with the method of so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology &quot; :
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 86 68 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ Regulation ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 86 68 E @-@ mail : email @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ throughout the E@@ MEA is , How was Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id examined ?
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ide must not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
moreover , the cans of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ide must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that may affect the blood sugar .
October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ide in the whole of the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first of all , the amount of insulin is to be re@@ trac@@ ed , then the amount of insulin is caused .
3 If a dosage adjustment is required for patients with a dosage adjustment , it may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion .
before travelling , the patient should go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such travel may lead to that insulin and meals must be used or taken at other times .
5 General diseases and complaints at the administration level occasionally - Local Ac@@ sensitive approach to the inj@@ ecting location Dur@@ ing the insulin treatment can occur local hyper@@ sensitivity ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ om at the injection ) .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for treating hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients demonstrated that a intraven@@ ous activity induced by intraven@@ ous in@@ tr@@ ap@@ id ( blood sugar 4.@@ 4 - 6,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced the mortality rate by 42 % ( 8 % compared to 4.@@ 6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the activity is reached within 1,5 to 3.5 hours and the total active duration is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tic profile from Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adolescents ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited , however , the assumption that the pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tic profile with children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .
in@@ fusion systems with ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ide in concentrations of 0.@@ 05 % / ml - 1.@@ 0 - / ml of insulin in the in@@ fusion fluids , 5 % D glucose and 10 % glow , glucose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l pot@@ assi@@ um chlori@@ de are stable in use of in@@ fusion bags made of poly@@ propylene at room temperature 24 hours long .
11 If a dosage adjustment is needed when changing to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id , this can be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion .
before travelling , the patient should go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such travel may lead to that insulin and meals must be used or taken at other times .

if the ureth@@ ral chan@@ gel increases after two to four weeks still more than 6 mg per de@@ an , the dose can be increased once daily 120 mg every day .
during the first treatment months , tox@@ ics may still occur ; therefore it is recommended that patients take at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic still further medicines to the prevention of poison attacks .
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients suffering from a transplan@@ tation because it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , participating in the 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared with the one placebo ( hypo@@ thal@@ kam@@ ents ) and of al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared a year to 7@@ 62 patients compared with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indi@@ indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ureth@@ ral chan@@ gels had fallen into the blood during the last three measurements under 6 mg / d@@ l .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) patients , the aden@@ ur@@ ic participated in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who participated in the last three measurements in the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ l .
compared to that , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( watched at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea ( nau@@ sea ) , skin rash and abnormal liver values .
particularly in patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ tery disease may possibly also affect an increased risk of certain side @-@ effects which affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the blood reduction in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but there could also be a higher risk of side @-@ effects associated with the heart and the blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia in diseases , which have already led to ur@@ at@@ abl@@ ag@@ ings ( including one out of the health @-@ history known or current present @-@ by @-@ junction and / or a arthritis ) .
if the ser@@ um acid sa@@ ils after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still amounts &gt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , can be considered a dosage increased to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , the effectiveness and safety have so far not been completely investigated ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents because there are no experiences in children and young people , the use of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at will not be recommended in this patient group .
organ recept@@ ors As there are no experiences at Organ@@ iz@@ ers recei@@ vers , the application of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at will not be recommended in this patient group ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease is recommended in patients with local cardi@@ ac disease or de@@ compression cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , treatment with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at will not be recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ aci@@ dic medicines , it can come to a acute toxicity in the treatment of treatment , because by lowering the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ ur@@ ism at first ur@@ acid re@@ abl@@ ag@@ ons can be mobil@@ ised in the tissue .

with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy point was at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patient .
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of ser@@ um @-@ acid @-@ con@@ greg@@ ations in subjects , irrespective of their renal function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe renal function ) .
primary termin@@ us in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um har@@ n@@ c acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l About 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ eline ) had a ser@@ um har@@ n@@ c acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l .
the data collected in two years was reported that the long term reduction of ser@@ um vessels yiel@@ ded to &lt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) caused by the incidence of incidence of poison gas ( i.e. , more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a g@@ nat@@ s ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the pl@@ y@@ wood size , which resulted in 54 % of the patient with a complete dis@@ appearing until month 24 .
increased test values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.@@ 8 % ) and also received in patients suffering from the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE will be used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder in which the bones are brood @-@ related ) in women after men@@ opause , where a risk exists for a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or adding other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
to avoid a irritation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient is allowed to take up after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in drugs which are authorised in the European Union , the company submitted data to date from earlier studies and the published literature .
the company also led a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding increase of vitamin D .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with the patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , lower ( 11 % ) than those who took exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data that in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE included Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose to be exactly the dose which is needed to prevent bone loss .

in the two @-@ year extension of these studies the wor@@ ship@@ ments of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ l@@ ter continues to maintain ; also the BM@@ D of fem@@ ur and the whole body was maintained .
fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ ebo@@ at studies where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily ) was taken with either 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the appearance of at least one new verteb@@ rates by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy and the treatment of transp@@ l@@ ant patients should arrange this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the systemic exposure to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this can lead to transp@@ ir@@ regul@@ ations or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immune response .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or of the ré@@ g@@ ime only should be carried out under the eng@@ masch@@ ige control of an experienced medical device ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustment has to be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage given by Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in case of blood @-@ reflection ( see below &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f on eag@@ vag@@ ra@@ f you should be monitored by tactics in front of the conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on day 4 the systemic exposure was measured , measured as a reflection , with both form@@ ulations in both ni@@ gh@@ tly and le@@ ased patients .
careful and repe@@ atable controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ valley levels are recommended during the first two weeks after the transp@@ l@@ ant under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure to the immediate transp@@ l@@ ant phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adjustment of the vaginal process can take several days until the ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first post@@ operative phase does not allow any oral intake of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentr@@ ates for creating an in@@ fusion solution ) using a dose of approx .

further dos@@ ages can be later required since the pharmaceutical co@@ kin@@ e@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the transp@@ l@@ ant .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation prophy@@ la@@ xis of Tran@@ splan@@ tat@@ too rep@@ ul@@ sion . or@@ ale Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily Gift in the morning .
dosage recommen@@ ding - changing from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f must be converted to a Tran@@ gra@@ f recept@@ or of twice daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules upon a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , this adjustment has in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transp@@ l@@ ant after a shift from other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f once daily needs to start the treatment with each dose transp@@ l@@ ant for the prophy@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tion transp@@ ires .
coron@@ ary heart transp@@ l@@ ant with adult patients who are adapted to ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is an oral Initi@@ al dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily in the morning .
other transp@@ ires , although there are no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f in pul@@ mon@@ o- , pan@@ car@@ bons and col@@ on transplan@@ ted patients , arrived at a oral Initi@@ al dose of 0.1 mg / kg / day and at intestinal flu@@ xes in a oral Initi@@ al dose of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / day .
dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations in specific patient @-@ groups patients with reduced liver function Z@@ ur maintenance of blood @-@ reporting in the mach@@ ined area may be in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a reduction of dose required .
patients with reduced renal function As kidney function does not affect the pharmaceutical kin@@ e@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be understood that a dosage adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential as by Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful supervision of kidney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um@@ bri@@ at@@ in@@ ating mirror , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ fer@@ ance and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary stream ) is recommended .
switching of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f in the conversion of a cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in on a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the down levels in the whole blu@@ t The dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in the individual case with the assimil@@ ation of attorney @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us consistency checks .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley levels during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant , followed by perio@@ dic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after re@@ switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f on no@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , dosage adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or at the simultaneous application of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ full @-@ blood @-@ concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
because Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with low Clear@@ ance , adjustments to the dose can take several days until the ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical trials can conclude that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the slow@@ s down in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml is not exceed .
in clinical practice , the body levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood blood within the first time after liver transplan@@ tations are usually carried out in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with car@@ cin@@ ated patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent continuation of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac disease patients were usually used blood @-@ centr@@ ations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to serious unwanted events , including transp@@ l@@ apping or other side effects which may occur in the result of tac@@ t@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or exposure .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or of the ré@@ g@@ ime only should be carried out under the eng@@ masch@@ ige control of an experienced medical device ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 Z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transp@@ l@@ ism , which are proven to be used in relation to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants as therapies @-@ resistant , are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
for prophy@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ ts at adult heart transp@@ ires and transp@@ ires in childhood @-@ age are still not a clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of vaginal formulation .
because of possible interactions formed to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ ine levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements containing Johann@@ is@@ k@@ wee@@ ds ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) contain , or other pesti@@ cides during a treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentrations in the blood commanded , since the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to severe fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , he was regarded as a cardi@@ om@@ yo@@ path@@ ia ex@@ termin@@ ation@@ - or Sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ trop@@ hia , which therefore can occur even under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
additional factors that increase the risk of such clin@@ ically distur@@ ban@@ ces are an already existing heart suffer , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , hydr@@ ation and hydr@@ ation .
as with other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to possible risk mal@@ ign@@ ant skin lesi@@ ons by means of suitable clothing or use of a solar protection by means of a high protective factor .
if patients , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us take , Sympt@@ oms for Pr@@ es like headaches , changed consciousness levels , cr@@ amps and visual dys@@ functions should show a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.g. .
since Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f Hart@@ ac@@ kles , re@@ tar@@ ded , lac@@ t@@ ose veins , is offered in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary Gal@@ ac@@ t@@ ose @-@ intolerance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ Gal@@ ac@@ t@@ ose @-@ painting absorption special care .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies which are known as inhibit@@ or or in@@ duction by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reduce the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or decrease it .
it is therefore advised to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels at the simultaneous gift of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain ev@@ enly concentrations as per ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction of interaction was created with an@@ tim@@ y@@ co@@ tics such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid of Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ esters ( z ) .
pharmaceuticals studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly consists of the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by inhibit@@ or of the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal metabolism .
up@@ do@@ si@@ zed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as is used for acute waste actions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; hence the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that will metabo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 metabo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us down the clearing of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills and thus can increase the hormone exposure , decisions are made especially careful in decisions about recep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal testing have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially reduce the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ time .
the results of a small number of examinations in transp@@ l@@ ant patients do not provide any indication that at Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants have raised a higher risk of adverse events relating to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
at uter@@ o exposure , a surveillance of the new@@ bor@@ ns is recommended for possible damaging effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
it is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ kal@@ emia of the new@@ bor@@ ns ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the very effective profile of immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants can often be defined precisely because of the under@@ p@@ aging of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a multitude of other medicines .

Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( caused by the lack of factor VIII , con@@ genital war@@ time disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application shall apply to it , if Adv@@ ate is applied to the treatment of bleeding or preventing blood cancers at surgical intervention .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from an factor of VIII deficiency that causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems like bleeding in the joints , muscles , or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but by a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell that uses a gene ( DNA ) that adap@@ ts it to the formation of human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is a different legal medicine approved in the European Union , but it is similar , but it does not contain protein to human or animal origin .
in three additional studies , patients with severe to moderate au@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under six years of age , the use of the drug was evaluated in the prevention of bleeding and for surgical intervention .
in the main study the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate was evaluated in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ t@@ sep@@ ta with &apos; excellent &apos; or &apos; good &apos; .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( watched at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headaches , py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies opposite factor VIII .
advoc@@ acy may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human being factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other components .
March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG granted approval for the marketing of Adv@@ ate in the whole of the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution treatment are according to the severity of the factor VIII @-@ lack , according to the place and extent of blood @-@ blood and the clinical state of the patient .
in the following hem@@ mor@@ r@@ ha@@ gical events the factor of VIII activity in the relevant period does not sink under the indicated plastic ar@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel ( in % of the standard or in that - / d@@ l ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment will be removed .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeating the risk to the patient .
during the treatment process , the required dose and frequency of injections will be an appropriate determining factor by the VIII @-@ plastic surgery .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ expect@@ ancy .
3 prophy@@ la@@ xis Z@@ ur long @-@ term prophy@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be treated doses between 20 and 40 by factor VIII per kg of body weight at intervals of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII - Plas@@ ma@@ gen is not achieved , or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be conducted to prove a inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor of VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic interventions must be elsewhere .
the instruction speed should be directed after termination of the patient , whereby a maximum injection of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutral antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against a factor VIII is a known comp@@ action in the treatment of patients with Hä@@ m@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ bo@@ ag@@ atorial activity of factor VIII below immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk to develop inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the scale of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure stage is the largest one and dependent on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure and an@@ am@@ nes@@ sus known inhibit@@ ors , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low@@ g@@ ti@@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare appearance of the Hä@@ m@@ ophi@@ lia A among women are about applying an factor VIII during pregnancy and breastfeeding has no experience whatsoever .
the number of patients charged with the greatest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors to factor VIII ( 5 patients ) which had previously shown a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headaches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , is not known ( incidence when available data is not transfer@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) calculated and the un@@ anticipated waste of the blood cl@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII : post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ operative day ) in a patient under constant A@@ DV@@ ATE In@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained during the whole period and both the factor of VI@@ II@@ - Spiegel in the plasma as well as the clearing @-@ rate showed sufficient value on the 15th of post@@ operative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE an 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed he@@ avier and moderate oc@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII &lt; 2 % ) and previous exposure to the VI@@ II@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ate ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2,@@ 4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition to none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of 6 years and diagnosed hard to medium @-@ sized hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII &lt; 2 % ) after previous exposure to the VI@@ II@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ate ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
in the previously un@@ treated patients of an ongoing clinical study , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors against a factor of VIII .
the immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibody ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of the antibody against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , otherwise however , no signs or symptoms encountered on an allergic reaction or a hyper@@ sensitivity .

based on the data available since first of the first @-@ line data , the CH@@ MP opinion has been evaluated positively , but considering that the safety profile should be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP is on the basis of the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which requires a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the admission @-@ owner should apply for another period in five years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited officially distributed to the Committee on Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company res@@ igns its application for approval for the marketing of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
usually , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissues that connect other structures in the body , surrounds and leans ) .
it is a type of virus that has been modified genetically modified to carry a gene in the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been changed so that there cannot be copies of himself , and therefore cannot cause any infections in human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the canc@@ er@@ ous cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 Protein , which is formed from the un@@ broken in the human body existing p@@ 53 @-@ gene , normally bears the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , where the p@@ 53 @-@ gene def@@ ective is , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company submitted data from a study involving a patient , at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer in the area of the under@@ mining , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had informed the answers of the company &apos;s questions , there were still some questions un@@ solved .
based on the assessment of the initial documentation , the CH@@ MP gives a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
in the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not proven that an injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore takes advantage of the patient .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug , in the body , the way of administration as well as the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not proven sufficient that Adv@@ oc@@ can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the Company did not inform the CH@@ MP , whether the withdrawal may have consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compound &quot; programs with Adv@@ enti@@ in .
&quot; changing foods &quot; means that the tablets are so combined that one of the effective components immediately and the other is being released over a few hours .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze is used for treating the symptoms of seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , due to an allergy to pol@@ len prot@@ ru@@ ed inflammation of the nose @-@ way ) in patients with nas@@ al nose ( clo@@ th@@ ed nose ) .
for adults and adolescents 12 years of age , the recommended dose of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and end as soon as the symptoms , above all the swelling of the nose @-@ s@@ skin ( clo@@ th@@ ed nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug can be dis@@ connected to the sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main working conditions were the changes in severity of hay@@ fever fever , which were reported by the patients prior to treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients carried out their symptoms all 12 hours in a journal and evaluated with a standard scale as difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when considering all ha@@ y symptoms , except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patient reported the aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze received over a decrease of the symptoms by 4@@ 6.@@ 0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % compared to the patients that took Pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin alone .
if only the swelling of the nose @-@ s@@ ander was seen , the patients showed a relie@@ ving of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % against 26@@ ,@@ 7 % in patients who took des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze ( watched at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , cardi@@ yn@@ gi@@ tis , psych@@ omot@@ or , psych@@ omot@@ or , ob@@ struction , headaches , ti@@ redness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin or any of the other components , versus ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another medicine for treating allergies ) are not used .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze is also not used in patients who suffer from a bot@@ t@@ angle glau@@ coma ( higher eye pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular diseases , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension caused by the thy@@ ro@@ id ) or have had a risk for an adol@@ escent stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission ( SP Europe granted approval for the marketing of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze ) within the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is to swal@@ low it in the whole ( i.e. without dis@@ integrating or chew@@ ing ) .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the failure of data to un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after lowering the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the time of use on 10 days , as for long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin can decrease with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cos@@ as in the upper brea@@ ths , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy .
as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients suffering with an mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks after the completion of such a therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity in combination with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors , per@@ go@@ id , l@@ is@@ kan , Er@@ go@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ con@@ ges@@ ic acid , phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ lep@@ hr@@ ine , Ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ oline , etc . ) .
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy has not been reviewed for this patient collective , and the data are not sufficient for speaking relevant recommendations for dosage .
the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze has not been tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data are not sufficient for speaking relevant recommendations for dosage .
patients need to be informed about the treatment performed in a hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or p@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , heart rhythms , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as headaches or a strengthening of headaches ) .
in treating the following patient groups , patients are advised of caution : • Pati@@ alis patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dium in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder or bron@@ chi@@ val@@ m in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze is to prevent at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ologically tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka can otherwise inhi@@ bit positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce their extent .
however , within the framework of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the Plas@@ ma@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or testing could not be significant differences between the patients with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and those treated with placebo patients irrespective of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme performed for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in autonomous enzyme has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be ruled out .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the invali@@ dity of the use of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed to take experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , no increase in frequency of abnorm@@ alities compared to the frequency of normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals have not always been transmitted to humans , and because of the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ c characteristics of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy .
however , patients should be elu@@ ci@@ dated about that in very rare cases it may come to a ben@@ om@@ eness that may lead to upper lim@@ b impair@@ ment or ability to operate machinery .
symptoms can vary between a c@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , Ap@@ no@@ e , diminished mental attention , Zy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collision ) and a c@@ NS @-@ stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ) with possible let@@ ins .
headaches , anxiety , frigh@@ tening Mi@@ ktion , muscle weakness , and increased muscle tone , euph@@ oria , arousal , respir@@ ation , thirst , vom@@ iting , pre@@ di@@ mental pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , ag@@ grav@@ ie , visual dys@@ functions and hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
a c@@ NS @-@ stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , pe@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ rigi@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the inhi@@ bitions of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ air cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the child disease P @-@ sel@@ tin on endo@@ th@@ el@@ cells .
with an individual dose survey with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of aviation , including rein@@ forcement of subjective bats or the tasks connected with the fly .
controlled clinical trials were found in the recommended dosage of 5 mg every day for increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness compared to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further like@@ able effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of a TI@@ NS arousal .
it took 1,@@ 2@@ 48 patients at the age between 12 and 78 years with seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients received their aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine intermediate efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total cor@@ es for symptoms symptoms , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ et over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swe@@ eping effect , determined by the nose @-@ loop , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .

A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies at seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number , and size of the p@@ add@@ ling , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance at the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment .
further studies were presented to prove that the body is the sy@@ rup to take the solution to the inser@@ tion and melting clothes in the same way as the tablets and the use in children is harmless .
in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were considered , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg as@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average absorption of symptom ( symptom score ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients that received a placebo .
in the two studies in ur@@ tic@@ aria , the withdrawal of the symptom was after six @-@ week treatment with as@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % compared to placebo patients treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or any of the other components .

one tablet once daily , with a or without a meal , for relie@@ ving the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see below 5.1 ) .
there are limited clinical studies for efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in teenagers from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be completed according to the previous disease process and may end after lowering the symptoms and may be resum@@ ed at their re @-@ occur .
with the pers@@ isting aller@@ genic rh@@ initi@@ s ( incidence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks ) patients may be recommended to patients during the course of our @-@ term treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have been observed in clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study the effects of alcohol and alcohol was not ampli@@ fied by alcohol influence ( see below 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be elu@@ ci@@ dated about that in very rare cases it may come to ben@@ om@@ men@@ ities , which may lead to upper lim@@ b impair@@ ment or ability to operate machinery .
in clinical studies in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg every day 3 % more side @-@ effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , as in patients treated with placebo .
the most common incidents that were more common than on placebo were we@@ ar@@ iness ( 1,2 % ) , oral tu@@ ps ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and headaches ( 0,@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical trial involving 5@@ 78 adolescents of 12 to 17 years the most common side @-@ effect head@@ ache , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ subject study , administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( ninete@@ en clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ bin / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the tail @-@ la@@ yo@@ tin on endo@@ th@@ eli@@ al@@ cells .
within a clinical trial involving multi @-@ professional users , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of up to 20 mg every day over 14 days was given , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ac effects was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nec@@ rop@@ age of clinical dose ) was administered for over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls showed itself .
at a single dose survey with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of aviation , including rein@@ forcement of subjective bats or the tasks connected with the fly .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in relie@@ ving the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching on the nose , it@@ ch@@ iness , tr@@ ams and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be classified according to the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and pers@@ isting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ently allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ isting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
as shown in the total cor@@ p of the questionn@@ aires at the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ economics , A@@ eri@@ us effectively minim@@ ises the stress caused by seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria has been investigated for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ology methods irrespective of the e@@ ti@@ ology at different forms are similar and chronic patients may be made easier and spec@@ tively .
as the hist@@ amine is a significant factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular disorders , is expected that des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine carries out in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of p@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dosage .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of the patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka re@@ acted out of the study .
an improvement of the itch to increase over 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with as@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of the sleep and the awareness , as indicated by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmaceutical kin@@ e@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable to the overall seasonal @-@ allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , the patients were a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in 4 % of patients .
there are no clue to a clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after once daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
the enzyme performed for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines will not be excluded completely .

the security of as@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which can be metabo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to those in children who are normally metabolism .
this medicine contains Sac@@ char@@ ose and Sor@@ bit@@ ol , therefore patients with inherited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intolerance , glucose @-@ Gal@@ ac@@ t@@ ose @-@ absorption or a sacred ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suff@@ rage not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have been given as part of clinical studies with as@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered ( see below 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study the anti @-@ consuming effect of alcohol was not ampli@@ fied ( see below 5.1 ) .
the total prevalence of side @-@ effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as with the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side @-@ effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , as in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ professional study of adults and adolescents , administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( ninete@@ en clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 were used for anti@@ hist@@ amine , received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ind@@ om@@ osis of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults can be pre @-@ recorded in adults to the children &apos;s population .
within a clinical trial with multi@@ plying to adults and adolescents , in des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of up to 20 mg every day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ac effects were described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nec@@ rop@@ age of clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls showed itself .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s Vacc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. shall officially assume the approval for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company res@@ umes its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov in preventing the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people for the protection against flu which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine , which is supposed to protect against a trunk of influenza virus that could cause a future pan@@ demic .
a flu @-@ pan@@ demic breaks out when a new tribe of the prevention of influenza is emerging , which can easily spread from man to man , because people have not yet established immunity ( no protection ) .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognises the immune system &apos;s vaccine as being &quot; physical @-@ virus &quot; and is antibodies against it .
thus , the immune system is able to form more antibodies in a contact with a flu @-@ virus of this pedi@@ gree .
then the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane interface , which recognizes the human body as body alien ) , puri@@ fied , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this increases the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pan@@ demic vaccines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
for more information regarding the CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is applied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with human immunity le@@ ased in type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which is causing the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ GM is indeed available as a solution to inc@@ iner@@ ation , but this cannot be taken along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the security of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ GM should only then be prescribed if the doctor has examined , which anti@@ viral medicines has previously taken before , and the likelihood is that the virus is appeal to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which will be taken together with twice daily 100 mg R@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ GM depends upon the body weight .
op@@ yc@@ ase decreases in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS not cure , however , may damage the immune system &apos;s damage and thus also delay the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ GM has been studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults , which previously did not have been treated with the protein wor@@ ms .
this reinforced with low do@@ si@@ avi@@ r increased drug A@@ GM was compared with 20@@ 6 adults , who had formerly been taken in earlier , with other local eas@@ ements .
the main indi@@ indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with un@@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ t@@ last ) , or the change of the virus last after the treatment .
in trials involving patients who had previously taken no protein vulner@@ ability , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml as under placebo , but as@@ par@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ generative is also the viral burden , however , by the children who had been treated earlier with the wor@@ shi@@ per , very few of the treatment mentioned earlier .
in the study involving adults , who were previously treated with protests were treated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicines A@@ GM , the Vir@@ us@@ last after 16 @-@ week treatment are just as effective as other local eas@@ are :
in the patients suffering from HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ eas@@ iness , it came under A@@ generative along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste from the Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks as in the patients who did further advance their previous prot@@ eas@@ ements :
the most common side effects of A@@ generative ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nau@@ seas ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r or any of other constitu@@ ents .
re@@ generative may also not be used in patients , Johann@@ is@@ k@@ wee@@ ds ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are just as well as ather@@ ase are being disp@@ osed and in high concentrations in the blood health are harmful .
as with other medicines for HIV , the risk of a Li@@ bra D@@ ystro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , an oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ass card ( Ab@@ die of bone tissue ) or an immuno@@ deficiency syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection , caused by the rest@@ ling immune system ) .
the Committee on Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ GM in use with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ GM is usually taken along with the phar@@ ma@@ ko@@ kin@@ e@@ tic amplifier , but the committee found that the use of A@@ GM in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously did not have a prot@@ eas@@ iness previously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ GM was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as for scientific reasons only limited information fores@@ een . &quot; &quot; &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the marketing of demo@@ lition in the whole of the European Union .
A@@ GM is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ eas@@ on @-@ treated adults and children from age of 4 .
for usually A@@ generative capsules are intended to be given to the pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tic Boo@@ ster@@ y of Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r should be used in consideration of the individual viral agent and treatment of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r as a solution to inc@@ ision is 14 % lower than of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; hence , A@@ generative capsules and solution for inclusion on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base is not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for am@@ using capsules is 600 mg Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg R@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ generative capsules are used without the rein@@ for@@ ging addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ generative ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generative capsules is 20 mg Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the pharmaceutical kin@@ e@@ tics , effectiveness and safety of as@@ par@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other demonstrators were not examined in children .
A@@ generic ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data on the im@@ memorial and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ generative capsules should be reduced to about 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be carried out with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver disease , in patients with severe liver disease it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
re@@ generative may not be given simultaneously with drugs that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ y@@ enz@@ ym@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
plant preparations to include Johann@@ is@@ k@@ wee@@ ds ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) , may not be used due to risk @-@ reduced plastic de@@ centr@@ ations and a diminished therapeutic effect of Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r during taking Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ generative or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not cause a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ hr@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually , A@@ generative capsules are used along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral hepatitis therapy have increased risk to severe liver effects with potentially fatal consequences .
for the event of the simultaneous treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant technical information of these medicines .
patients with existing restricted liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral hepatitis therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ GM and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other gluten @-@ co@@ stero@@ ids that will be confused about C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended , unless that the possible benefits of a treatment the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ ous the effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hes and pres@@ cri@@ bing of the ad@@ renal function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
as the shifting of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ GM with lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin due to the increased risk of m@@ yo@@ path@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen not recommended .
4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards @-@ Rati@@ o ) , are methods of determining the drug concentration .
for patients who are taking these medicines simultaneously , A@@ generative may be less effective because of decreased plastic ar@@ asp@@ ing effects ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills may be altered , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the kind of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r likewise , patients should therefore be monitored on ov@@ at@@ chment and symptoms , especially if there is also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administered .
because of the potential risk of risk of toxicity due to the high prop@@ ens@@ ity content , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
as@@ par@@ ase should be dis@@ continued in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cos@@ is involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients , who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ eas@@ ters , was reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an Ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases associated with their therapy medicines that are associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B. Higher age , and with drug dependent factors , like a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders , is associated .
in hä@@ m@@ ophil@@ es patients ( Type A and B ) , who have been treated with Prot@@ cies , there are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous phones and her@@ mar@@ thro@@ es .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immune def@@ ective can develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ ist infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ t@@ orial ti@@ ology is adopted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol intake , heavy immun@@ os@@ up@@ pression , higher Body measure Index ) , cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ comp@@ ass in particular were reported in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral hepatitis therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase cannot be given simultaneously with drugs that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ y@@ enz@@ ym@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ generative or rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given along with medicines , whose agents are mainly associated with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with fatal and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is caused by an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical argument and lead to a undes@@ irable development .
in trying to get the lowest Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel by a dosage increase of other protein inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently unwanted effects on the liver were observed .
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ wee@@ ds ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r can be found by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations by Johann@@ is@@ k@@ wee@@ ds ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
when a patient is already taking Johann@@ is@@ k@@ wee@@ ds , the pi@@ cks are avi@@ r@@ mirror and , if possible to check the Vir@@ g@@ last and put it out .
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicine is not necessary , if c@@ lin@@ avi@@ r is given along with Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max on it by 30 % if k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) administered .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which occupy the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % lower when Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with lime ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were reached in the combination of Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with lime ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are about 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily administered .
a lec@@ ting recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r and Kal@@ etra may not be given , but it is recommended a eng@@ masch@@ ige monitoring , since the effectiveness and the obj@@ ection@@ ability of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tic study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but is recommended due to the ci@@ d component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and as@@ hr@@ ase are at least an hour apart ( see an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da down ) .
that is why the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z is in combination with Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment is required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , since the exposure of both proteins would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other protein eas@@ zer and available limited data suggests that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ um might sun@@ k in the ser@@ um @-@ concentration of Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used simultaneously , caution is advised as Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din may be less effective because of the decreased / possibly sub@@ therapeutic plastic ar@@ asp@@ ils .
when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical checks should be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of vi@@ ci@@ vi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in the Plas@@ ma@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin around 19@@ 3 % and with it a rise in the side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
when it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin has to be arranged with A@@ generative or , becomes a reduction in the dosage of a fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data are available .
pharmaceutical kin@@ e@@ tic studies with as@@ par@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out , but the Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg var@@ ic@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max . k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma around 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2,@@ 6@@ 9@@ ple in comparison with the value that was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without the simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ ring@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines , which are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhi@@ bit or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can , if they are used together with map@@ le , possibly lead to interactions .
patients should therefore be treated to toxic reactions which are linked with these medicines , if used in combination with map@@ le .
based on the data of other prot@@ eas@@ iness , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as ather@@ ase , as it may come to resili@@ ence problems .
the simultaneous use of anti @-@ con@@ vul@@ sives that are known as enzyme ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r can lead to a humili@@ ation of the plastic pi@@ geon .
the Ser@@ um concentrations of calcium @-@ can@@ al@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em , side@@ walks , Ni@@ kl@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ ag@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ ag@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r , thus increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the simultaneous intake of abuse can considerably increase their plasma @-@ Con@@ centr@@ ations and reinforce PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in contact side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a clinical study , given in Rit@@ ter@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times a day ) , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate @-@ plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel was significant while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % VAT interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of as@@ hr@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these glucose co@@ stero@@ ids , unless that the possible benefits of treating the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ aken the effects ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
at H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is heavily dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under@@ mining the plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel are expected to be expected in case of con@@ gener@@ ase .

data for the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am with other protein eas@@ es indicate a possible rise in the Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel of Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am around the 3@@ - to 4 @-@ fold .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given along with Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on ov@@ at@@ chment and symptoms , especially if there is also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to be administered .
because of the very low per@@ spir@@ ality of historical comparisons can currently not be given recommendation , as the Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is adjusted if Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with the simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , together with ather@@ ase , a strengthened control of IN@@ R ( International Standards @-@ Rati@@ o ) is recommended for the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mbo@@ genic effects ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills is not predic@@ tible , so as alternative methods of contrac@@ eption .
careful supervision of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in case of simultaneous gift of as@@ par@@ ase ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .

the conclusions with regard to the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always attract the current interpre@@ tations systems for the analysis of the results of resor@@ ting tests .

each of these four with a diminished sensitivity to Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r associ@@ ative genetic patterns creates a certain crus@@ ader resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensi@@ tiveness against In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ sel@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains in general .
there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r and other kind eas@@ ements for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ ring@@ avi@@ r Res@@ ur@@ pf@@ ade , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ spec@@ kled ( one of them reported a resistance to viol@@ in@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ avi@@ r ( one of them reported a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 3 out of 25 ins@@ ulators ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 ins@@ ulators ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 ins@@ ulators ) , Sa@@ qu@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 ins@@ ulators ) and Ti@@ z@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 ins@@ ulators ) and ti@@ d@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 ins@@ ulators )
conver@@ sely , Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ al resistant isol@@ ates ; the conservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early disman@@ tling of a seduc@@ tive therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries that may affect the following treatment detrimental .
the test@@ es of the effectiveness of A@@ GM in combination with Rit@@ ter@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nuclear therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with lower @-@ bed k@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot; received .
one @-@ hundred thre@@ es@@ sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus @-@ sensitivity to A@@ generic ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI , included in the sub @-@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ deficit of AP@@ V / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in relation to the time @-@ ad@@ mill of initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ underground threshold of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the test@@ es of the effectiveness of un@@ bund@@ led ast@@ ray is based on two un@@ controlled trials , with a total of 2@@ 88 HIV @-@ infected children between the ages of 2 and 18 , which were treated 152 with PI .
in studies , A@@ generic ase was used to take up and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg every day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of those treated with PI @-@ treated patients had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included in the study included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Basi@@ cs on this data should be considered in the treatment optim@@ isation with PI @-@ treated children who are considered to be considered to be the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to maximum Ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ stra@@ its approx . 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0,5 @-@ 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max on it by 30 % , if k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) with Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) administered .
administration of Am@@ stra@@ its with a meal leads to a 25 % discount of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of fl@@ yo@@ z@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ imp@@ acted by the food intake , although the simultaneous intake imp@@ acted the scale and the rate of resili@@ ence .
the apparent capacity volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg in a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be adjusted to a large distribution volume as well as an improper penetration of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the substance in the plasma , where the amount of un@@ restricted Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ restricted Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r remains consistent , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during the faculty council in the ste@@ ady Empire in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines must indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ( or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution , if they are given at the same time using demo@@ graphics ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ generative capsules capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg thri@@ ce daily , leads to a similar daily an@@ tic@@ avi@@ r @-@ exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
spec@@ kled avi@@ r is available from the solution 14 % less bio@@ accumulative than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ generative remedy and A@@ generative capsules are not inter@@ changeable to a milli@@ gram base .
also the renal Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , so the impact of kidney disease is likely to be low to the elimination of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r @-@ plastic and comparable to those who are getting to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg , spec@@ kled twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
in long @-@ term studies for can@@ o@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats appeared in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne @-@ pat@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ ome in doses adapted to the 2,@@ 0 @-@ times ( rat ) of exposure to people , after twice daily Gift of 1200 mg Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ oc@@ cellular aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma was not yet un@@ solved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings in clinical studies as well as for the therapeutic use .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ genome tests , the bacterial test tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ cosmic test on rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ation of human peri@@ pher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ an@@ age nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver toxicity may be observed and proven in clinical daily life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase .
so far in clinical trials no significant liver toxicity in patients were observed , neither during administration of am@@ generations nor after the end of the treatment .
studies for toxicity in juven@@ iles , who were treated with 4 days from age 4 , showed high morality in the control as well .
a systemic plastic Ex@@ pos@@ ure , which was significantly higher ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeu@@ tical care among humans , however , were observed a number of minor changes including thy@@ self @-@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes , which point to a hesit@@ ated development .
24 When A@@ generative capsules are used without the rein@@ for@@ ging addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ generative ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generative capsules is 20 mg Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application is intended to be treated with patients with vigil@@ ant or mild liver disorder , in patients with severe liver disease it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards @-@ Rati@@ o ) , are methods of determining the drug concentration .
as@@ par@@ ase should be dis@@ continued in duration 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cos@@ is involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an elevated risk of a li@@ pod@@ stream@@ line was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is caused by an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical argument and lead to a undes@@ irable development .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max on it by 30 % if k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were reached in the combination of Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with lime ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are about 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily administered .
a lec@@ ting recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r and Kal@@ etra may not be given , but it is recommended a eng@@ masch@@ ige monitoring , since the effectiveness and the obj@@ ection@@ ability of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , since the exposure of both proteins would be low .
when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical checks should be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of vi@@ ci@@ vi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
when it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin has to be arranged with A@@ generative or , becomes a reduction in the dosage of a fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose of 31 , although no clinical data are available .
the Ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channels such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ dic@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Ni@@ kl@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ ag@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ ag@@ di@@ pin , and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r , thus increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine .
in a clinical study , given in Rit@@ ter@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times a day ) , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate @-@ plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel was significant while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % VAT interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with the simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , together with ather@@ ase , a strengthened control of IN@@ R ( International Standards @-@ Rati@@ o ) is recommended for the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mbo@@ genic effects ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg o@@ eth@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1,@@ 0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ ic ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r by 22 % or so@@ ap@@ h .
this drug may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful removal of possible usability for the mother in comparison with the possible risks to the fet@@ us .
a Re@@ production study on dre@@ aded rats , of which was given by the in@@ duction in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed during the lac@@ tation period a diminished increase in the body weight in im@@ perfection .
the im@@ memorial of as@@ par@@ ase was examined in adults and in children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in the case of over@@ dose the patient is based on signs of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ fication ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) when required , the necessary support measures should be introduced .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peri@@ pher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ing concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm for infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm with chronic in@@ infected cells ( 1 µm = 0,@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ al resistant isol@@ ates ; the conservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data should be considered in the treatment optim@@ isation with PI @-@ treated children who are considered to be considered to be the use of &quot; un@@ b@@ oo@@ ster@@ ted &quot; A@@ GM .
while the absolute concentration remains of un@@ restricted Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosage inter@@ state in the ste@@ ady Empire in the ste@@ ady Empire in the field of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines must indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ( or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution , if they are given at the same time using demo@@ graphics ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
also the renal Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the impact of kidney disease is likely to be low to the elimination of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ oc@@ ular aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been con@@ solved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings in clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial test of rats and chromos@@ ome @-@ bl@@ ush st@@ est on human peri@@ pher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ an@@ age nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies for toxicity in juven@@ iles , who were treated with 4 days from age 4 , showed high morality in the control as well .
these results can be ruled that in juven@@ iles the metabolic path@@ ways are not fully mature , so Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ generative remedy for inclusion is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ eas@@ on patients and children from 4 years onwards .
the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ster@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the use of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ generic ase Risk Management &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not occupied with PI @-@ treated patients with PI @-@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r as a solution to inc@@ ision is 14 % lower than of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; hence , A@@ generative capsules and solution for inclusion on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base is not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should be when they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with ing@@ esting the solution to taking . ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the recommended dose for ather@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1,@@ 1 ml ) Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2@@ 800 mg Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
additionally , because no dosage recommendations can be given for the simultaneous use of ather@@ ase solution to inc@@ ur and low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dosage adjustment for Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for treatment , an application of ather@@ ase solution to inc@@ iner@@ ation in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ ens@@ ity content , A@@ generative cure is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure , and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may cause a com@@ templ@@ ative inhibit@@ or of these medicines and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects as cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ generative or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not cause a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ hr@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of 47 an transfer of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some pharmaceuticals , which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards @-@ Rati@@ o ) , are methods of determining the drug concentration .
as@@ par@@ ase should be dis@@ continued in duration when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cos@@ is involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an elevated risk of a li@@ pod@@ stream@@ line was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with the drug 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hä@@ m@@ ophil@@ es patients ( Type A and B ) , who have been treated with Prot@@ cies , there are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous phones and her@@ mar@@ thro@@ es .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is caused by an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical argument and lead to a undes@@ irable development .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max on it by 30 % if k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) administered .
the simultaneous intake of hydro@@ chlor@@ ase can increase their plasma @-@ con@@ centric and with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection with effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
on the basis of data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors are expected to be obtained from Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am significantly higher plasma @-@ centr@@ ations by Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am .
the potential risk to humans is not well @-@ known . A@@ generative remedy for inc@@ iner@@ ation may not be applied due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us on the Prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ co@@ l contained in pregnancy . ( see section 4.3 ) .
in the milk l@@ actic rats were detected in Am@@ stra@@ vi@@ r @-@ related substances , it is however not known whether Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r is handed over to people into breast milk .
a Re@@ production study on dre@@ aded rats , of which was given by the in@@ duction in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed during the lac@@ tation period a diminished increase in the 55 body weight in im@@ perfection .
the im@@ memorial of as@@ par@@ ase was examined in adults and in children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
many of these events is not clarified , whether in connection with the intake of A@@ generative or another at the same time are applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of under@@ p@@ aging .
during treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral infections were treated with the currently approved Fos@@ ag@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r Do@@ si@@ ations - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r geb@@ oo@@ static treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ eas@@ ed inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations only rarely observed .
the early canc@@ el@@ ation of a seduc@@ tive 60 therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries that may affect the following treatment detrimental .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Basi@@ cs on this data should be considered in the treatment optim@@ isation with PI @-@ treated children who are considered to be considered to be the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ GM . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent capacity volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg in a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be adjusted to a large c@@ ann@@ in balance , and an unlimited penetration of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ oc@@ cellular aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been con@@ solved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
a systemic plastic Ex@@ pos@@ ure , which was significantly higher ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeu@@ tical care among humans , however , were observed a number of minor changes including thy@@ self @-@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes , which point to a hesit@@ ated development .

the application duration and duration of treatment with Al@@ dara depend on the disease to be treated three times . • In case of small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma it is during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks break between the cycles of treatment cycles , three times weekly .
the cream is bare in front of bed@@ time thin @-@ fancy to the affected skin areas so that they have enough for a long ( approximately 8 hours ) on the skin before they washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dara was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the substance ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four major studies at 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indi@@ indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete lowering of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dara was also treated to 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell cancer in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and either placebo or placebo every day or five times a week .
the main indi@@ indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete withdrawal of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ins .
in all studies , Al@@ dara was more effective than placebo . • At the treatment of heat @-@ treated patients , the complete lowering rate was taken up in all four major studies , but only 3 % to 18 % in patients treated with placebo @-@ treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dara ( watched at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions at the use of the cream ( pain or itch ) .
clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ osa ( AK@@ s ) on the face or on the scal@@ p with immun@@ om@@ able adult when the size or the number of lesi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ yo@@ therapy and contra@@ indicated other topical treatment options is contra@@ indicated or less suitable .

the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to continue as long , until all visible genital war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or interval area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks a treatment period .
a break in the course described above should be weigh@@ ed when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) or if the treatment area has been observed .
if follow the follow @-@ up investigation of 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the lesi@@ ons had only been completely healed should another treatment should be started ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
if a dose was dropped out , the patient ought to carry the cream once he / she notices this and then continue with the usual therapy plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and in the puri@@ fied way to rub with genital war@@ ts , until the cream is re@@ ar@@ ed completely .
it should occur in these patients the risk of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and with the potential worsen@@ ing of their autoimmune disease risk .
it should be a det@@ ective in these patients between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the associated risk associated with possible organ @-@ versus @-@ host@@ al reaction .
in other studies where no daily pre @-@ portable toilets were performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mos@@ is and a case with one of the circumc@@ ision is observed .
when applying I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses there is an elevated risk of heavy local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , under fac@@ tional application have been observed severe local skin irritation , which made a treatment required and / or to have temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions at the outcome of the ureth@@ ra occurred , some women had difficulty passing urine , which claimed an emergency ca@@ the@@ ter@@ ization and a treatment of the affected area .
for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous methods for the treatment of extreme fo@@ genital war@@ ts in the genital and per@@ tin@@ al range there are so far no clinical experiences .
limited data may point to an increased rate of incl@@ ination reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient group in relation to the removal of the genital war@@ ts .
the treatment of the Bas@@ al@@ cell car@@ cin@@ oma carried out with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm by the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips or the hair@@ line has not been investigated .
local work reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during treatment or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary because of the griev@@ ances of the patient or due to the severity of local bon@@ ding actions , a treatment duration can be made of several days .
the clinical result of the therapy can be assessed after the treatment of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the treatment of treatment .
because there are no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable treatment forms should be considered .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs do not provide clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours .
data from an open clinical study point out that there is a lower probability of contact to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy with major tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of tin@@ al ker@@ at@@ ins on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ stick .
there are only very limited data on the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ ins on anatom@@ ical sites outside of the facial and the scal@@ p .
the available data on pat@@ tin@@ al ker@@ at@@ osis on sub @-@ arms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application , thus a such application is not recommended .
local work reactions often occur , but these reactions usually take place in the course of therapy for intensity or go back after lowering the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local community actions are a great discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for several days .
data from an open clinical study suggests that patients with more than 8 acts of lesi@@ ons showed a lesser total healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive treatment ( see 4.@@ 4 ) .
from animal studies , there are no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embryonic / federal development , the delivery or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although neither after one mal@@ ign@@ ant use of quanti@@ fiable application ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) have been reached , no recommendation can be given to use during the breastfeeding period .
the most frequently shared and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with negative side effects in studies with three weekly treatment were local reactions at the place of treatment of genital war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) .

tell your doctor / health care professional or your pharmac@@ ist / your pharmac@@ ist immediately about when you feel comfortable during the application of Al@@ dara cream .
if your skin re@@ acts too strong on the treatment with Al@@ dara cream , you should not use the cream even further to wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap , and your doctor or your pharmac@@ ist .
a lower number of blood cells can make you more prone to infection ; she can make an effect that you get a blue stain from you or she can cause de@@ jection .
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you will have significantly affected or you notice adverse reactions that are not specified in this usage information .
in addition , you can feel it@@ ching on ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas where you have applied Al@@ dara Cream ( 8 % of the patients ) .
most often these are easier fi@@ denti@@ als which will resume within 2 weeks after treatment of treatment .
occasionally , some patients notice alter@@ ations at the application place ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , scar@@ ec@@ o@@ cide , bl@@ isters , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irritation , nausea , dry mouth , gri@@ lled mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzymes for patients with reliable diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ der I ( M@@ PS I ; α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) , in order to treat the not neurological manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves ) .
this means certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ ca@@ ine , g@@ ags ) cannot be degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
following not neurological symptoms of the M@@ PS I may occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements l@@ ur@@ ate , diminished cell volume , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the administration of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with res@@ sing equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicines to prevent any allergic reaction .

the study mainly examined the safety of the drug , but it also measured its effectiveness ( by assessing its effect regarding the reduction of gases concentrations in urine and in terms of the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years old Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine around 60 % , and half of the treated children reported a normal large liver by the end of the study .
the most common side @-@ effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over 5 years ( watched at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , nausea , abdom@@ inal pain , skin rash , ar@@ th@@ ral@@ ie ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion .
very common side @-@ effects amongst patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen adjustments ( a measuring size of pul@@ mon@@ gers ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be hyper@@ sensitive to patients who may possibly respond hyper@@ sensitive to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) .
the European drug Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will update all new information that may possibly be known , and this summary ( if necessary ) is to be updated .
the manufacturer of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients , the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me are obtained , observe with regard to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 the European Commission granted the Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to approval for the marketing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ d@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mammals ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ er@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is contra@@ indicated in patients with reliable diagnosis of a mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ d@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) , in order to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place by a doctor who possesses the experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient adds this , every 15 minutes in single @-@ steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h can be increased .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been identified , and for these patients no d@@ osing scheme can be recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no d@@ osing scheme can be recommended .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients treated in@@ fusion @-@ conditional reactions which are defined as any associated side effect , which occur during in@@ fusion or by the end of the in@@ fusion of the in@@ fusion ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , specifically those patients should continue to be eng@@ ti@@ zed closely and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment , in the re @-@ livel@@ ihood for medical emergen@@ cies right away .
due to the clinical phase 3 clinical trial , almost all patients Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies are to form lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients to develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution in applying Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as little experience regarding the res@@ ump@@ tion of treatment after a longer break is performed , due to the theoretical risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after a break of treatment should be cautious .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) treat to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a slight or intermediate in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or reduction in fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion should be stopped until the symptoms are taken to decrease , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considered .
the in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred to be resum@@ ed .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in fusion rate of 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate occurred in which the pre@@ dominant reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not con@@ currently be used with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular picture of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
animal experimental studies do not let direct or indirect effect on pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , above the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended to satisfy during the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the side effects in clinical studies were predominantly shown to be in@@ fusion @-@ conditioned reactions which were observed at 53 % of patients in Phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under the age of 5 ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
adverse reactions arising in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension of a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a total treatment duration of up to 4 years : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory and lungs in the pre @-@ history , there were severe reaction , including bron@@ chi@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ ation stood and facial oils ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
children un@@ desired drug interactions in the context of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with mainly severe form of reference and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , reported are listed in the table .
100 e / kg intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 g / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within three months of treatment , whereas in the age of 5 patients with a severe drop @-@ in form at the age of 5 ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or to a premature retirement from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were reported by radio@@ immun@@ otherapy ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say det@@ ectable antibodies including 3 patients in which it had never come to serv@@ o @-@ version .
patients with l@@ acked up to low antibodies , a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the res@@ n , while in patients with high antibodies to determine a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ al to low neutral inhibit@@ or effect on the enz@@ ym@@ es@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vit@@ ro , which seemed to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of undes@@ irable pharmaceutical drugs , even though the occurrence of undes@@ irable pharmaceutical drugs typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies .
the basis for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of the imm@@ ac@@ ulate .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed in cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely above Mann@@ osis @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ or@@ us recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were random@@ ised in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ements controlled phase @-@ 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire disease spectrum was the majority of patients from the average phen@@ otype and only a patient pointed to the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited when they had a for@@ ci@@ zed exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change to the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in 6 @-@ minute cases .
all patients were then recru@@ ited by an open @-@ label hiding place where they received another 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients treated with the placebo group an improvement of the lung function and the en@@ vi@@ ability which is shown in the following table .
the open discussion survey showed an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as emerged from the following table .
the delivery of the process in @-@ depth FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant during this period of time , and the absolute lung @-@ volume increased to increase in proportion to the height of the children .
of the 26 patients with Hep@@ reg@@ eg@@ aly before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) has been fixed , which remained constant until the end of the degree program .
with regard to the hetero@@ genic disease rates between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end point ( to be acquired in 6 @-@ minute walking test , movement of shoulder @-@ chairs A@@ HI and visual acu@@ ity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) and a progression of 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tics of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined at 20 patients who had at the time of their intake in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with heavy cargo form and 4 with a mid @-@ run form ) .
four patients the dosage was increased because of elevated GA@@ G@@ - mirror in Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) established after the Z @-@ Score for this age group ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mid @-@ run form reported a normal mental stage speed , whereas in older patients with severe progression @-@ form only limited or no progress in cognitive performance .
in a Phase @-@ 4 study , examinations of pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ Do@@ ge schem@@ ata were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute wal@@ test .
100 e / kg intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 g / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the do@@ zation scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks in patients who have difficulties with weekly In@@ fu@@ sions , an acceptable alternative , however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two do@@ xes are equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that is available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tic profile in patients aged 5 years was similar to those affected by older and less heavily affected patients .
based on conventional studies on security measurements , toxicity , toxicity , toxicity and repe@@ at@@ ic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not allow any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ lim@@ ta is applied together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet spread cancer ( medicines for cancer ) and &apos; mal@@ ign@@ ant &apos; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant ) or cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely slightly slightly to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; cell lung cancer , which does not understand the plate of epith@@ eli@@ um cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not previously been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ en as sole therapy .
to decrease effects , patients should be taken during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and injections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
when A@@ lim@@ ta is given along with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , should before or after the Gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin , in addition a &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a fluid lack ) .

the transformation of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form goes easier into cancer cells than in healthy cells , resulting in higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active time in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ al ten@@ ant , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously had no chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , had previously been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta also compared gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) and both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , survived at an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients , who previously had received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not handle the plate number of epith@@ eli@@ um cells , during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer over @-@ life @-@ times than with the comparative @-@ drug .
in September 2004 , the European Commission informed El@@ i Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. to the marketing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the whole of the European Union .
every single bottle of bottle has to be applied with 4.@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium hydro@@ chlor@@ inated resolution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ or S@@ IS is taken from the circul@@ ating bottle , and dil@@ uted with 0,@@ 9 % sodium hydro@@ chlor@@ ine injection ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mono@@ therapy is shown on treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - cal or metastatic non @-@ cell@@ ed bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment device .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al @-@ car@@ cin@@ oma , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and severity of bon@@ ding actions , on the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed Gift , as well as the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid will be given .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 doses taken in fo@@ lic acid and intake must continue during the duration of therapy and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an in@@ tra @-@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 m@@ c@@ g ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after each third session .
in patients , the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , there should be a complete blood @-@ image created before each Gift - including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a plat@@ el@@ ism .
the Al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ame trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be &lt; 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dosage inspection shall take place under the c@@ ach@@ er@@ ous inspection of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity of the pre@@ destined therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ mat@@ ologic toxicity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient pays the value prior to treatment
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be broken when in patients following 2 dosage reduced toxicity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity or non @-@ hem@@ atology toxicity or non @-@ hem@@ atology toxicity or so@@ - continue the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no clue that in patients aged 65 years old or more , compared to patients aged 65 years of age , an increased risk of secondary risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to inadequate data on im@@ memorial and effectiveness .
clinical trials included patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min with no dosage adjustment , which are recommended for all patients recommended dosage adjustment .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
however , patients with a liver counter@@ ent@@ ang@@ lement of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - Border value and / or Trans@@ amin@@ as@@ en@@ tend from &gt; the 3.@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver inflammation ) are not specifically examined in studies .
patients must be monitored in terms of the push of the push market and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutrality portfolios has again achieved a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thy@@ ro@@ s value , which has achieved a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neutrality , thy@@ ima@@ gery and maxim@@ ally non @-@ ha@@ em@@ atology toxicity , as observed in the previous treatment cycles . ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a reduction of toxicity and a reduction in level 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ atology and ni@@ ak@@ e@@ at@@ ological toxicity such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , feb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was caught - if a pre @-@ treatment with fol@@ ate and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients must be instructed with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a prophy@@ l@@ actic measure to reduce the reduction of toxicity in toxicity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ ons ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and mind@@ set - T@@ ens 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients , intended for therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , must take the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ duration for at least 5 days prior to therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients , in which these events occurred , had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existence hyper@@ tension or Diabetes .
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid buil@@ t. accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space a dra@@ inage of the result before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment will be sur@@ passed .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dium , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally , if this substance was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic active substance .
for this reason the simultaneous occurrence of t@@ resp@@ ite vital substances ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of irreversible damage , the reproductive capacity is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before the treatment - should be advised to obtain advice on sperm @-@ treatment .

in a third study All@@ i was compared with 3@@ 91 obes@@ e patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in the two studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients , the All@@ i 60 mg , showed an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in taking placebo .
in the study involving All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for patients relevant loss of weight loss .
the most common side @-@ effects of All@@ i ( watched at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are stain@@ ed spots at after , Fl@@ atus ( Win@@ ds ) with fa@@ eces , fet@@ al pu@@ ff , fet@@ al secre@@ tions ( fur ) , flat secre@@ tion ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it may not be used in patients who are treated with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing the organ of transp@@ ires ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in for the prevention of blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ ade syndrome ( where not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver illness ) suffer , and in pregnant or nursing mothers .

alli is inde@@ xed to weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body @-@ measure @-@ index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ine , o@@ ist diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alli must not be applied by children and young people under 18 since not enough data on efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however since this list@@ ings are slightly resor@@ ted slightly , is necessary for elderly and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .

the probability of occurrence of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if alli made along with a low @-@ fat single @-@ fat or fat @-@ rich diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by an improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes , before starting a therapy with alli , consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs to be adjusted .
patients , the alli as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or hei@@ gh@@ tened cholesterol levels should ask their physician or pharmac@@ ist ask whether the dosage needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to meet additional wa@@ vering measures to prevent the potential mis@@ conception of the oral contrac@@ eption in the event of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on interactions between medicines and in several cases with the current use of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in @-@ plastic ar@@ f has been observed .
when using war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values could be influenced ( internationally regular rati@@ os , IN@@ R ) ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of the vitamins A , D , E and K and the beta @-@ carot@@ ene remained in the standardization area .
however , the patients should be recommended before bed@@ time a supple@@ mented Mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure a sufficient supply of vitamin ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
after the gift of a nar@@ ro@@ dose Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ one , was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers , who at the same time received a minor decrease of Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the effects of the list@@ ings are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and hang together with the pharmaceutical effect of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side @-@ effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easily and temporarily .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( incidence of available data not ob@@ tainable ) .
the frequency of known side @-@ effects which were noted after the launch of a listing is not known , since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ belief .
uh It is plau@@ sible that treatment with alli gains in terms of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of plac@@ list@@ at and multip@@ lier of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered for a period of 15 days at norm@@ al@@ ge@@ important and overweight individuals without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of the cases reported by the launch of the launch , there are either no side @-@ effects or similar side @-@ effects as reported in the recommended dose of plac@@ ings .
based on studies on humans and animals , it is possible to turn out from a rapid de@@ formation of any systemic effects that are derived from the li@@ mp@@ tive characteristics of plac@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect uses in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by kov@@ al@@ ente to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and pan@@ cre@@ atic lights .
clinical trials has been derived from clinical trials that 60 mg of orbit is taken three times daily , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fet@@ ches .
two double b@@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ements controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 reflect the effectiveness of 60 mg of plac@@ list@@ at which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , o@@ ist diet .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , has been assessed as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as percentage of those who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their weight weight ( table 2 ) .
although in both studies the reduction of weight over 12 months has been observed , the loss of weight loss in the first 6 months occurred .
the average change in the overall cholester@@ in was with a listing of 60 mg -@@ 2,@@ 4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2,@@ 8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average modification of the L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols was with a listing 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( initial value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
for acid @-@ girth , the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with a listing of 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo @-@ 3.6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plastic Con@@ centr@@ ations of non @-@ metabolic organs were not measurable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg of plac@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , therapeutic Do@@ si@@ ations could not be metabo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in the plasma only spor@@ a@@ dically and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of grief .
in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients who administered minimal system@@ ically resor@@ ically resor@@ ted dose , two main metabolic disease , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ si@@ fied Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ format@@ ted lacqu@@ ine group ) , are identified to set the approximate 42 % of the total plastic concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ ge@@ ology , toxicity in repe@@ atable gases , genom@@ ic@@ ity , kan@@ zer@@ o@@ gen@@ ized potential and Re@@ productive Tox@@ ic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not allow any special danger to man .

the most common side effects are associated with the effectiveness of capsules and thereby arise that more fats out of the body are eliminated from the body .
these side effects tend to occur within the first few weeks after treatment starts , since you might not have reduced the fat content in your diet at that time .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nour@@ ishing commen@@ iter@@ ations : • Start you already a couple of days , or better a week , before the first intake of capsules with a fet@@ ating diet . • learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite dish and about the size of the portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likelihood you can exceed your fat limit . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat consuming ev@@ enly onto the daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of an obes@@ e main judgment or a clue to your weight , as you may possibly perform in other programs for weight reduction , learn to control these with time through adaptation of their diet .

Alo@@ xi is used in chemotherapy regim@@ en , which are strong cataly@@ tic nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as for chemotherapy regim@@ ens , which are moderate @-@ chains for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a medicine used as an anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as the effects contained in this age group does not have enough information .
this means that the substance , the bond of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , prevents the recept@@ ors in the gut .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three major studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults , who received chemotherapy regim@@ en , which are powerful or even sol@@ vers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chemotherapy regim@@ ens , the strong cataly@@ st for nausea and vom@@ iting are , 59 % of the patients were treated with alo@@ es , in the 24 hours following chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , compared with 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron &apos;s patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chemotherapy regim@@ en , which are moderate @-@ sol@@ vers for nausea and vom@@ iting are exhibited , 81 % of the patients were treated with alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours following chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
with a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on , these values stood at 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
March 2005 the European Commission granted Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd. for a permit for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the whole of the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting with severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting at moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of alo@@ es to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting which is induced by a severely em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be ampli@@ fied by adding one before the Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids may be ampli@@ fied .
since Pal@@ on@@ otic tron is able to extend the col@@ on fish , patients should be supervised with an@@ am@@ nesty Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after the injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable in the simultaneous gift of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron with drugs that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients , where the Q@@ T interval is extended or those tend to be such an extension .
other than in connection with other chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents , Alo@@ xi is supposed to be used in the days after chemotherapy neither to prevent nausea nor treat nausea and vom@@ iting .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ osis investig@@ ates tum@@ ors of the five investig@@ ational cancer therapeu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical trial , there was no significant pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron and a ste@@ alth stat@@ eh@@ a concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population based on a population @-@ based pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( D@@ ex@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , Ch@@ ini@@ dine , P@@ ini@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron .
experiences relating to the application of P@@ on@@ otic tron in human pregn@@ ancies will not be found , therefore Pal@@ on@@ otic tron should not be used in pregnant or pregnant , unless it is considered by the general practitioner as necessary .
in clinical trial , the most common of a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observe effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly were associated with alo@@ es , headaches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ struction ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity and reactions to the administration ( burning , curing , complaints and pains ) were given in post @-@ marketing experience .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar types of undes@@ irable events demonstrated by undes@@ irable events as in the other doses ; there were no dose @-@ active relations to observe .
there have been no di@@ aly@@ sis studies done , due to the large sharing volume , however , is probably not effective therapy with a alo@@ e over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients , which received a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 c@@ clo@@ phot@@ on , &lt; 1.500 mg / m2 of Cy@@ clo@@ phot@@ on ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 7.@@ 3 hours ) , which was given by day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind experiment , a total of 6@@ 67 patients , which received a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 c@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ osis tron received , were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of the studies with moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy is summar@@ ized in the following tables .
clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were similar to the effects of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron on blood pressure , heart rate and cardi@@ o@@ gram parameters including the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron and Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on .
according to the findings pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ otic tron has the ability to block on the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization of the I@@ on channels and prolon@@ ging the duration of the action destination .
the aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy Pro@@ ban@@ den was the assessment of the E@@ KG effect of i.@@ V. administered by I.@@ C.@@ I.@@ tron in sol@@ itary doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 , and 2,@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous G@@ abe performs an initial decrease of the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations a slow@@ ing elimination of the body with an average season @-@ time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plastic Con@@ centr@@ ation ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentrate @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the whole dosage area of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
according to the Gift of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron was 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses from day 1 and day 5 measured average ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ osis tron @-@ plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tic sim@@ ulations , that with a daily intraven@@ ous Gift of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ osis amoun@@ ted to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with which was measured by 0.@@ 75 mg after the previous intraven@@ ous administration ; however , the C@@ max was higher than 0,@@ 75 mg higher .
approximately 40 % are eliminated via the kidneys , and about another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ sp@@ ans that have compared to Pal@@ on@@ otic tron over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies for met@@ ac@@ ter@@ isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser extent , are involved with I@@ so@@ ys C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron .
elimination After a intraven@@ ous dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ osis tron was found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ otic tron as un@@ changing active substance made some 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous line @-@ injection at healthy , the whole body @-@ tension was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ ale Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver dys@@ functions are the termin@@ ale elimination of elimination and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ otic tron , a reduction in the dose is therefore not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were only observed according to ex@@ positions , which are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , indicating low relevance to clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies revealed the evidence that Pal@@ on@@ otic tron is only blocking at very high concentrations of I@@ on channels , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization and can extend the term potential .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ otic tron ( each dose was given in about the 30@@ times of therapeutic exposure to men ) , which have been given daily over two years resulted in a multip@@ lied incidence of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( thy@@ ro@@ id , pancre@@ as , sp@@ ell@@ ar@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not with mice .

June 2006 , the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative expertise , recommended for the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C to the treatment of hepatitis C with Alp@@ he@@ on 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ecting solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Alp@@ he@@ on a biological drugs called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is similar to the same phar@@ ma @-@ like effective part that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference practitioner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used for treating adult patients with chronic ( long prolonged ) hepatitis C ( one by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic examination the liver tissue damage occurs , in addition , the values of liver enz@@ ym@@ ms alan@@ ine Amin@@ o @-@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increases in the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that inspir@@ es this to the formation of the substance .
the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on submitted data that testify to the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode , safety and effectiveness at hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficiency of Alp@@ he@@ on has been compared with the efficacy of the reference system using 4@@ 55 patients .
in the study , how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after the treatment of treatment is an@@ iced ( that is , no sign of the virus referred to in the blood ) .

furthermore , concerns were expressed in detail that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug are not suff@@ ice .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , who spoke to the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after setting treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on , the disease fl@@ amm@@ ates more patients than with the reference made of reference ; moreover , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects .
apart from that the test was examined in the study , to how far the medicine is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) is not sufficient vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat improvis@@ ations ( one with cr@@ ust formation @-@ like skin infections ) and small in@@ experienced pl@@ in@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ f@@ aded ) , de@@ preci@@ ation and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go does not have to be used for treating infections , which were proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant to st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Alar@@ go does not work against these kinds of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied to patients from the age of nine months , but patients under the age of 18 may not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient relates not to treatment two or three days , the doctor should re @-@ examine the patient and consider alternative treatments .
it works through block@@ age of bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle , in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indication of the effectiveness was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was con@@ ta@@ xed after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients below Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo based on the treatment .
in the treatment of infected animals , Al@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar contact points : when the results of both studies were viewed at home @-@ rounds , about 90 % of the patients of both groups spoke on treatment .
in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( time @-@ filled h@@ ohl@@ rooms in the body tissue ) or from infections that were veri@@ fi@@ ably or presumably by MR@@ SA , is not effective enough .
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which has been observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation to the Con@@ vent .
the Committee on Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go on the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections in relation to the risks ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ ghs : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • infected small in@@ fi@@ ations , de@@ preci@@ ation or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for the marketing of Al@@ tar@@ go in the whole of the European Union .
the patients , in which there are no improvement of improvement within two or three days , are to be considered once more and an alternative therapy can be considered ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in the case of raising awareness or severe local irritation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment has been interrupted , the sal@@ be carefully as@@ certain and an appropriate alternative therapy for the infection can be begun .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary wounds , the effectiveness of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin res@@ hap@@ haz@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were not enough .
an alternative therapy should be considered , if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment , no improvement or a deterioration of an infected person occurs .
the effect of the simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical funds on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
because of low plastic Con@@ centr@@ ations , which were reached in humans for topical skin or infected super@@ fici@@ ally wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition can not be expected in vi@@ vo ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous gift of 2 times a day 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the middle re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be on the me@@ ager skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application patients are not considered necessary , if topical ret@@ ap@@ ul@@ ulin is applied during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reaction @-@ up ic@@ ir@@ ic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate in regards to a statement on the birth and the Federal Republic of gender / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be used during pregnancy only if a topical anti @-@ bacterial therapy is clear and the use of re@@ acts in the gift of a systemic antibiotic is to be preferred .

the novel mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective im@@ itation of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction in a particular bond of the 50@@ s sub @-@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms which differs from the links of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the relationship point ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ connecting center and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ ez@@ Centre .

there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin towards S.@@ p.@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin .
in the event of non@@ response to the treatment at S.@@ aur@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional Vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .

Ambi@@ rix is committed to protecting hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases that concern the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not im@@ mu@@ n against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is normally applied within two doses of existing vaccines , whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
for this reason it may only be used when immun@@ isation there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and it is ensured that the vaccination plan can be led to an end from two doses .
if a refres@@ her dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another H@@ CV or B vaccine may be given .
vaccines work by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) &quot; how it can fight against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognises the viruses and surface anti@@ gens than &quot; alien &quot; and generates antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vaccination for Twin@@ rix adults since 1996 and has been approved in 1997 with Twin@@ rix Children since 1997 .
the three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same diseases , however Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix Children are administered as part of a three doses of existing vaccines .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults are included , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as test@@ ament to the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indi@@ indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , which had developed a protective antibody @-@ con@@ centric one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to six months and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two injections .
Ambi@@ ly took about 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ ly was similar to a se@@ ver and a 12 @-@ month gap between the injections .
the most common side @-@ effects of Ambi@@ rix ( watched at more than 1 of 10 vaccine ) are headaches , appetite deficiency , pain at injection , redness , mat@@ iness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
ambient may not be used in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other constitu@@ ents or Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) are not used .
August 2002 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als s.@@ a. a permit for the un@@ loading of Ambi@@ able in the whole
the Stand@@ ardi@@ an@@ plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the initial dose .
if a refres@@ her age is desired for hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B , vaccines can be vacc@@ inated with the relevant mon@@ ov@@ als vaccines or with a combined effect .
the anti @-@ Hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies are to be found in the same size as after the vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ arian vaccines .
it is not yet fully backed , if immune competent individuals who have addressed to a Hepatitis A@@ - vaccination , a refres@@ her immun@@ isation might require no longer det@@ ectable antibodies possibly through the immun@@ ological memory .
3 As with all injection insulation , for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction , according to the gift of the vaccine appropriate options of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is recommended , the Stand@@ ardis@@ ation scheme is recommended with the combination of the combination of the ultr@@ as@@ per @-@ type virus @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able Hepatitis B type .
for modi@@ fying patients and persons with disrup@@ tions of the immune system , there is no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies , so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be necessary .
as an intra@@ o@@ male inj@@ ecting or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the glut@@ e@@ al muscle could lead to a subtle impact success , these injection mol@@ ds should be avoided .
however , in Th@@ ro@@ genic cy@@ top@@ ia or cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ ly can be inj@@ ected under sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it may occur in these cases after in@@ tra @-@ muscular G@@ abe .
when Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year in the form of a separate injection , t@@ oo@@ ed Poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza type b @-@ vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined meas@@ les tube vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was adequate ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective need to be understood that perhaps no adequate immune response is achieved .
in a clinical trial involving 3 vacc@@ in@@ verteb@@ rates of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , sle@@ ep@@ iness , gast@@ ro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever comparable to the incidence observed in the earlier Thi@@ omer@@ isation and preserv@@ ative .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans combin@@ ation@@ ery .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and tim@@ eliness on a calculation basis per ino@@ cul@@ osis ambient , however , not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the goods observed at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the prob@@ es , compared with 3@@ 9,@@ 1 % in the prob@@ es after the Gift of a dose of 3 @-@ cans combin@@ ation@@ ery .

however , the incidence of mat was comparable to a pro@@ mill ( that is , through the whole vaccine of 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the prob@@ es received that Ambi@@ es were received , compared with 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % at the prob@@ es received the 3 @-@ cans combin@@ ation@@ . ) .
the frequency of pom@@ p@@ ted pain and ar@@ iness was small and comparable that was observed after administration of the composite wood with the 3 @-@ cans vaccine scheme .
in a compar@@ atively study with 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vaccine , the appearance of local interactions and general interactions was comparable to that in administration with the 3 @-@ doses combined with 360 ELISA @-@ units de@@ activating H@@ CV @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B virus .
at the 6@@ - to 11@@ 1@@ s , however , after vaccination with ambi@@ ante a common occurrence of pain ( at the injection ) per dose , does not report per pro@@ band .
the proportion of vaccines that reported on severe side @-@ effects during the 2 @-@ doses ino@@ em@@ en with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ cans vaccine involves the combination of hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B virus that was statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials , carried out in vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ ate rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to month 6 charged dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ ate rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.3 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to month 6 charged dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses received Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combin@@ ant with three doses .
for the 2@@ 89 persons whose Immuno@@ Gen , were out@@ stand@@ alone , were the Ser@@ op@@ r@@ ote@@ traction rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of 3 @-@ Dos@@ en@@ im@@ p it significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , which was reached in a clinical comparative study with 1@@ - up to 11 @-@ year @-@ old a month after completion of the full vacc@@ inations ( i.e. in the month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ inations were received either a 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vaccine scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA @-@ units de@@ activating H@@ CV @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface .
for those who were at the time of the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ation between 12 and 15 years , the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be proven for at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix which takes place in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vaccine scheme .
the immun@@ o @-@ reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that , after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination of combin@@ ant hepatitis A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis B substances in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - up to 15 @-@ year @-@ old , the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies are comparable to that of the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccine scheme in the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccine scheme .

the Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and beverages but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as through bathing in water waste water .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a bl@@ ending face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment .
as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix not fully protect from infection with CV or hepatitis B virus , even if the full vaccine has been completed with 2 cans .
if you are infected with your child prior to the administration of both vacc@@ inations with Hepatitis or Hepatitis B virus ( although she / her child does not feel uncomfortable or ill / feel ) a vaccination may not prevent a disorder .
a protection against other infections that are harmful to the liver or symptoms that are similar to those after a H@@ CV or hepatitis B infection can not be conve@@ yed .
• If you have already been an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself through ju@@ icy skin r@@ ashes , air@@ planes or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have been an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B if you / your child has a serious infection with fever .
• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the prior arrangement of the second vaccination osis ) .
with a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / her child of a vaccination with ambient .
instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined Hepatitis A@@ - / Hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective components per vaccine ( 360 ELISA @-@ units of a formal hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface ) .
the second vaccination osis of this vaccine with decreased content to effective components is usually administered a month after the initial dose and might give you a vaccination protection before ending the vaccination .
sometimes Ambi@@ ly is suffering from people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not into the muscle . • if you / your child is weak@@ ened due to a disease or a treatment in your / his body &apos;s gun , or if you / your child extends to a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
ambient may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to the vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strong the reaction to the vaccination is .
21 Sa@@ ver your doctor if you / your child have additional medicines to take ( including those who have received no prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated with no prescription , or if you have given birth or immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or have planned this in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for the vaccine and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as diverse as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be adequate .
normally , ambient or nursing women is not administered , unless it is imperative that they be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B .
important information on certain other ingredients of Ambi@@ onia Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed dates for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which has been known since issu@@ ance of the first permit for marketing , the CH@@ MP opinion that the benefits risk for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however since Ambi@@ rix not only been placed in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure .
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month using in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ astic extensions ( brain injury as a result of high am@@ mon@@ ium Con@@ centr@@ ations ) in pre @-@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ aps is - split up on several single doses to meals - swal@@ lowed , among the food mixed or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ a tube ( by the abdom@@ inal wall in the stomach of leading bottles ) or a nose @-@ probe ( through the nose into the stomach @-@ leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ aps did not compare to any other treatment or placebo ( hypo@@ cris@@ y medication , that is to be compared without any substance ) .
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to loss loss in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headaches , impotence , fluid pain , fluid pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , uncomfortable body odor or weight gain .
the Committee on Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps was effective in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary tract to high am@@ moni@@ ous levels .
Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; as due to the r@@ arity of the illness , there was only limited information about this medicine at the time of approval .
the use is inde@@ xed in all patients , in which a complete en@@ ym@@ ous lack is already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 lifetime ) .
in patients with a late mani@@ um form ( inc@@ tive En@@ z@@ ym@@ defect , which manifes@@ ts itself after the first life @-@ month ) then there is an indication for use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic En@@ cephal@@ opathy .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with lo@@ ck@@ dys@@ functions AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ule form .
the daily dose is assessed individually in consideration of protein and the growth and development of the patient &apos;s daily protein intake .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early mani@@ um shortage of car@@ b@@ amide , phosph@@ or@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ im@@ car@@ b@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ app@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency need ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0,@@ 4 - 0,@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets should not be given to patients with gor@@ ges , as there is a risk for the emergence of ov@@ sk@@ ating h@@ ul@@ zer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately arrive into the stomach .
every tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , accordingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium and 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at , resulting in maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or serious kidney failure as well as with sodium and eco @-@ formation and are only used with caution .
since Met@@ abol@@ ization and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at are carried out above the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high Dos@@ age ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and a hei@@ gh@@ tened loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a hesit@@ ated matur@@ ing of cr@@ eb@@ r@@ als syn@@ ap@@ ses and a diminished number of working nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be noted whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate was eliminated in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least an undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from an 18 year old anor@@ mal patient , which developed an metabolic encephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ t@@ azi@@ osis , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , pher@@ al neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred during a 5 month old small child with a cute single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , resulting in intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity shown .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active connection that runs through Ac@@ et@@ y@@ ulation with glut@@ amine by phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is left out of the kidneys .
pol@@ ye@@ chi@@ om@@ etric are seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen @-@ atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is thus used as an alternative carrier for the reduction of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram@@ mes sodium in@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ bean between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is crucial that the diagnosis was put at an early stage and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival chances and the clinical result .
the prognosis of the early mani@@ um form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ r@@ st , and the disease itself lead to death with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or their sti@@ cky @-@ free analo@@ gues inside the first year of life .
by h@@ ub@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative paths of nitrogen oxi@@ di@@ zed ( sodium and sodium acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ ated K@@ ost and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to raise the survival rates of new @-@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) to raise diseases on 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rates were treated 100 % , but even in these patients it was time with many to intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits .
in patients with a late mani@@ um form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ots form of the or@@ ni@@ otic trans@@ car@@ b@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary En@@ cephal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurological deficits are hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of neurological condition .
it is well @-@ known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ lic acid is oxi@@ di@@ zed , which is caused in liver and kidney disease , with Glut@@ amin kon@@ ju@@ y , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ wood and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine have been assessed according to gift healthy adult and in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary tract , the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ alized metabolism and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeated gifts of oral cans of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at and its metabol@@ ites has also been studied in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a single dose of 5 g sodium in@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking measurable Plas@@ ma@@ Con@@ centr@@ ations were found by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ ic @-@ cycle disorders or ha@@ e@@ glo@@ omy compared to different doses Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting , no Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma was det@@ ectable .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with sodium acet@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate @-@ centr@@ ations are exceeded the third day five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is eliminated within 24 hours by about 80 - 100 % in the form of the fierce product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests had o@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses treated rats has no en@@ cla@@ ve effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 up to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken either oral ( infants and children , which can still not swal@@ low tablets or have patients with lo@@ ck@@ dys@@ functions ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ y or a no@@ stri@@ pe .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborn children , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um prot@@ eine in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early mani@@ um shortage of car@@ b@@ amide , phosph@@ or@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ im@@ car@@ b@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium in@@ yr@@ at , accordingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium and 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at , resulting in maximum daily dose .
when rats were exposed to the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lic acid of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at ) , it came to lesi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the brain rin@@ de .
a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from an 18 year old anor@@ mal patient , which developed an metabolic encephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ t@@ azi@@ osis , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , pher@@ al neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pancre@@ atitis .
fu@@ yl@@ chi@@ om@@ etric are seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen @-@ atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is thus used as alternative carrier for the elimination of excess ships .
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be presum@@ ed that for every gram it is produced by sodium acet@@ yl@@ but@@ yl glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
already existing neurological deficits are hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment , and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of neurological condition .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ wood in gran@@ ule form , 15 minutes after the intake measurable of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were found .
during the duration of life the patient can keep the ready product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
for this procedure the small measuring spoon was 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spoon 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring stick 8.@@ 6 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at .
if a patient has to obtain the medication above a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved in water before use also in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases are missing certain liver enzymes , so that they accum@@ ulate the suff@@ oc@@ ated waste products which can accum@@ ulate in the body after consuming proteins in the body .
if you have studied laboratory studies , you have to inform the doctor that you may take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium in@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at may affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it &apos;s not prescription pharmaceuticals .
during the lac@@ tation period , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because the medicine might be over to the breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ ache , flavours , im@@ perfec@@ tions , post@@ ulate of the hearing , dis@@ oriented , memory @-@ dys@@ functions and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ log@@ istic states were observed .
when you notice any of these symptoms , do not hesitate to contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of appropriate treatment .

31 • extract a straight edge on the reservoir . • St@@ range a straight edge , e.g. a measuring pressure on the edge of the brass section to remove excess gran@@ ules . • The suggested quantity corresponds to a measuring spoon . • extract the recommended number of measuring spoon from the tank .
angi@@ om@@ ox is applied to the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute Cor@@ on syndrome ( a type of pain in chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dium . ( cardi@@ ac inf@@ estation ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ying &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement of the electro@@ cardi@@ o@@ gram or E@@ KG ) .
if an@@ deto@@ x is used to prevent cl@@ ots in patients which undergo a PCI , a higher dose can be administered and the in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
roughly 14 000 patients took part in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ om@@ ox is compared to all@@ ine @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine to prevent cl@@ ots ) with the conventional com@@ post@@ operative treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during PCI the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the lottery to prevent a zi@@ pper ) , and they received additionally other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as de@@ x@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , angi@@ om@@ ox - with or without gift of GP@@ I - in preventing recent events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year overall as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who undergo a PCI , an@@ gi@@ ox in regards to all indicators was as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for heavy bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ om@@ ox may not be applied in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other hir@@ u@@ dine or any of other ingredients .
it may not be used in patients which have recently had a blood pressure , as well as in people with severe hyper@@ tension or serious kidney problems or an infection @-@ infection .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) found the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and PCI a decent replacement for He@@ par@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a permit for the marketing of angi@@ ec@@ ox in the whole of the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ Hebrew ) attack ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) at an emergency number or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended Initi@@ al dose of An@@ gi@@ ox on patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous herd of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out in a further series of PCI , an additional bolt of 0,5 mg / kg should be increased and the in@@ fusion should be increased to the duration of the surgery on 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bol@@ ster of 0,5 mg / kg shall be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhin@@ op@@ last@@ y .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ om@@ ox in patients with a PCI intraven@@ ous sub@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one in this immediately subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of a all@@ u@@ ity @-@ gift from An@@ gi@@ val has not been studied and is not recommended , even though a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bol@@ ster of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out .
in order to decrease the occurrence lower ACT values , the per@@ tin@@ ent and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully arranged prior to the application and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis can be given intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer necessary , provided that 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion osis is given correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) that are subjected to a PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is 2@@ 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.1 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis occurred .
in patients with moderate kidney injury , which was included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) that was included in the approval , the ACT was worth 5 minutes to the Gift of the Bi@@ val@@ or@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without tin @-@ adaptation at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney injury ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also at di@@ aly@@ sis patient @-@ payment is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ om@@ ox can be initiated by 30 minutes after the treatment of the sub@@ cut@@ ted He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous status of low molecular yeast .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the substance or other constitu@@ ents or against brain species • active bleeding or increased blood pressure risk . • severe un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able hyper@@ tension and / or irreversible kidney injury . • severe kidney injury ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and at di@@ aly@@ sis .
patients are treated carefully in terms of treatment carefully with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ or@@ u@@ dine is given in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if PCI @-@ patients may occur in Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine most bleeding in arter@@ ial pun@@ ctu@@ ation , can undergo from patients who undergo a per@@ aneous cor@@ bic system ( PCI ) during the treatment in principle throughout bleeding .
in patients suffering from the war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , a surveillance of the IN@@ R value ( International Standards @-@ rati@@ o ) should be considered to ensure that the value of the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din has once again reached the level of treatment .
starting from the knowledge about the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ bird , war@@ far@@ med , th@@ rot@@ ation@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ th@@ eli@@ em@@ mer ) it can be understood that these agents increase the bleeding .
in the combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with Th@@ ro@@ radi@@ al aggre@@ gate , or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological h@@ emo@@ st@@ ase@@ es parameters are regularly controlled by regular intervals .
the experimental studies are inadequate in terms of pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see below 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either fragile He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ or@@ u@@ dine group as well as in those with ho@@ in @-@ treated comparative groups , it came in women as well as in patients over 65 years more often at undes@@ irable events than in male or younger patients .
heavy bleeding were defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and TI@@ MI measures for heavy bleeding as well as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding performed under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone significantly less often than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ ographi@@ im@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding has been defined as one of the following events : deposits , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ o@@ cular bleeding or bleeding in the pun@@ ctu@@ ation , reduction of the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / d@@ l with known blood pressure , re@@ operation due to a bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
more , less frequently observed hem@@ or@@ loc@@ ations that occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gast@@ ro@@ board , ear , nose or neck .
the following information about side @-@ effects are based on the data of a clinical study involving Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine at 6000 patients who undergo a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ or@@ u@@ dine group as well as in those with ho@@ in @-@ treated comparative groups , it came in women as well as in patients over 65 years more often at undes@@ irable events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred among Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine significantly less often than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
the following side effects which are listed above were reported on extensive use in practice and are summar@@ ized in chart 6 after extensive use .
in the case of over@@ dose the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is immediately canc@@ eled and the patient eng@@ masch@@ ige in terms of signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ val contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , a direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ m@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and also on the Ani@@ olo@@ en@@ kar@@ ation region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether it is tied in a liquid phase or to Ger@@ inn@@ ie .
the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine in Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on the one hand is slow@@ ing the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Ar@@ g@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , whereby the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generated .
in addition , it was caused by Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with Ser@@ um from patients , in which there was in the past to indu@@ par@@ able thy@@ ro@@ ism syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , indu@@ ce no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ro@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in healthy volunteers and in patients Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine shows a dose @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ator@@ ic effect that is occupied by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was conducted with the patients following a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine should be increased and the in@@ fusion should be increased to the duration of the surgery on 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY C@@ CI was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute Cor@@ on syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ rob@@ bery ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .

Ap@@ id@@ ra is used for the treatment of adults , juven@@ iles and children from six years of age with diabetes .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm inj@@ ected or administered as a permanent fusion with a insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin in the control of the glucose level ( sugar ) produced in the blood or may process insulin in its entirety .
insulin pump is very different to human insulin , and the change means that it has a faster effect and it has a shorter activity of time than a short @-@ effective human@@ ism .
Ap@@ id@@ ra was used in combination with an effective insulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between 4 and 17 years .
in type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body of insulin is not effectively processed , Ap@@ id@@ ra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indi@@ indicator of the effectiveness was the change of concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study involving adult with type @-@ 1 diabetes was established after six months a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( of 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin pump .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with ap@@ id@@ ra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % on human normal levels .
Ap@@ id@@ ra should not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin or one of the other components , or in patients suffering already at a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
doses of Ap@@ id@@ ra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose level .
September 2004 the European Commission granted San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH for the marketing of Ap@@ id@@ ra in the entire European Union .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections either in the area of the abdom@@ inal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the del@@ ha@@ th@@ mus or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdom@@ inal de@@ cks .
due to the diminished Glu@@ cos@@ e@@ o@@ genesis capacity and the decrease of insulin , the insulin can be dem@@ oted in patients with a restriction of the liver function .
any change in the force , the mark ( supply ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , or cancer , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method may draw a change of insulin requirements .
3 A inadequate dosage or demo@@ lition of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ aid diabetes may lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
adjustment of a patient to another insulin or a insulin should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may take a change in the dosage .
the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia is dependent on the activity profile of the used insulin and can therefore change in the conversion of the treatment schem@@ as .
among the substances that may increase the blood sugar intake and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias , include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , anal@@ ges@@ ic , Flu@@ ox@@ etine , flu@@ ox@@ etine , ox@@ o@@ cide , S@@ ali@@ cy@@ l@@ ates , S@@ ali@@ cy@@ l@@ ates and sul@@ ph@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effects of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as Bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , Guan@@ ac@@ id@@ ine and Reser@@ va the symptoms of ad@@ renal glands are allevi@@ ated or absent .
animal experimental studies for re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ism showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ eness in terms of pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the birth or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin is im@@ penetr@@ ated into human mother &apos;s milk , but insulin is generally not absorbed into the breast milk , nor is it absorbed into oral use .
below are the results of clinical trials known as undes@@ irable drug stim@@ ul@@ ties , group@@ ed according to system organ@@ ically and ordered according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 ; &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( incidence on the basis of orda@@ in data not ob@@ tainable ) .

Li@@ pod@@ stream@@ ystro@@ phy failed to switch the injection point within the injection range , may result in a result of a Li@@ pod@@ stream@@ ystro@@ phy at the injection station .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias with consci@@ ous@@ y can be treated by a in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) that is given by a physician according to intraven@@ ous gift , or treated by a doctor by intraven@@ ous moti@@ f .
according to a glucose level , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to identify the Ur@@ - item for the heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces the blood sugar levels through the stimulation of the peri@@ pher@@ al glucose absorption ( especially by skel@@ etal muscle and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing the glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that during sub@@ cut@@ aneous fork in the efficiency occurs faster and the time duration is shorter than with hu@@ st@@ man@@ em normal .
in a study with 18 male people aged 21 up to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes , insulin pump showed insulin in therapeu@@ tical effect in therapeu@@ tical effect on the dose of 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and 0,@@ 3 E / kg or more of a dis@@ proportionate increase in the draft car@@ ving effect , exactly like human .
insulin pump is twice as fast functioning as the normal human system and achie@@ ves the complete draft loss of about 2 hours earlier than human cancer .
from the data , it was obvious that in an application of insulin pump in 2 minutes before Me@@ al , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved like with human@@ eness , which is 30 minutes before the meal .
insulin pump was reached in 2 minutes before the meal , a better so@@ bri@@ di@@ al control was achieved than with human average ti@@ pping , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
insulin is reached in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparative gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved like with human normal weight , which is given 2 mi@@ ths before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin delivery occurs in G@@ abe 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the beginning of the meal in comparison to human normal weight , which was 30 minutes ( normal - 30 minutes ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1@@ A ) as well as compared to human normal weight , which was given 2 minutes ( normal - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin delivery in G@@ abe 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human normal painting , which was 2 minutes ( normal - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
