<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public License Report (EPAR), which is explained as the studies carried out by the Human Rights Committee (CHMP) in order to access recommendations on the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the package age (also part of the EPAR) or consult your doctor or a pharmacist.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of melt tablets (tablets which can dissolve itself in the mouth), as a solution to taking (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wiring thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing of things that are not available), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar disorder, a mental disorder, in which the patient manic episodes (periods of abnormal floods) have alternating with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes and the prevention of chronic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is applied to rapid control of increased anxiety or behavioral disorders, when the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be applied to the ingestion or melting patient in patients who are getting the swallowing of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">For patients, who are simultaneously taking other medicines, which are just as desired as bilify fy, the dose should be adjusted by bilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is probably used primarily as a "partial" player "for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means Aripiprazole such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser extent regarded as the neurotransmitters to enable the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole carries to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and their re-occur is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of bilify, to prevent the recurrence of symptoms, has been studied in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two trials of 805 patients suffering from schizophrenia, or similar diseases, compared to a placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In a further study, Abilify has been assessed for over twelve weeks to 347 patients with semi-operated patients, in a different study the effectiveness of bilify and placebo that have been stabilized to 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms have already been stabilized with bilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of bilify injections was made in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that were on patched inferment, using the Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change of symptoms experienced by patients with a standard-scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients suffering from treatment discussed.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absorbed the melt-coated and the solution to taking into.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection solution showed patients who received ambilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms indictive anxiety than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for treating bipolar disorder, Abilify was more effective than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bilify also fetched up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo the re-emergence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was given in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms of undisturbed anxiety and were similar effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side-effects of bilify fy (watched at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrappridal disorders (uncontrollability), vomiting (punctuation), obscure secretion (instipation), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleeping disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Human Genetics (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of bilify and from moderate to heavy loads in Bipolar-I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes discussed the treatment with Aripiprazole, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, the Committee on the outcome came to the outcome that the benefits of injection is increased from increased anxiety and behavioral disorders in patients suffering from schizophrenia, or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar disorder when a orale therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004 the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the marketing of bilify in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to heavy-sized episodes of the bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes in the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIZY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day at once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness at doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILWY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combintherapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients, a lower Initial dose should be considered, if clinical conditions justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 induction included in the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of insufficiency behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disturbances, and has been reported in some cases following the beginning or after a change of anti-psychotic therapy, also in case of treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study revealed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no increased risk of sufficiency with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardiac arrests), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which are used for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood-printed medicines) or hypertension (including akzelerized and maligny form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, the one year or less digested, there were occasional reports on during the treatment with Aripiprazole Dyskinesia.</seg>
<seg id="39">If at one with ABILIFY patients treated signs and symptoms of late dyskinesis, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms appearing on a mns, or unclear high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotic medicines must be reset, including ABILIZY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole should be used in patients with crampfantry in anamnese or states that are related to accidents.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients, who were treated with Aripiprazole, was elevated mortality compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the attack for unwanted cerebrovascular events with arithmezole patients treated.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with Ketoaziosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related undesirable events associated with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic agents that provide direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania, the application of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side-effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central medicinal drugs by itself over sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-Antagonis Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resilience of Aripiprazole, although this effect is not considered a clinically relevant result.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine), AUC of Aripiprazole for 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to have other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">With CYP2D6 'bad') metabolic disease the joint application may result in high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plastic Concentrates, compared to CYP2D6 extenze metabolic suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the joint gift of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteases, should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar doses.</seg>
<seg id="55">After lowering the CYP2D6- or 3A4-Inhibitors, the dosage given by ABILIFY should be lifted to the tin levels before the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 is given along with ABILIFY can be reckoned with a moderate increase in Aripipzol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies cans of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metacism of substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethinan-ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (ovecclole) and 3A4 (dextrouser).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or getting pregnant during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data situation for humans and due to the concerns raised in reproduction, this medicine may not be used in pregnancy, unless the possible benefits justifies clearly the potential risk to the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics patients should be warned of the patients previously, dangerous machines, including vehicles, to operate, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side-effects below is defined according to the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study conducted over 52 weeks, patients were treated with Aripiprazole, a total lower incidence (25,8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, acathy, dystonia and Dyskinesis, compared to those treated with semi-operated (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study on 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19% in patients among Arizpizole treatment and 13,1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In a different controlled long-term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole, and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Ottoman episodes in Bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.5% was charged with patients among Arigatprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with semi-operating treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In a different study more than 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.6% was reported in patients with arithmezole treatment and 17.6% for those with lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term phase over 26 weeks of placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS confirmed 2% for patients among Arigatruzol- treatment, and 15.7% for patients treated to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups, under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, revealed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases the CPK (creatine phosphate ase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Arizpizole patients compared to 2,0% of patients treated to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Among the side effects which can occur in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy, and above their occurrence in treatment with Aripiprazole, include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome and varicomrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentionally or intentional acute overdose with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the effectiveness of an heredification in treating an overdose with Aripiprabenzene, but it is unlikely that hemoralysis is used in treating an overdose of use, since Aripiprazole shows a high plastic maple.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is believed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder on the combination of a participatory effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin mHT1a- receptors and a antagonistic effect on Serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity for dopamine D2 and 5HT2a receptor and a weighed affinity for dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenal ergen and for histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">At Gabe of Aripiprazole in Dosiages of 0,5-30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy Probanden revealed the Possible lumissions-tomato, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the Nucleus caudatus and the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenen patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Aripiprazole compared to placebo a statistically greater improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a holding-controlled study, a week 52 the share of the Responder patients, who included a response to the study medication, in both groups similar to Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperdol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measuring parameters that were defined as secondary courses, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depressants scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than on holding hands.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study on 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, for Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher reduction in return rate, which was 34% in the arithmezole group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a grano-controlled, multinational double-blind study on schizophrenia, over 26 weeks, the 314 patients were involved and involved in the primary study of aging (N = 18, or 13% of compensation patients) compared with significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg in an average weight of approx.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks of patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a placebo against placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with an manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior effectiveness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two Placebox and active-controlled monotherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole showed a placebo over placebo over placebo over a week of placebo based on placebo or semi-operated dol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aripiprazole also pointed to 12 a comparable percentage of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania on such as lithium or neck.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients suffering from a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partially overlooks after 2 weeks on Lithium- or Valproat-monotherapy in therapeutic supplements, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole appears in comparison to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had reached an emission period during a stabilisation phase before Randomisation before Randomisation, particularly in regard to the prevention of a bipolar relapse, predominantly in the prevention of a relapse in the Mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on vitro-studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the stretching and hydroxyz of Aripiprazole, which is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole with extensive metallization over CYP2D6 and about 146 hours with 'bad' (= "poor") of metabolic disease via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in the pharmaceutical kinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, and they showed no gender-based effects on a pharynkinetic examination.</seg>
<seg id="91">A study-specific analysis on pharmacokinetics yielded no indication of clinically significant differences with regard to ethnic affiliation or the impact of the smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic characteristics of Aripiprazole and dehydro-arias were similar to patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study with probatively liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of the liver function of arithmezole and dehydro-pipiprazole, but the study comprised only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on security measurements, toxicity, toxicity, toxicity and edge-performance potential, the preclinical data showed no special dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxikologically significant effects were only observed in doses or expositions that exceed maximum dosage or exposure to humans, that they have limited only limited or no meaning for the clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects encompassed a dose-dependent secondary cissors (Lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or Parenchyrinden-karams / carcinoma at female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10ple) at the recommended steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of humans.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis has been determined as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjuzates of hydroxyzmitzates of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (AUC) at recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose of human being based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the effects contained in the human Gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of hydroxy- Arizpizole is no longer considered 6% of the concentrations that were determined in the study about 39 weeks in the Gall of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro-solubility.</seg>

<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg customs ic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg, micronutrid once daily during 2 months was detected in two six-month comparison studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">The combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease of the pain and pain relief compared to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients, which at the end of the six month's main study were classified as reset (upon the therapy), were able to be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 with aclosta and the 107 with risedronat treated patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response was in 141 of the patients treated with Acadsta, compared to 71 of the patients treated with risk-treated patients, are maintained during a mid-period of follow-up phase of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Unique and multi-time 5 and 15 minutes of constant Infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg customs ic acid in 64 patients took the following pharmacokinetic data that proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Thereafter the Plasmaspiegel rapidly took off at &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long lasting phase of very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the peak value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphashic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life-times ½ α-1,87 hours, followed by a lengthy elimination phase with terminating elimination of elimination of ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages of development (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) represent probably the rapid cancellation in the bones and the excretion about the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 h you can find 39 ± 16% of a given dose in urine, while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The overall body Clearance is independent of the dose of 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains uninfluenced by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of customs clearance concentration by 30% at the end of infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentric against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearing of by cytochrom-P450-Enzymsystems metabolized substances is unlikely, because Zoledronutrid will not be metabolized when humans are not metabolic and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, fuel-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see Section 4.2) The renal Clearance of Zoledronacid correlate with the creatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin Clearance, and amounted to 64 patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">It follows that a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a numerical kidney disease is down to a creatinin Clearance until 35 ml / min does not require dosage adjustment of customs clearance.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since serious kidney disease (creatinine Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only have limited data, are no statements made for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-effective intravenous single dose amounted to mice 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies in dogs were soldered of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the 6times the recommended human therapeutic exposure), administered for a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renale influencing.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application, the renal perfusion in 3-day intervals, referred to by 66 mg / kg (a cumulative dose, which corresponds to the 7ples of human therapeutic exposure, referred to the 7ples of human therapeutic exposure, referred to the 7C, corresponds to AUC, corresponds), well tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos are used for the treatment of type-2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where Metmold (a Diabetesmediachemotherapy) is not used.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can additionally be applied to metformin patients (especially overweight patients) using metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphonic fuel or insulin, the previous dose of the sulphonic treatment or insulin can be maintained, except for patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced the dose of sulphonic fuel or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's physical should be better recycled and the blood sugar is reduced to which type-2 diabetes can be better set.</seg>
<seg id="754">More than 1 400 patients were examined the effectiveness of Actos in Tripletherapy; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonic fuel, in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Actos or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylized hemoglobin, HbA1c) measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a reduction in the HbA1c value, which suggests that the blood sugar values were lowered by 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Triplea study, the effect of an additional gift of account for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulphonic nutrient in a reduction of HbA1c values were 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo resulted in lowering of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin is examined in 289 patients, patients requiring action in addition to insulin, a reduction of HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who took additional placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos are visual dysfunctions, infections of the upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and hypothesiologist (diminished sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients, which may be hypersensitive to Pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, cardiac insufficiency or diabetic ketoaziosis (high ketone mirror - acidspar) - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos are in part of a monotherapy (in the only use) as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin patients, where Metformin is not shown.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and inappropriate to those metals, due to contraindications or intolerability (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">The application of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age are no data available, so the use in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering through the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should begin the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose of dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain or oils, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain and oils, when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study with Pioglitazone with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrovascular disease has been performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of heart failure, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output levels (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror is lifted up to the 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, liver enzymes are as soon as possible to control.</seg>
<seg id="773">In case a patient symptoms develops, that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, superficiency, fatigue, loss of appetite, and / or darker hardn, the liver enzymes are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient will be continued with Pioglitazone should be led to the precursors of the Laboratory parameters of the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weighting has been shown, which can be stirred from fats and in some cases it is connected to a fluid-retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of an heredid performed under the therapy with Pioglitazone a minor reduction of the middle hemoglobalized world (relative reduction by 4%) and the hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes have been observed in comparative-controlled trials by Pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4%) and to a lesser extent also in patients taking sulphonic solids and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and the hematology 7.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin, in patients, the pioglitazone is considered oral two or three-compoal therapy with a sulphonic compound or as a two-type combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the launch of the market it was reported in the treatment with Thiazolites Indies, including Pioglitazone, above the appearance or a deterioration of a diabetic brooction with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the appearance of macular oils if patients report on failures of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmologic evaluation should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages of undesirable events concerning bone breakthroughs from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The frained questionnaires was 1.9 questionnaires per 100 patient years with the women treated with Pioglitazone treated women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years of research of cardiovascular medicine, fractures stood at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 0.5 mi / 0.5%; 0.5 mi / 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes to pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is processed (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for examining the interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not have relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digesoxin, warfarin, phenooumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium kanalblocker and HMGCoA reductters do not expect.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with Miroszil (a cytokrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC by Pioglitazone by the 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytokrom P450 2C8 induction) resulted in a reduction of AUC by Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazone diminished the hypinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance to the mother's mother and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the federal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; common &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (from this data not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a transiting change of Turgors and the fraction of the lens, as they will also be observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone the ALT ascents occurred across the threefold limit at the normal range, but less often than placebo, but less often than in comparison between metformin or sulphonic solids.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with pre-existing macrovascular disease the incidence of a severe heart failure was reported under Pioglitazone by 1.6% higher than placebo if Pioglitazone or bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the launch of the market it was rarely reported via heart failure, under Pioglitazone, however, when Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac insufficiency in the anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was conducted a summary analysis of messages of undesirable events concerning bone broods from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in patients treated with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing proactive study, fractures stood at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of the patients treated with Pioglitazone treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days have no symptoms encountered.</seg>
<seg id="798">Picoglitazone seems to have an activation of specific core receptors (peroxic proeptor-g (PPAR-g)), which leads at the animal model to an increased insulin-sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclacide as monotherapy has been continued over two years to examine the time up to the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the treatment the therapy has been checked (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) by Pioglitazone at 69% of the patients treated (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placements controlled study about 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three-month optimization phase with insulin, were randomized to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the middle HbA1c - value by 0.45%, compared to the patients that still only received insulin; a reduction in insulin of insulin in the group treated with pioglitazone group was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, under Pioglitazone, a statistically significant decrease of the album / creatinin quotient compared with the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monogram with 45 mg / placebo (placebo) has been evaluated in a small, 18 weeks investigation by type-2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, a reduction of the overall serum triglypteride and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HDL- cholesterol levels as well as neglily, however clinically notated significantly increased LDL- cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years reduced Pioglitazone compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclacide the total plastic cries and free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison with placebo, under Pioglitazone, there was no statistically significant increase in the LDL cholesterol levels, while under metformin and gliclacide have been diminished.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone does not only visit the sober triglyceride levels, this has an effect on the triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic triglycerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular Outcome study, 5238 patients were randomized with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrovascular disease in groups, which received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral use Pioglitazone gets absorbed quickly, with the top-concentration at unchanging pioglitazone in the plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution from M-IV corresponds to the effectiveness in such a triple the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interactions studies could be proven that Pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenooumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with Gemfibrozil (a cytokrom P450 2C8 induction) or using Rifampicin (a cytokrom P450 2C8 induction) and lowers the plasmasconcentration of Pioglitazone (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactive markers Pioglitazone, the marker was found mainly in the folded (55%) and to a lesser extent in the resn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination period of unchanging pioglitazone is at the age of 5-6 hours, and that of the total active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma-Concentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced renal function lower than in healthy subjects, but contrasts with the instalments of the oralen Clearance of the mother's stance.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeal administration of plasma, anaemia and reversible oxic heart hypertrophia.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazone diminished the type of insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance, thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the federal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), during the rat increased incidences of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the uric epithelium induced.</seg>

<seg id="866">Actraphane led to the removal of the HbA1c-mirror, which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were similarly severe as with another humaneness.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to humaneness (rDNA) or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">Moreover, the cans of Actraphane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that may affect the blood sugar (the full list is the package price).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee on Human Genetics (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Actraphane oboutweigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">October 2002, the European Commission granted Novo Nordisk A / S for the marketing of Actraphane in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily, if a quick initial effect is desired with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection-needle must be held at least 6 seconds long under the skin to make sure the total dose has been injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar set out clearly improved by an increased insulin treatment, can be altered by hypoglycaemia-Warnosis symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of strength, mark (manufacturers), insulin (etc.), type of insulin (etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin or insulin) can cause a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dosage adjustment is needed when changing to Actraphane, it can be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients participating in hypoglycaemic reactions following a change of animal in human insulin, reported that early Warnsymptoms of a hypoglycaemia had been less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling, the patient should go over several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor, as such travel may lead to that insulin and meals must be used or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The physician must therefore take into account possible interactions with the treatment and always ask for patients such as medicines.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 throws hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycaemia, which can occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetestherapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit pulpd in utero.</seg>

<seg id="886">However, a hypoglycaemia can be developed in stages: • Unlight hypoglycaemias can be treated by the orale gas supply of glucose or sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have trauma sugar, candy, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • heaviness of hypoglycaemias are treated with a intra-muscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven aid person or is given by glucose, intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the activity is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active duration is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Rorption The Resorgement profile is established in it, that it is a mix of insulin products with a faster and / hesitant respite.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of spas (hydrolysine) places on the human insulin molecule has been considered; none of those caused by the splitting of the metabolites is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional studies on security measurements, toxicity, toxicity, toxicity, carcinogenic potential and Reproductive Toxicity, the preclinical data do not allow any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1172">In the second study, two doses of adenuric (once daily 80 and 120 mg) were compared a year to 762 patients compared with Allopurinol.</seg>
<seg id="1173">In both studies, Allopurinol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day.</seg>
<seg id="1174">The main indiindicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients whose urethral changels had fallen into the blood during the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1175">In the first study, 48% (126 of 262) patients, the adenuric participated in a dose of once daily 80 mg, and 65% (175 of 269) of patients who participated in the last three measurements in the blood of under 6 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1176">Compared to that, this was 22% (60 of 268) patients under Allopurinol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of adenuric (watched at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea, nausea (nausea), skin rash and abnormal liver values.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since first of the first-line data, the CHMP opinion has been evaluated positively, but considering that the safety profile should be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP is on the basis of the security profile of ADVATE, which requires a filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the admission-owner should apply for another period in five years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited officially distributed to the Committee on Human Genetics (CHMP) officially that the company resigns its application for approval for the marketing of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (tissues that connect other structures in the body, surrounds and leans).</seg>
<seg id="1642">It is a type of virus that has been modified genetically modified to carry a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is a" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which has been changed so that there cannot be copies of himself, and therefore cannot cause any infections in human beings." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have injected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancerous cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 Protein, which is formed from the unbroken in the human body existing p53-gene, normally bears the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni-cancer, where the p53-gene defective is, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company submitted data from a study involving a patient, at the Li-Fraumeni Cancer in the area of the undermining, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had informed the answers of the company's questions, there were still some questions unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the assessment of the initial documentation, the CHMP gives a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">In the CHMP opinion, it was not proven that an injection of Advexin Li-Fraumeni-Tumore takes advantage of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug, in the body, the way of administration as well as the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not proven sufficient that Advoccan be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The Company did not inform the CHMP, whether the withdrawal may have consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "compound" programs with Adventiin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"changing foods" means that the tablets are so combined that one of the effective components immediately and the other is being released over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerosaze is used for treating the symptoms of seasonal rhinitis (hay fever, due to an allergy to pollen protrued inflammation of the nose-way) in patients with nasal nose (clothed nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents 12 years of age, the recommended dose of aerosaze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and end as soon as the symptoms, above all the swelling of the nose-sskin (clothed nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the drug can be disconnected to the stipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main working conditions were the changes in severity of hayfever fever, which were reported by the patients prior to treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study the patients carried out their symptoms all 12 hours in a journal and evaluated with a standard scale as difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When considering all hay symptoms, except the constipation of the nose, the patient reported the aerosaze received over a decrease of the symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% compared to the patients that took Pseudoephedrin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose-sander was seen, the patients showed a relieving of the symptoms by 37.4% against 26,7% in patients who took desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerosaze (watched at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia, cardiyngitis, psychomotor, psychomotor, obstruction, headaches, tiredness, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnia and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerosaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoephedrin or any of the other components, versus adrenergic ingredients or Loratadin (another medicine for treating allergies) are not used.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerosaze is also not used in patients who suffer from a bottangle glaucoma (higher eye pressure), cardiac or vascular diseases, hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension caused by the thyroid) or have had a risk for an adolescent stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission (SP Europe granted approval for the marketing of aerosaze) within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is to swallow it in the whole (i.e. without disintegrating or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerosaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the failure of data to unobjectionable and effectiveness (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after lowering the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the time of use on 10 days, as for long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrin can decrease with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucosas in the upper breaths, treatment can be continued with desloratadine as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As Aerinaze pseudoephedrin contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients suffering with an monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor within 2 weeks after the completion of such a therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combination with other vasoconstrictors, pergoid, liskan, Ergoydroergotamine or other decongesic acid, phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, Ephedrine, Oxymetacoline, nhazoline, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy has not been reviewed for this patient collective, and the data are not sufficient for speaking relevant recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and effectiveness of aerosaze has not been tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data are not sufficient for speaking relevant recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed about the treatment performed in a hypertension or tachycardia or pachycardia, heart rhythms, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of headaches).</seg>
<seg id="1677">In treating the following patient groups, patients are advised of caution: • Patialis patients with cardiac arrhythmia (patients with cardiac arrhythmia) patients with a myocardium in the anamnese, diabetes mellitus, bladder or bronchivalm in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerosaze is to prevent at least 48 hours before performing dermatologically tests, as antihistaminika can otherwise inhibit positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">However, within the framework of clinical trials with desloratadine in which erythromycin or Ketoconazole were additionally administered, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the PlasmaConcentration of desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor testing could not be significant differences between the patients with desloratadine and those treated with placebo patients irrespective of whether desloratadine was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme performed for the Metabolism of desloratadin autonomous enzyme has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin hemmed in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in-vitro-studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The invalidity of the use of aerosaze during pregnancy is not guaranteed to take experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals have not always been transmitted to humans, and because of the vasoconstric characteristics of pseudoephedrine, aerosaze should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be elucidated about that in very rare cases it may come to a benomeness that may lead to upper limb impairment or ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms can vary between a cNS depression (sedation, Apnoe, diminished mental attention, Zyanose, coma, cardiovascular collision) and a cNS-stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations) with possible letins.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, frightening Miktion, muscle weakness, and increased muscle tone, euphoria, arousal, respiration, thirst, vomiting, predimental pain, dizziness, tinnitus, aggravie, visual dysfunctions and hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A cNS-stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouth-dry, peupillenrigire and - dilatation, hood, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibitions of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastair cells / Basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the child disease P-seltin on endothelcells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">With an individual dose survey with adults, desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of aviation, including reinforcement of subjective bats or the tasks connected with the fly.</seg>
<seg id="1691">Controlled clinical trials were found in the recommended dosage of 5 mg every day for increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further likeable effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestation of a TINS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It took 1,248 patients at the age between 12 and 78 years with seasonal rhinitis, with 414 patients received their aerosaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine intermediate efficacy of aerosaze tablets, determined by the total cores for symptoms symptoms, significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoepheet over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerosaze tablets with regard to the sweeping effect, determined by the nose-loop, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the context of a single dose study to pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze is desloratadwithin within 30 minutes of administration in the plasma detectable.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerosaze at healthy volunteers over 14 days became the fly-weight of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudo-heath in the day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose survey conducted with the formulation as tablet for healthy adult testing, has been observed that four probes of desloratadin badly damaged.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component's Interactions study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine according to the allotephedrine bioequivalent has been exposure to the gift of an aerosaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on security measurements, for toxicity in repeal gases, for genome toxicity and the Reproductive Toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadine does not show any particular dangers to man.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination also had no greater toxicity than their individual components, and observed effects were generally linked to the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductionated toxicological studies the combination of Loratadin / pseudo images in rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and the rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day is not teratogenic.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in module 1.8.1 of the application's application order has been established and works, before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to relieving the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, an original substance, its effect can develop.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rhinitis (including four studies at seasonal rhinitis and two studies of patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms (itching, number, and size of the paddling, impairment of sleep and performance at the day) before and after six-week treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were presented to prove that the body is the syrup to take the solution to the insertion and melting clothes in the same way as the tablets and the use in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were considered, the two-week treatment with 5 mg aserius resulted in an average absorption of symptom (symptom score) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients that received a placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving the symptoms such as Niesen, nasal secretion and itching on the nose, itchiness, trams and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be classified according to the duration of symptoms alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittently allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown in the total corp of the questionnaires at the quality of life at Rhino-economics, Aerius effectively minimises the stress caused by seasonal rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria has been investigated for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathology methods irrespective of the etiology at different forms are similar and chronic patients may be made easier and spectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As the histamine is a significant factor in all urticular disorders, is expected that desloratadine carries out in other forms of urticaria in other forms of urticaria to an improvement of symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the reduction of size and number of paddling at the end of the first dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistaminika in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of the patients who did not react to antihistaminika reacted out of the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement of the itch to increase over 50% was observed at 55% of patients treated with desloratadin patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with aserius reduced the disorder of the sleep and the awareness, as indicated by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmaceutical kinetic study, in which patients were comparable to the overall seasonal-allergic rhinitis, the patients were a higher concentration of desloratadin in 4% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no clue to a clinically relevant Kumulation after once daily application of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The enzyme performed for the Metabolism of Desloratadine, has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines will not be excluded completely.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin hemmed in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro-studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose-study with desloratadin in a dosage of 7.5 mg there are meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) not on the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The study carried out by Desloratadin and Loratadin carried out preclinical studies, with a comparable degree of exposure of desloratadin, no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxicity of desloratadin and by Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on security measurements, toxicity, toxicity and Reproductive Toxicity, the preclinical data cannot be recognized with desloratadin no special dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals, for alleviating the symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persist allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see below 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis are caused by infection in children under 2 years (see below 4.4) and that no data is available which support a treatment of infectious Borrelia initis with aserius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">Besides the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies should be a role in diagnosing the anamnese, physical studies and respective laboratory and skin examinations.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Around 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of abuse of desloratadine metabolic and experience a higher substanzload (see below 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The security of aserius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which can be metabolized, is identical to those in children who are normally metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains Saccharose and Sorbitol, therefore patients with inherited problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-Galactose-absorption or a sacred ase isomaltas- insuffrage not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions have been given as part of clinical studies with aserius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered (see below 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study the anti-consuming effect of alcohol was not amplified (see below 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The total prevalence of side-effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup group as with the placebo group.</seg>

<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of desloratadin in adults can be pre-recorded in adults to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Within a clinical trial with multiplying to adults and adolescents, in desloratadine in a dosage of up to 20 mg every day over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiac effects were described.</seg>

<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the reduction of size and number of paddling at the end of the first dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this restricted phenotypic was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations greater at Black (18% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. shall officially assume the approval for human therapeutic agents (CHMP) officially that the company resumes its application for approval of Aflunov in preventing the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and older people for the protection against flu which is caused by the tribe (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine, which is supposed to protect against a trunk of influenza virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu-pandemic breaks out when a new tribe of the prevention of influenza is emerging, which can easily spread from man to man, because people have not yet established immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the immune system's vaccine as being "physical-virus" and is antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Thus, the immune system is able to form more antibodies in a contact with a flu-virus of this pedigree.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Then the membranes of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane interface, which recognizes the human body as body alien), purified, purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">This increases the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For more information regarding the CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is applied in combination with other antiviral medicines for treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with human immunity leased in type 1 (HIV-1) which is causing the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who can not swallow the capsules, AGM is indeed available as a solution to incineration, but this cannot be taken along with Ritonavir since the security of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">AGM should only then be prescribed if the doctor has examined, which antiviral medicines has previously taken before, and the likelihood is that the virus is appeal to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily, which will be taken together with twice daily 100 mg Ravir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of AGM depends upon the body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Opycase decreases in combination with other antiviral medicines the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS not cure, however, may damage the immune system's damage and thus also delay the development of AIDS-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">AGM has been studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV infected adults, which previously did not have been treated with the protein worms.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This reinforced with low dosiavir increased drug AGM was compared with 206 adults, who had formerly been taken in earlier, with other local easements.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indiindicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with undetectable levels of HIV in the blood (Virtlast), or the change of the virus last after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In trials involving patients who had previously taken no protein vulnerability, after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml as under placebo, but asparase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerative is also the viral burden, however, by the children who had been treated earlier with the worshiper, very few of the treatment mentioned earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study involving adults, who were previously treated with protests were treated with Ritonavir reinforced medicines AGM, the Viruslast after 16-week treatment are just as effective as other local easare:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients suffering from HIV, which was resistant to four other proteasiness, it came under Agenerative along with Ritonavir to a stronger waste from the Viruslast after four weeks as in the patients who did further advance their previous proteasements:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerative ase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), flatulence (flatulence), nauseas (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) against Amstraavir or any of other constituents.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Regenerative may also not be used in patients, Johanniskweeds (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines that are just as well as atherase are being disposed and in high concentrations in the blood health are harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, the risk of a Libra Dystrophy (changes in the distribution of the body fat), an osteonekass card (Abdie of bone tissue) or an immunodeficiency syndroms (symptoms of an infection, caused by the restling immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee on Human Genetics (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of AGM in use with other antiretroviral medicines used to treat with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">AGM is usually taken along with the pharmakokinetic amplifier, but the committee found that the use of AGM in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have previously did not have a proteasiness previously.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "AGM was originally approved under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "", "as for scientific reasons only limited information foreseen." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">October 2000 the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Limited a permit for the marketing of demolition in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">AGM is in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, proteason-treated adults and children from age of 4.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually Agenerative capsules are intended to be given to the pharmacokinetic Boostery of Amstravir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amstravir should be used in consideration of the individual viral agent and treatment of patients (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amstravir as a solution to incision is 14% lower than of Amstraavir as a capsule; hence, Agenerative capsules and solution for inclusion on a milligram per milligram base is not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for amusing capsules is 600 mg Amstraavir twice daily along with 100 mg Ravir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerative capsules are used without the reinforging addition of Ritonavir (Boostery), higher doses must be applied to Agenerative (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerative capsules is 20 mg Amstraavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amstravir which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmaceutical kinetics, effectiveness and safety of asparase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other demonstrators were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Ageneric ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to the lack of data on the immemorial and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerative capsules should be reduced to about 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be carried out with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver disease, in patients with severe liver disease it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Regenerative may not be given simultaneously with drugs that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrom P450-Isoyenzymms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Plant preparations to include Johanniskweeds (hypericum perforatum), may not be used due to risk-reduced plastic decentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of Amstravir during taking Amstravir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be noted that Agenerative or any other antiretroviral therapy does not cause a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with ashrase, does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usually, Agenerative capsules are used along with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral hepatitis therapy have increased risk to severe liver effects with potentially fatal consequences.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the event of the simultaneous treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant technical information of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with existing restricted liver function, including chronic-active hepatitis, an increased frequency of liver dysfunctions under an antiretroviral hepatitis therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of AGM and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other gluten-costeroids that will be confused about CYP3A4 is not recommended, unless that the possible benefits of a treatment the risk of systemic corticosterous the effects including Morbus Cushes and prescribing of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">As the shifting of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of AGM with lovastatin and simvastatin due to the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysen not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Standards-Ratio), are methods of determining the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">For patients who are taking these medicines simultaneously, Agenerative may be less effective because of decreased plastic arasping effects (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Amstravir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive pills may be altered, however the information is not sufficient to estimate the kind of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given simultaneously with Amstravir likewise, patients should therefore be monitored on ovatchment and symptoms, especially if there is also low doses of Ritonavir administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of risk of toxicity due to the high propensity content, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Asparase should be discontinued in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms, or the mucosis involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients, who received an antiretroviral therapy including proteasters, was reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or an Exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases associated with their therapy medicines that are associated with the development of a diabetes mellitus or a hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. Higher age, and with drug dependent factors, like a longer-lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders, is associated.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hämophiles patients (Type A and B), who have been treated with Protcies, there are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous phones and hermarthroes.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with heavy immune defective can develop an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunist infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial tiology is adopted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol intake, heavy immunosuppression, higher Body measure Index), cases of Osteonekcompass in particular were reported in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral hepatitis therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase cannot be given simultaneously with drugs that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrom P450-Isoyenzymms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerative or ritonavir must not be given along with medicines, whose agents are mainly associated with CYP2D6 and are associated with fatal and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin is caused by an 82% reduction in AUC by Amstravir, which can lead to a virological argument and lead to a undesirable development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In trying to get the lowest Plasmaspiegel by a dosage increase of other protein inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very frequently unwanted effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Johanniskweeds (Hypericum perforatum) The serum mirror of Amstraavir can be found by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations by Johanniskweeds (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">When a patient is already taking Johanniskweeds, the picks are avirmirror and, if possible to check the Virglast and put it out.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dosage adjustment for one of the medicine is not necessary, if clinavir is given along with Amstraavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for Cmax on it by 30% if konavir (100 mg twice daily) in combination with Amstraavir capsules (600 mg twice daily) administered.</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg Amstraavir were applied twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which occupy the effectiveness and unobjectionable of this treatment schematas.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower when Amstraavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with lime (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg Ravir twice daily) administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amstraavir in the plasma, which were reached in the combination of Amstravir (600 mg twice daily) with lime (400 mg of Lopinavir twice daily), are about 40 to 50% lower than if Amstraavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg of konavir twice daily administered.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A lecting recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Amstravir and Kaletra may not be given, but it is recommended a engmaschige monitoring, since the effectiveness and the objectionability of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study carried out in combination with Didanosine, but is recommended due to the cid component of Didanosin, that the revenues of Didanosine and ashrase are at least an hour apart (see antazida down).</seg>
<seg id="1972">That is why the gift of Efavirenz is in combination with Amstraavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dosage adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amstraavir and Saquinavir is not recommended, since the exposure of both proteins would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin to other protein easzer and available limited data suggests that Nevirapum might sunk in the serum-concentration of Amstravir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used simultaneously, caution is advised as Delavirdin may be less effective because of the decreased / possibly subtherapeutic plastic araspils.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these medicines are applied together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological checks should be made, as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of vicivir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of Amstravir and Rifabutin led to a rise in the PlasmaConcentration (AUC) of Rifabutin around 193% and with it a rise in the side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">When it is required for clinical reasons, rifabutin has to be arranged with Agenerative or, becomes a reduction in the dosage of a fabutin at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data are available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmaceutical kinetic studies with asparase in combination with erythromycin have not been carried out, but the Plasmaspiegel of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg varicavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in the Cmax. ketoconazole in plasma around 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2,69ple in comparison with the value that was observed after 200 mg Ketoconazole once daily without the simultaneous use of Fosamringavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines, which are listed below, including substrates, inhibit or induction of CYP3A4, can, if they are used together with maple, possibly lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be treated to toxic reactions which are linked with these medicines, if used in combination with maple.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteasiness, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as atherase, as it may come to resilience problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anti-convulsives that are known as enzyme (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with Amstraavir can lead to a humiliation of the plastic pigeon.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The Serum concentrations of calcium-canalers such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, sidewalks, Nikldipin, Niagdipin, Niagdipin and Verapamil can be increased 10 by Amstraavir, thus increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">"" "the simultaneous intake of abuse can considerably increase their plasma-Concentrations and reinforce PDE5 inhibitors in contact side effects including hypotension, visual dysfunctions and priapism (see Section 4.4)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, given in Ritteravir 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4-times a day), the Fluticasonpropionate-plasmaspiegel was significant while the endogenous cortisol increased by approximately 86% (90% VAT interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of ashrase with Ritonavir is not recommended together with these glucose costeroids, unless that the possible benefits of treating the risk of systemic corticosteraken the effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as lovastatin and simvastatin, whose metabolism is heavily dependent on CYP3A4, undermining the plasmaspiegel are expected to be expected in case of congenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Da Plasmaspieffer increase of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors to lead to myopathia including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with Amstravir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended to be a common monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilizing the mirror, as the Plasmakonzentrations of Cyclosporin, rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased by Amstravir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, AGM cannot be used along with oral anecdzolam (see Section 4.3), while in the current use of maple with parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protein eases indicate a possible rise in the Plasmaspiegel of Midazolam around the 3- to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is given along with Amstraavir, patients should therefore be monitored on ovatchment and symptoms, especially if there is also low doses of Ritonavir to be administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the very low perspirality of historical comparisons can currently not be given recommendation, as the Amstraavir- dose is adjusted if Amstraavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With the simultaneous gift of warfarin or other ororal anticoagulants, together with atherase, a strengthened control of INR (International Standards-Ratio) is recommended for the possibility of a weakening or reinforcement of the antithrombogenic effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive pills is not predictible, so as alternative methods of contraception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful supervision of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended in case of simultaneous gift of asparase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This drug may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful removal of possible usability for the mother in comparison with the possible risks to the fetus.</seg>

<seg id="2176">In all studies, Aldara was compared with a placebo (the same cream, but without the substance). • Aldara was tested in four major studies at 923 patients with warts in the genital area for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2177">The main indiindicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete lowering of the treated warts. • Aldara was also treated to 724 patients with small basal cell cancer in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and either placebo or placebo every day or five times a week.</seg>
<seg id="2178">The main indiindicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete withdrawal of tumours after twelve weeks. • Aldara was also tested in two studies on a total of 505 patients with acute keratins.</seg>
<seg id="2179">In all studies, Aldara was more effective than placebo. • At the treatment of heat-treated patients, the complete lowering rate was taken up in all four major studies, but only 3% to 18% in patients treated with placebo-treated patients compared to 0% to 3% in the placebo group treated patients compared to 0% to 3% in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="2180">The most common side effects of Aldara (watched at more than 1 of 10 patients) are reactions at the use of the cream (pain or itch).</seg>
<seg id="2181">Clinically typical, not hypertrophic, not hypertrophic keratosa (AKs) on the face or on the scalp with immunomable adult when the size or the number of lesions limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cryotherapy and contraindicated other topical treatment options is contraindicated or less suitable.</seg>

<seg id="2183">The treatment with Imiquimod cream is to continue as long, until all visible genital warts have disappeared in the genital or interval area, or up to a maximum of 16 weeks a treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="2184">A break in the course described above should be weighed when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur (see Section 4.4) or if the treatment area has been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2185">If follow the follow-up investigation of 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the lesions had only been completely healed should another treatment should be started (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2186">If a dose was dropped out, the patient ought to carry the cream once he / she notices this and then continue with the usual therapy plan.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Imiquimod cream is applied in a thin layer and in the purified way to rub with genital warts, until the cream is reared completely.</seg>
<seg id="2188">It should occur in these patients the risk of treatment with Imiquimod and with the potential worsening of their autoimmune disease risk.</seg>
<seg id="2189">It should be a detective in these patients between the benefits of a treatment with Imiquimod and the associated risk associated with possible organ-versus-hostal reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2190">In other studies where no daily pre-portable toilets were performed, two cases of severe phimosis and a case with one of the circumcision is observed.</seg>
<seg id="2191">When applying Imiquimod cream in higher than the recommended doses there is an elevated risk of heavy local skin irritation (see Section 4.2.) In rare cases, under factional application have been observed severe local skin irritation, which made a treatment required and / or to have temporary physical impairment.</seg>
<seg id="2192">In cases where such reactions at the outcome of the urethra occurred, some women had difficulty passing urine, which claimed an emergency catheterization and a treatment of the affected area.</seg>
<seg id="2193">For the use of Imiquimod cream immediately following a treatment with other cutaneous methods for the treatment of extreme fogenital warts in the genital and pertinal range there are so far no clinical experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Limited data may point to an increased rate of inclination reductions in HIV positive patients, Imiquimod cream, has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient group in relation to the removal of the genital warts.</seg>
<seg id="2195">The treatment of the Basalcell carcinoma carried out with Imiquimod within 1 cm by the eyelids, the nose, the lips or the hairline has not been investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Local work reactions are common, but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during treatment or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is necessary because of the grievances of the patient or due to the severity of local bonding actions, a treatment duration can be made of several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical result of the therapy can be assessed after the treatment of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the treatment of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Because there are no data on long-term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment, other suitable treatment forms should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2200">In patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs do not provide clinical experience, therefore the application is not recommended in pre-treated tumours.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study point out that there is a lower probability of contact to the Imiquimod therapy with major tumors (&gt; 7.25 cm2).</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not examined for the treatment of tinal keratins on eyelids, inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lipstick.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the use of Imiquimod for the treatment of acute keratins on anatomical sites outside of the facial and the scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on pattinal keratosis on sub-arms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application, thus a such application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local work reactions often occur, but these reactions usually take place in the course of therapy for intensity or go back after lowering the therapy with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local community actions are a great discomfort to the patient or are very strong, the treatment may be exposed for several days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical study suggests that patients with more than 8 acts of lesions showed a lesser total healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating properties, Imiquimod cream should be used with caution in patients suffering from immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was examined in four randomised, double-blind-controlled studies in children aged 2 to 15 years with molluscum Contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The effectiveness of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies where they were analysed (3x / week for a &lt; 16 weeks) period.</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimum system of 5% of the Imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute keratosis was observed in the three-three weekly applications during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentric in Serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and begrued 0,1, 0.2 and 1,6 ng / ml in use in the face (12,5 mg, 1 single malfunction), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated obvious half-life period lay approximately 10times higher than the 2hour half-hour after the subcutaneous application in a previous study; this indicates a prolonged retreat of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data for systemic exposures showed that the remainder of Imiquimod was low for topical application of patients aged 6 - 12 years and comparable to that with healthy adult and adults with acute carcinoma cell carcinoma.</seg>

<seg id="2284">In June 2003 the European Commission granted the Genzyme Europe B.V. to approval for the marketing of Aldurazyme across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α-L-Idonidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using recombinant DNA technology using CHO-mammals (Chinese Hamster Ovary, Eierstock of the Chinese Hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is contraindicated in patients with reliable diagnosis of a mukopolysacchariot I (MPS I, α-L-Idonidase deficiency), in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with aldurazyme should take place by a doctor who possesses the experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can, if the patient adds this, every 15 minutes in single-steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h can be increased.</seg>

<seg id="2290">The safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">With Aldurazyme patients treated infusion-conditional reactions which are defined as any associated side effect, which occur during infusion or by the end of the infusion of the infusion (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, specifically those patients should continue to be engtized closely and the infusion of aldurazyme should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment, in the re-livelihood for medical emergencies right away.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 clinical trial, almost all patients IgG-antibodies are to form laronidase, usually within 3 months from the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients to develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution in applying Aldurazyme with caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience regarding the resumption of treatment after a longer break is performed, due to the theoretical risk of a hypersensitivity reaction after a break of treatment should be cautious.</seg>

<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion should be stopped until the symptoms are taken to decrease, a treatment with antihistaminika and acetaminophen / Ibuprofen is considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed with a reduction in fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred to be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and acetaminophen / Ibuprofen and / or Corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in fusion rate of 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate occurred in which the predominant reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not concurrently be used with chloroquin or procain because a potential risk of interference with the intracellular picture of Laronidase exists.</seg>

<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns, which were exposed to Laronidase, above the mother's milk, is recommended to satisfy during the treatment with aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The side effects in clinical studies were predominantly shown to be infusion-conditioned reactions which were observed at 53% of patients in Phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under the age of 5 (treatment duration of up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse reactions arising in connection with Aldurazyme that were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension of a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a total treatment duration of up to 4 years: very common (≥ 1 / 10); common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>

<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of undesirable pharmaceutical drugs, even though the occurrence of undesirable pharmaceutical drugs typically coincided with the formation of IgG-antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The basis for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of the immaculate.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed in cells into the Lysosomes, most likely above Mannosis-6-phosphorus receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms were randomised in a randomised, double-blind, placements controlled phase-3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited to study the entire disease spectrum was the majority of patients from the average phenotype and only a patient pointed to the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited when they had a forcized expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change to the expected FEV and the absolute distance in 6-minute cases.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited by an open-label hiding place where they received another 3,5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 E / kg aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with aldurazyme patients treated with the placebo group an improvement of the lung function and the enviability which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open discussion survey showed an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as emerged from the following table.</seg>

<seg id="2597">Choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and learn to feed permanently healthy.</seg>
<seg id="2598">Energy is also measured in kilojoule, which you can also find as indication of the packaging of foods. • The recommended calorie intake provides, how many calories you should take a maximum of per day.</seg>
<seg id="2599">Note the tables below in this section. • The recommended fatty acid in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Which amount for you is suitable, take the look below, which is the number of calories you are suitable for you. • Due to the effect of the capsule is the observance of the recommended fetters.</seg>
<seg id="2601">When you take the same amount of fat as before, this may mean that your body cannot process these amount of fat.</seg>
<seg id="2602">By keeping the recommended flow rates, you can maximize the weight reduction and decrease the probability of nutrition-conditional onset. • You should try to gradually increase steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2603">34 This decreased calorie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight about 0,5 kg per week to develop without frustrations and disappointments.</seg>
<seg id="2604">The more active you are, the higher your recommended amount of calories. • "low physical activity" means you work each day only little or no longer, stairs, work in the garden or to burn other physical activities, e.g. by moving daily 150 kcal, e.g. by 3 km walking, 30- to 45-minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2605">• For lasting weight reduction, it is necessary to put a realistic caloride and liposuction goals and also adhere to them. • wisely is a nutritional piece of food with details about the calories- and fat content of your meals. • Try to move more before you begin with the intake of alli.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapy regimen, which are strong catalytic nausea and vomiting (like cisplatin), as well as for chemotherapy regimens, which are moderate-chains for nausea and vomiting (like Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a corticosteroids (a medicine used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended, as the effects contained in this age group does not have enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance, the bond of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), prevents the receptors in the gut.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three major studies of 1 842 adults, who received chemotherapy regimen, which are powerful or even solvers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapy regimens, the strong catalyst for nausea and vomiting are, 59% of the patients were treated with aloes, in the 24 hours following chemotherapy no vomiting (132 from 223), compared with 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron's patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapy regimen, which are moderate-solvers for nausea and vomiting are exhibited, 81% of the patients were treated with aloxi, in the 24 hours following chemotherapy no vomiting (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron treated patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">With a comparison with Dolasetron, these values stood at 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005 the European Commission granted Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. for a permit for the marketing of Aloxi in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: to prevent nausea and vomiting with severe emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and to prevent nausea and vomiting at moderate emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of aloes to prevent nausea and vomiting which is induced by a severely emetogenic chemotherapy can be amplified by adding one before the Corticosteroids may be amplified.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonotic tron is able to extend the colon fish, patients should be supervised with anamnesty Obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus after the injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable in the simultaneous gift of Palonotic tron with drugs that extend the QT interval or in patients, where the QT interval is extended or those tend to be such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Other than in connection with other chemotherapeutic agents, Aloxi is supposed to be used in the days after chemotherapy neither to prevent nausea nor treat nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosis investigates tumors of the five investigational cancer therapeutics (cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Cycloabin, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical trial, there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose of Palonotic tron and a stealth stateha concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based on a population-based pharmacokinetic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6 inductors (Dexetidine, Cimetidine, Chinidine, Pinidine, ritonavir, Sertralin and Terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonotic tron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences relating to the application of Ponotic tron in human pregnancies will not be found, therefore Palonotic tron should not be used in pregnant or pregnant, unless it is considered by the general practitioner as necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trial, the most common of a dose of 250 micrograms to observe effects (a total of 633 patients), which at least possibly were associated with aloes, headaches (9%) and obstruction (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity and reactions to the administration (burning, curing, complaints and pains) were given in post-marketing experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar types of undesirable events demonstrated by undesirable events as in the other doses; there were no dose-active relations to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">There have been no dialysis studies done, due to the large sharing volume, however, is probably not effective therapy with a aloe overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients, which received a moderate emetogenic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 cclophoton, &lt; 1.500 mg / m2 of Cyclophoton (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg of Dolasetron (half-time 7.3 hours), which was given by day 1 without Dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind experiment, a total of 667 patients, which received a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cclophosphamide, and Dacarbazin as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosis tron received, were given intravenously on day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderate emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strong emetogenic chemotherapy is summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were similar to the effects of Palonotic tron on blood pressure, heart rate and cardiogram parameters including the QTc intervalls with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings pre-clinical studies, Palonotic tron has the ability to block on the ventricular de- and repolarization of the Ion channels and prolonging the duration of the action destination.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy Probanden was the assessment of the EKG effect of i.V. administered by I.C.I.tron in solitary doses of 0.25, 0.75, and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous Gabe performs an initial decrease of the Plasmakonzentrations a slowing elimination of the body with an average season-time of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plastic Concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentrate-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally in the whole dosage area of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to the Gift of Palonotic tron was 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses from day 1 and day 5 measured average (± SD) increase in the Palonosis tron-plasmakonzentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations, that with a daily intravenous Gift of 0.25 mg Palonosis amounted to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) with which was measured by 0.75 mg after the previous intravenous administration; however, the Cmax was higher than 0,75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated via the kidneys, and about another 50% are converted into two primary metspans that have compared to Palonotic tron over less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro-studies for metacterisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser extent, are involved with Isoys CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 at the Metabolism of Palonotic tron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosis tron was found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in urine, Palonotic tron as unchanging active substance made some 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous line-injection at healthy, the whole body-tension was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renale Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver dysfunctions are the terminale elimination of elimination and the average systemic exposure to Palonotic tron, a reduction in the dose is therefore not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were only observed according to expositions, which are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, indicating low relevance to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies revealed the evidence that Palonotic tron is only blocking at very high concentrations of Ion channels, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and can extend the term potential.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonotic tron (each dose was given in about the 30times of therapeutic exposure to men), which have been given daily over two years resulted in a multiplied incidence of liver tumours, endocrine Neoplasms (thyroid, pancreas, spellarmark) and skin tumours in rats, but not with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high doses and da aloes used to unique use, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2649">The approval of this permit is to notify the European Commission on the plans for the unloading of the drug in the context of this decision approved.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the committee for human therapeutic agents (CHMP) adopted a negative expertise, recommended for the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C to the treatment of hepatitis C with Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injecting solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon a biological drugs called" "" "Roferon-A" "" "is similar to the same pharma-like effective part that is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference practitioner" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for treating adult patients with chronic (long prolonged) hepatitis C (one by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue damage occurs, in addition, the values of liver enzymms alanine Amino-ferase (ALT) increases in the blood standard.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) was introduced that inspires this to the formation of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon submitted data that testify to the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode, safety and effectiveness at hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients with hepatitis C, the efficiency of Alpheon has been compared with the efficacy of the reference system using 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">In the study, how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after the treatment of treatment is aniced (that is, no sign of the virus referred to in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns were expressed in detail that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug are not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, who spoke to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting treatment with Alpheon, the disease flammates more patients than with the reference made of reference; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that the test was examined in the study, to how far the medicine is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine) is not sufficient validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat improvisations (one with crust formation-like skin infections) and small inexperienced plinations (Riss- or chifaded), depreciation and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo does not have to be used for treating infections, which were proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant to sthylococcus aureus (MRSA), because Alargo does not work against these kinds of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied to patients from the age of nine months, but patients under the age of 18 may not exceed 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient relates not to treatment two or three days, the doctor should re-examine the patient and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works through blockage of bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterienzelle, in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indication of the effectiveness was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was contaxed after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients below Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo based on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected animals, Altargo and Cefalexin similar contact points: when the results of both studies were viewed at home-rounds, about 90% of the patients of both groups spoke on treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, that Altargo was found in the treatment of abscesses (time-filled hohlrooms in the body tissue) or from infections that were verifiably or presumably by MRSA, is not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side-effect with Altargo (which has been observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation to the Convent.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Human Genetics (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo on the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections in relation to the risks outweighs: • Impetigo, • infected small infiations, depreciation or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007 the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the marketing of Altargo in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients, in which there are no improvement of improvement within two or three days, are to be considered once more and an alternative therapy can be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of raising awareness or severe local irritation by the application of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment has been interrupted, the salbe carefully ascertain and an appropriate alternative therapy for the infection can be begun.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not intended to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies with secondary wounds, the effectiveness of Retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin reshaphazhylococcus aureus (MRSA) were not enough.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered, if after a 2-3-day treatment, no improvement or a deterioration of an infected person occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical funds on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Because of low plastic Concentrations, which were reached in humans for topical skin or infected superficially wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition can not be expected in vivo (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous gift of 2 times a day 200 mg Ketoconazole increased the middle reapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% Retapamulin salbe on the meager skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application patients are not considered necessary, if topical retapululin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reaction-up iciricity after oral intake and are inadequate in regards to a statement on the birth and the Federal Republic of gender / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should be used during pregnancy only if a topical anti-bacterial therapy is clear and the use of reacts in the gift of a systemic antibiotic is to be preferred.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether the breastfeeding continued / ended or the therapy with Altargo continued / ended is between the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefits of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies on 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo applied, the most commonly reported side-effect irritation at the administration, which regarded approximately 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Effectiveness Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by Fermentation from Clitopilus passeumanus (formerly priurotus passeckanus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The novel mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective imitation of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction in a particular bond of the 50s sub-unit of the bacterial Ribosoms which differs from the links of other ribosomal interacting anti-bacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the relationship point ribosomales protein L3 involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-connecting center and the PeptidyltransferasezCentre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Through loyalty to this bond-like Puromuttiline, the Peptidyltransfer, blocking partial P-Binding interactions and prohibits the normal formation of active 50s ribosomous subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should be due to the local predicence of the resistance to the application of Retapamulin at least some infection forms, should be targeted through experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the In-vitro activity of Retapamulin towards S.p.reus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the event of nonresponse to the treatment at S.aurreus, the presence of tribes with additional Virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Subscription in a study with healthy adults was made 1% Retapamulin Salbe daily under occlusion on intact and tilted skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days to topical treatment of secondary wounds, individual plastic robes have been won.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sample took place in the days 3 or 4 in adult patients just before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last use.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake by the people after topical application of 1% salbe on 200 cm2 meager skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660-times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolites The in vitro oxidative metabolites of Retapamulin into humanized liver microsummer was primarily conveyed by CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies for oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) that were executed over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is committed to protecting hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases that concern the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not immun against these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is normally applied within two doses of existing vaccines, whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason it may only be used when immunisation there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and it is ensured that the vaccination plan can be led to an end from two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desired against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another HCV or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by bringing the immune system (the natural defences of the body) "how it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens than "alien" and generates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccination for Twinrix adults since 1996 and has been approved in 1997 with Twinrix Children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same diseases, however Twinrix adults and Twinrix Children are administered as part of a three doses of existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults are included, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults, also used as testament to the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indiindicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children, which had developed a protective antibody-concentric one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to six months and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambily took about 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambily was similar to a sever and a 12-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side-effects of Ambirix (watched at more than 1 of 10 vaccine) are headaches, appetite deficiency, pain at injection, redness, matiness (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambient may not be used in patients, which may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other constituents or Neomycin (an antibiotic) are not used.</seg>

<seg id="2739">The Standardianplan for the Grundimmunization with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the initial dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher age is desired for hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the relevant monovals vaccines or with a combined effect.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-Hepatitis B virus (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are to be found in the same size as after the vaccination with the respective monovarian vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully backed, if immune competent individuals who have addressed to a Hepatitis A- vaccination, a refresher immunisation might require no longer detectable antibodies possibly through the immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection insulation, for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction, according to the gift of the vaccine appropriate options of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is recommended, the Standardisation scheme is recommended with the combination of the combination of the ultrasper-type virus-A-virus and 10 µg recombinable Hepatitis B type.</seg>
<seg id="2745">For modifying patients and persons with disruptions of the immune system, there is no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies, so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2746">As an intraomale injecting or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscle could lead to a subtle impact success, these injection molds should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, in Throgenic cytopia or clotting disorders, Ambily can be injected under subcutaneous as it may occur in these cases after intra-muscular Gabe.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was given in the second year in the form of a separate injection, tooed Poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza type b-vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combined measles tube vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was adequate (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients suffering from immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defective need to be understood that perhaps no adequate immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical trial involving 3 vaccinvertebrates of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, sleepiness, gastroenteritis, headache and fever comparable to the incidence observed in the earlier Thiomerisation and preservative.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccinations were administered to a total of 1027 vaccinations at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-cans combinationery.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and timeliness on a calculation basis per inoculosis ambient, however, not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed at 50,7% of the goods observed at 50,7% of the probes, compared with 39,1% in the probes after the Gift of a dose of 3-cans combinationery.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the entire vaccination cycle 66,4% of the subjects, that had given ambient temperature, about pain, compared to 63.6% at the probes, which have been vaccinated with the 3-Dos- Combination.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the incidence of mat was comparable to a promill (that is, through the whole vaccine of 39.6% of the probes received that Ambies were received, compared with 36.2% at the probes received the 3-cans combination.).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pompted pain and ariness was small and comparable that was observed after administration of the composite wood with the 3-cans vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparatively study with 1- to 11-year vaccine, the appearance of local interactions and general interactions was comparable to that in administration with the 3-doses combined with 360 ELISA-units deactivating HCV-A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B virus.</seg>
<seg id="2759">At the 6- to 111s, however, after vaccination with ambiante a common occurrence of pain (at the injection) per dose, does not report per proband.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported on severe side-effects during the 2-doses inoemen with Ambirix or during the 3-cans vaccine involves the combination of hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B virus that was statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials, carried out in vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the seroconversionate rates for anti-HAV 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to month 6 charged dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>

<seg id="2764">For the 289 persons whose ImmunoGen, were outstandalone, were the Seroprotetraction rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of 3-Dosenimp it significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which was reached in a clinical comparative study with 1- up to 11-year-old a month after completion of the full vaccinations (i.e. in the month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccinations were received either a 2-doses vaccine with Ambirix or a 3-cans vaccine scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA-units deactivating HCV-A-Virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For those who were at the time of the Grundimmation between 12 and 15 years, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies could be proven for at least 24 months after the immunisation with Ambirix which takes place in the 0-6-month vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immuno-reaction against both antigens was comparable to that, after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination of combinant hepatitis A-virus and 10 µg recombinable hepatitis B substances in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial at 12- up to 15-year-old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies are comparable to that of the 0-12 months vaccine scheme in the 0-12 months vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">When the first dose of Ambily in the second year at the same time with the contraction of a combined diphthiece, tetanus-, azellular Persian-vaccine administered (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with the initial dose of a combined measles tube-vaccinated vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was adequate.</seg>

<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can express itself through juicy skin rashes, airplanes or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have been an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B if you / your child has a serious infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the prior arrangement of the second vaccination osis).</seg>
<seg id="2785">With a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / her child of a vaccination with ambient.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined Hepatitis A- / Hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective components per vaccine (360 ELISA-units of a formal hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant Hepatitis B surface).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination osis of this vaccine with decreased content to effective components is usually administered a month after the initial dose and might give you a vaccination protection before ending the vaccination.</seg>

<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for the vaccine and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, should be vaccinated at separate places and as diverse as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be adequate.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Normally, ambient or nursing women is not administered, unless it is imperative that they be vaccinated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data, which has been known since issuance of the first permit for marketing, the CHMP opinion that the benefits risk for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However since Ambirix not only been placed in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients aged over a month using incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonastic extensions (brain injury as a result of high ammonium Concentrations) in pre-history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps is - split up on several single doses to meals - swallowed, among the food mixed or via a gastrostoma tube (by the abdominal wall in the stomach of leading bottles) or a nose-probe (through the nose into the stomach-leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, since Ammonaps did not compare to any other treatment or placebo (hypocrisy medication, that is to be compared without any substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonaps can also lead to loss loss in blood, depression, irritability, headaches, impotence, fluid pain, fluid pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, uncomfortable body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Human Genetics (CHMP) came to the conclusion that Ammonaps was effective in patients with disorders of the urinary tract to high ammonious levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonaps was approved under "extraordinary circumstances," as due to the rarity of the illness, there was only limited information about this medicine at the time of approval.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indexed in all patients, in which a complete enymous lack is already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 lifetime).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manium form (inctive Enzymdefect, which manifests itself after the first life-month) then there is an indication for use when in the Anamnese is a hyperammonic Encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with lockdysfunctions AMMONAPS is also available in granule form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is assessed individually in consideration of protein and the growth and development of the patient's daily protein intake.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose Natriumphenylbutyat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manium shortage of carbamide, phosphoretase or ornithinimcarbbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an argininosappinatsynthetase deficiency need arginine in a dosage of 0,4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets should not be given to patients with gorges, as there is a risk for the emergence of ovskating hulzera if the tablets do not immediately arrive into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Every tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, accordingly 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium and 20 g sodium phenylbutyat, resulting in maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive heart failure or serious kidney failure as well as with sodium and eco-formation and are only used with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since Metabolization and excretion of sodium phenylbutyat are carried out above the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous gift of phenylacetate to young rats in high Dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowing of neuronal multiplication and a heightened loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a hesitated maturing of crebrals synapses and a diminished number of working nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be noted whether phenylacetate was eliminated in the mother's milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least an undesirable event (AE) and at 78% of these undesirable events was assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported from an 18 year old anormal patient, which developed an metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactaziosis, heavy hypokalemia, pheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred during a 5 month old small child with a cute single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate, resulting in intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dose-limiting neurotoxicity shown.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active connection that runs through Acetyulation with glutamine by phenylacetylglutamine, which is left out of the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Polyechiometric are seen phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen-atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is thus used as an alternative carrier for the reduction of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urinary cycle can be assumed to be produced for each grammes sodium inphenylbutybean between 0,12 and 0,15 g Phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is crucial that the diagnosis was put at an early stage and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival chances and the clinical result.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manium form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infrst, and the disease itself lead to death with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids, or their sticky-free analogues inside the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hubalysis, the exploitation of alternative paths of nitrogen oxidized (sodium and sodium acetate), proteinated Kost and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to raise the survival rates of new-born at postpartal (however within the first month of life) to raise diseases on 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy, the survival rates were treated 100%, but even in these patients it was time with many to intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manium form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygots form of the orniotic transcarbbamylase deficiency), which were treated by a hyperammonary Encephalopathy and then permanently treated with sodium phenylbutyat and a proteinated diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is well-known that phenylbutylic acid is oxidized, which is caused in liver and kidney disease, with Glutamin konjuy, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutywood and its metabolites in plasma and urine have been assessed according to gift healthy adult and in patients with disorders of the urinary tract, the hemoglobalized metabolism and with liver cirrhosis as well as repeated gifts of oral cans of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyat and its metabolites has also been studied in cancer patients following intravenous polyphenylbutyat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After a single dose of 5 g sodium inphenylbutyat in tablet form, 15 minutes after taking measurable PlasmaConcentrations were found by phenylbutyat.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with uric-cycle disorders or haegloomy compared to different doses Phenylbutyat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) in the next morning after nocturnal fasting, no Phenylacetate in the plasma was detectable.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeated with sodium acetylbutyat (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the middle phenylacetate-centrations are exceeded the third day five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The drug is eliminated within 24 hours by about 80 - 100% in the form of the fierce product Phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus tests had oriumphenylbutyat with toxic and non-toxic doses treated rats has no enclave effects (investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 up to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is taken either oral (infants and children, which can still not swallow tablets or have patients with lockdysfunctions) or via a gastrostomy or a nostripe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose Natriumphenylbutyat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborn children, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteine in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manium shortage of carbamide, phosphoretase or ornithinimcarbbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium inyrat, accordingly 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium and 20 g sodium phenylbutyat, resulting in maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rats were exposed to the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolic acid of phenylbutyat), it came to lesions in the pyramid cells of the brain rinde.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported from an 18 year old anormal patient, which developed an metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactaziosis, heavy hypokalemia, pheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Fuylchiometric are seen phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen-atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is thus used as alternative carrier for the elimination of excess ships.</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle can be presumed that for every gram it is produced by sodium acetylbutyl glutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the treatment, and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutywood in granule form, 15 minutes after the intake measurable of phenylbutyrate were found.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of life the patient can keep the ready product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">For this procedure the small measuring spoon was 0.95 g, the middle measuring spoon 2,9 g and the large measuring stick 8.6 g Natriumphenylbutyat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to obtain the medication above a probe, AMMONAPS can be dissolved in water before use also in water (the solubility of sodium-phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases are missing certain liver enzymes, so that they accumulate the suffocated waste products which can accumulate in the body after consuming proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you have studied laboratory studies, you have to inform the doctor that you may take AMMONAPS, since sodium inphenylbutyat may affect the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>

<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with Angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Roughly 14 000 patients took part in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiomox is compared to alline-IIb / IIIA-Inhibitor (GPI, another medicine to prevent clots) with the conventional compostoperative treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During PCI the patient was often a stent (a short tube that remains in the lottery to prevent a zipper), and they received additionally other medicines for preventing blood clots, such as dexximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiomox - with or without gift of GPI - in preventing recent events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year overall as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronarsyndromes (instabile Angina / non-Hebrew) attack (IA / NSTEMI)) at an emergency number or if an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended Initial dose of Angiox on patients with ACS is a intravenous herd of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is carried out in a further series of PCI, an additional bolt of 0,5 mg / kg should be increased and the infusion should be increased to the duration of the surgery on 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, a bolster of 0,5 mg / kg shall be given, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhinoplasty.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiomox in patients with a PCI intravenous subfusion of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one in this immediately subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a alluity-gift from Angival has not been studied and is not recommended, even though a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolster of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to decrease the occurrence lower ACT values, the pertinent and diluted medicine should be carefully arranged prior to the application and the Bolusdosis can be given intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer necessary, provided that 1.75 mg / kg infusion osis is given correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function (GFR 30-59 ml / min) that are subjected to a PCI (whether with Bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is 2225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.1 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bolusdosis occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney injury, which was included in the phase III- PCI study (Replace-2) that was included in the approval, the ACT was worth 5 minutes to the Gift of the Bivalorudin-Bolus without tin-adaptation at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney injury (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also at dialysis patient-payment is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiomox can be initiated by 30 minutes after the treatment of the subcutted Heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous status of low molecular yeast.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the substance or other constituents or against brain species • active bleeding or increased blood pressure risk. • severe uncontrollable hypertension and / or irreversible kidney injury. • severe kidney injury (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and at dialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are treated carefully in terms of treatment carefully with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when Bivalorudine is given in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if PCI-patients may occur in Bivalirudine most bleeding in arterial punctuation, can undergo from patients who undergo a peraneous corbic system (PCI) during the treatment in principle throughout bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients suffering from the warfarin and treated with Bivalirudine, a surveillance of the INR value (International Standards-ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value of the treatment with Bivalirudin has once again reached the level of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge about the mechanism of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warbird, warfarmed, throtationolytics or Thrombozytheliemmer) it can be understood that these agents increase the bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of Bivalirudine with Throradial aggregate, or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasees parameters are regularly controlled by regular intervals.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental studies are inadequate in terms of pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see below 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudine plus GPIIb / IIIA Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either fragile Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIA Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalorudine group as well as in those with hoin-treated comparative groups, it came in women as well as in patients over 65 years more often at undesirable events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Heavy bleeding were defined according to the ACUITY and TIMI measures for heavy bleeding as well as in the footnotes of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding performed under Bivalirudine alone significantly less often than in the groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIA-Inhibitor and Biographiimdine plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding has been defined as one of the following events: deposits, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the punctuation, reduction of the hemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood pressure, reoperation due to a bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">More, less frequently observed hemorlocations that occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" punctuation, retroperitoneal, gastroboard, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side-effects are based on the data of a clinical study involving Bivalirudine at 6000 patients who undergo a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalorudine group as well as in those with hoin-treated comparative groups, it came in women as well as in patients over 65 years more often at undesirable events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred among Bivalirudine significantly less often than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIA-Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects which are listed above were reported on extensive use in practice and are summarized in chart 6 after extensive use.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In the case of overdose the treatment with Bivalirudine is immediately canceled and the patient engmaschige in terms of signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angival contains Bivalirudine, a direct and specific Thrombininhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic centre and also on the Anioloenkaration region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether it is tied in a liquid phase or to Gerinnie.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The bond of Bivalirudine in Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin on the one hand is slowing the bond of Bivalirudine-Arg3-Pro4, whereby the function of the active center of Thrombin regenerated.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, it was caused by Bivalirudine with Serum from patients, in which there was in the past to induparable thyroism syndrome (HIT / HITTS) (HIT / HITTS), induce no "" "" Throism "" "" reaction. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients Bivalirudine shows a dose-dependent anticoagulatoric effect that is occupied by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was conducted with the patients following a PCI, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg Bivalirudine should be increased and the infusion should be increased to the duration of the surgery on 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY CCI was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute Coron syndrome (ACS) in patients with instabiler Angina / non-ST-Hebrobbery (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain an GPIIb / IIIA Inhibitor either before the start of angiography (at the time of Randomisation) or when PCI.</seg>

<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple-end points of a randomised double blind study with over 6,000 patients that subjected to a PCI (Replace 2), are shown in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients supplied limited information on the use of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalirudine were evaluated in patients, subjected to a peraneous coronarless (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudine as Peptid catabolism in its amino acid constituents with subsequent revaluation of the amino acids in the body-pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metelit, which results from the splitting of the Arg3-Pro4 bond of N-terminalen sequence through Thrombin results, is not effective due to the loss of his affinity to the catalytic centre of thyrombin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, juveniles and children from six years of age with diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm injected or administered as a permanent fusion with a insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin in the control of the glucose level (sugar) produced in the blood or may process insulin in its entirety.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin pump is very different to human insulin, and the change means that it has a faster effect and it has a shorter activity of time than a short-effective humanism.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with an effective insulin in patients with type-1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between 4 and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type-2 diabetes, in which the body of insulin is not effectively processed, Apidra was examined in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indiindicator of the effectiveness was the change of concentration of the substance glycosylified hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study involving adult with type-1 diabetes was established after six months a reduction of 0.14% (of 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c-concentration was 0.46% after six months with apidra in comparison to 0.30% on human normal levels.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra should not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) against insulin or one of the other components, or in patients suffering already at a hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">September 2004 the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the marketing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injections either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thighs or the delhathmus or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal decks.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the diminished Glucoseogenesis capacity and the decrease of insulin, the insulin can be demoted in patients with a restriction of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in the force, the mark (supply), the insulin type (normal, NPH, or cancer, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method may draw a change of insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosage or demolition of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-aid diabetes may lead to a hyperglycaemia and a diabetic ketoaziosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Adjustment of a patient to another insulin or a insulin should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may take a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of a hypoglycaemia is dependent on the activity profile of the used insulin and can therefore change in the conversion of the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Among the substances that may increase the blood sugar intake and increase the inclination to hypoglycaemias, include oral antidiabetic, analgesic, Fluoxetine, fluoxetine, oxocide, Salicylates, Salicylates and sulphamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effects of sympatholytics such as Betablockers, Clonidin, Guanacidine and Reserva the symptoms of adrenal glands are alleviated or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies for reproductionism showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and humaneness in terms of pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or the postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin is impenetrated into human mother's milk, but insulin is generally not absorbed into the breast milk, nor is it absorbed into oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Below are the results of clinical trials known as undesirable drug stimulties, grouped according to system organically and ordered according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very often: ≥ 1 / 100; &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (incidence on the basis of ordain data not obtainable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold cuts, cool and bale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration camps, benommenities, excessive dog, headache, headache, nausea and cardiac tps.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodstreamystrophy failed to switch the injection point within the injection range, may result in a result of a Lipodstreamystrophy at the injection station.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaemias with consciousy can be treated by a intra-muscular or subcutaneous injection of glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg) that is given by a physician according to intravenous gift, or treated by a doctor by intravenous motif.</seg>
<seg id="2991">According to a glucose level, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to identify the Ur- item for the heavy hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces the blood sugar levels through the stimulation of the peripheral glucose absorption (especially by skeletal muscle and fat) as well as by inhibiting the glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that during subcutaneous fork in the efficiency occurs faster and the time duration is shorter than with hustmanem normal.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male people aged 21 up to 50 years with type-1 diabetes, insulin pump showed insulin in therapeutical effect in therapeutical effect on the dose of 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg, and 0,3 E / kg or more of a disproportionate increase in the draft carving effect, exactly like human.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin pump is twice as fast functioning as the normal human system and achieves the complete draft loss of about 2 hours earlier than human cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data, it was obvious that in an application of insulin pump in 2 minutes before Meal, a comparable glycemic control is achieved like with humaneness, which is 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulin pump was reached in 2 minutes before the meal, a better sobridial control was achieved than with human average tipping, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Insulin is reached in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparative glycaemic control is achieved like with human normal weight, which is given 2 miths before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery occurs in Gabe 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the beginning of the meal in comparison to human normal weight, which was 30 minutes (normal - 30 minutes) before the beginning of the meal (figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal weight, which was given 2 minutes (normal - before) before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin delivery in Gabe 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after) after the beginning of the meal compared to human normal painting, which was 2 minutes (normal - before) before the beginning of the meal (figure 1C).</seg>
